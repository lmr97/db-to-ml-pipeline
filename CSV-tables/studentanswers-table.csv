869,109,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or don't like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school. Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home. These online and distance learning classes can help students get back on track with school and catch up with their work that they missed. The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that don't like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot. These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work. I think this can benefit students because they are in the comfort of their homes and its like a regular class but it just online and you could get all your work done and by that you earn good grades. If students who don't like coming to school,sickly and get bullied,always miss class and get bad grades because their are not their to take tests or quizzes then these online and distance class can benefit them to do work at the comfort of their home. It will also persuade them to not give up on school and give them a right to get their education before they throw it away. These online classes and distance classes can help teach these students as if they were in school and if they work hard enough they can get good grades. These are all reasons why these programs can benefit student.","The innovations in the field of facial recognition and analysis have expanded beyond just identifying someone based on a picture. Now, computers with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can identify human emotions from facial expressions. This innovation would be a valuable asset if used in a classroom environment due to it making it easier on teachers and helping student actually understand and learn the material. One reason this technology would be valuable in the classroom is the aid it would provide to teachers. FACS can recognize when students are confused or bored by analyzing their facial expressions and each ""action unit,"" which is movement of one or more facial muscles. No teacher can always recognize when a student is zoned out or confused, which is why employing FACS to do it for the teachers would be extremely valuable. One of the primary developers of the technology, Dr. Huang, says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" By recognizing boredom or confusion and notifying the teacher, FACS helps teachers be able to recognize when their lesson is not being effectively heard by their students. FACS also changes the lesson plan when it recognizes that a student is bored or confused, which helps the teacher keep the class engaged and allows them to participate more. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to the help it would give teachers by enhancing their lesson. Another reason FACS would be valuable in the classroom is that it would tremendously help students actually understand what they are learning. Students do not always understand what they are being taught, and even though they might not understand they often do not ask questions to clarify. This means that students are basically just being talked at, with it all just going above their heads. However, when FACS recognizes that a student doesn't understand or is bored it ""... could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" says Dr. Huang. This means that when a student needs help understanding something the computer will cater to each student until it senses that they understand the lesson. This could drastically improve participation and engagement in the classroom by ensuring that each student understands. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to it helping students learn more effectively. Through its ability to help both teachers and students, FACS would be a valuable asset in the classroom. Sitting in classrooms around the world right now are students who do not understand what they are being taught. This could be changed forever with the implementation of FACS in the classroom, with a smaller percentage of students failing classes and a higher level of understanding being a direct result from the implementation of FACS.                ","I think that this image of this face is very neat. Although I think that the face is real, but I dont think that the aliens did it though. I think that it was just nature made. Just like how if we are outside sometimes in the woods or just out in the yard you see like a heart shape or any shape on and object. You think its really neat and all but it doesnt go through your head that a strange living person made it. I know that it is on a diferant planet, and that we are looking for life some where else, but personaly I do not think that it is made by aliens. Just because they think that there is some other life out there doesnt mean that that life made this. If there was other life out there they would have been able to see the life moving around. Like us in the city or something we have monuments and statutes and they are all in or very close to the city. We dont just build somethng and have it we out where no one will go. There all in the city. So dont you think that the aliens would be out around admireing it, and looking at it. This is what I think.

","Voting has been a legal write of all people since our country was established, but is the way we vote recieving some resistance? The electoral college is the way we vote now and the way weve been doing it for years. So why change it? For the sake of fairness and accuracy. People from all around the country don't think that the electoral college is a intelligent way of voting. So they are fighting changing the electoral process to popular vote rather than voting for a state of electors. Our best arument we have to go against the electoral college is the disaster factor. Document 1 "" What Is the Electoral College? "" states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is basically saying we can't trust our electors to really vote for what they are assigned. That is like not being able to rely on the school bus to take you to school in the morning, its not a great sense of doubt. Another reason not to use this outlandish method of voting is that the total number of electoral votes (538) is an even number. Which means there could be a tie. Another thing worth mentioning is that one candidate can win the popular vote but have fewer electoral votes. That is exactly what happened to Al Gore and that was largely part of this bogus system our country continues to uphold. The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better. And it should be strongly considered in the comig years.                                                            ","Distractive driving Two seconds is all it takes to risk the lives of the driver and people on the road. For the driver to take their eyes and brain off the task of driving is highly dangerous. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they are putting their safety and others endangered and risk rising insurance prices. Multitasking and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is distracting to the driver, which can be life-threatening. Distractive driving effects all drivers equally whether the driver is talking on the phone, texting, on social media, or taking photos. For example, Emily wrote, ""Unfortunately, more and more people are making the dangerous decision to text and drive, which causes 1.6 million crashes and almost 400,000 injuries per year, according to The National Safety Council-that's one out of every four car accidents!""(Delbridge) In other words, studies found that operating a mobile phone while driving slows the reaction time of the driver, and restricts a driver's perception skills; which increases the likelihoods of being involved in a collision. Distractive driving is equivalent to drunk driving because the behavior causes negative consequences that are life threatening. Especially for inexperience drivers and those who lack skill. To add on, the ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"" states, ""In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States."" (Distracted Driving Research) All driver should know that if they cause an accident because of risky behavior, their car insurance rate will certainly increase. It is important to know because the bad behavior of distractive driving can have an impact on other drivers too. For instance, Emily's article states, ""Because of this, car accident rates have risen over 14 percent since 2014. Not only does this make driving more dangerous for everyone, but it also contributes to increased car insurance premiums for everyone."" (Delbridge) The car insurance premiums are established by many different components, including the drivers' neighborhood, age, distance of commute, driving history, and the behavior of other drivers. The last category is why texting and driving effects everyone. Those who tend to use their cellphone while driving is the reason that the annual U.S. traffic fatalities are rise with insurance claims. Drivers should not use their mobile phone in any way while operating any motorize vehicle. If there is any need to use the cellphone for emergencies, the GPS, or music, Please, pullover or do it before you start to proceed driving. In conclusion drivers need to drive and only drive because whatever it is that is distracting is not worth people's lives. Work Cited Delbridge, Emily.

Wallington 3            ","Exploring New Places ""Studying the planets is a amazing thing,"" said my science teacher. When studying the planets there is a lot of information to take in. The atomposhere on Earth is very different from the atmosphere in space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Scientists should study Venus because it has similarites to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there. Venus is known as Earth's twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states in paragraph 4 ""Today, Venus still ahs some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This proves that Venus has some identical features to those that Earth has. It also states in paragraph 4 ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This also proves that Venus has some similar characteristics like Earth. This is how the Earth is similar to Venus and why scientist should continue to study the planet, consdering its dangers. The idea of sending humans to Venus is a topic up for debate by many scientists. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains how NASA has the idea of sending humans to Venus. It states in paragraph 5 ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This shows how scientists have come up with a way to send humans to Venus, even though no human has set foot on another planet. The author also states in paragraph 5 ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not excceed Earth levels."" This also shows how the radiation of Venus is not much different than Earth's and it would not exceed higher on Venus, so a human would be safe from radiation on Venus. Sending humans to Venus is another reason why the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursiut even though it has many dangers. With many great exeptions of studying Venus and sending humans there, the author also shows the dangers of Venus. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states in paragraph 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This proves that is dangerous to travel to Venus with high tempertures that would burn a human alive. The author also states in paragraph 3 ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" This also proves that Venus has expentionally high temperatures that no human can face. These are the dangers that the author takes into consideration when sending humans to Venus. In conclusion, the author from ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After evaluating the article, the author supports the idea of studing Venus. Scinetists should study Venus because it has similarities to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there.

869,923,"Students nowadays are being more drawn to technology more than ever before. This even brought the attention of many schools to allow distance learning for students. Many students would benefit from video conferencing or online classes by allowing students who may have social anxiety or have experience bullying to take an online class, students can also learn more effectively at the comfort of their own home, and can even save time and energy for teachers and students alike Nowadays, many students suffer from some form of mental illness. In fact, 1 in 4 high school and middle school students suffer from some form of depression or anxiety. In order to combat this raging epidemic, online or video conferencing must be provided. Although some may say allowing online classes can take away from the high school experience, that however, is flawed because many people have benefited from online classes not only in grades, but in mental health. For example, my friend Generic_Name suffers from anxiety caused by recent school shootings and social interaction. She constantly over thinks every social interaction and even thinks the person she is talking to is ridiculing them when in reality, that is not the case. She eventually did take an online class at the comfort of her own home, which reduced a lot of the stress she had from school. I saw a gradual increase in her mood. If someone like her can improve, many others can as well. She was no longer afraid of her previous fears. Another example is with myself. When I was injured during a wrestling tournament, I was gone away from school to recover. I, however, wanted to continue my education so I would not be far behind when I came back. I picked up a video conference call with my teachers and was able to catch up with my classmates. I was relieved and was stress free when I came back. Schools should not only allow it, but they should motivate their students in taking online classes as an viable option. With schools becoming ever more competitive, this has put a tremendous amount of weight on not only students, but teachers as well. By allowing distance learning, much of this unneeded stress can be lifted form their shoulders. With online classes comes the ability to record a class in session, compared to not being able to record a lecture from your teacher. Although some may say students may cheat or slack off during online classes, online classes already have built in counter measures to mitigate those exact problems. For instance, I took an online class during the summer for Algebra 2. My class and I had to be all online at a certain time throughout the week. The class only lasted for an hour and thirty minutes, with small quizzes and lecture notes. I was able to ask questions and talk to my online teacher more effectively than I would have in a class in school. I came out of it with a B+ overall, and definitely learned more because of the online class. Not only that, but my teacher who was also taking care of her kids, was able to be a mother and teacher at the same time. If there was anything wrong on her end of the call, she would quickly excuse her self and give us a small break time until she resolved any issue. It was flexible and effective. Schools must encourage individuals to take online classes if they want to see improvement in their students. I think everyone has been there. The point where you decide to go into Lala land for a quick minute, only to become lost in the lecture the teacher has been giving, scrambling to find out what just happened. In online classes, teachers and students can record a lesson in any given moment. It is way more convenient for the teacher and student to record a lecture, than to restate everything that has been said. Not only that, but students can re watch, or re listen to any part of the class to get a better understanding of the subject. While some may say online classes encourages shortcuts to be made, this however is flawed due to the fact that many students prefer, and many more students end up passing online classes more than a conventional class. For example, my friend and I had to make up an assignment over Spring break. We had the option to take an online video conference call with my English teacher to be retaught the subject. My friend and I came in not wanting to do it. Since it was Spring break and I would rather play video games all day and stay outside past curfew with my friends. However, the video conference call changed the way I viewed my class and my own teacher. I was able to communicate, and even joke around my teacher making her laugh. It allowed for what I thought to be something serious, to be something fun and enjoyable. After Spring break, my friend and I became even more close, and still visit my sophomore English teacher to this day. In an age where technology is growing ever more prevalent with the old and young. The school system is systematically failing its students by creating a stigma with online classes and video conferences. There is a lot to be benefited for the youth, especially now with these options in learning. It not only solves many of the problems society faces today, but it can also bridge the gap between students and teachers. Teachers are getting out of touch with their students, but by allowing online classes, more often than not, students and teachers will grow to understand one another in a comfortable environment. Classes should not be looked at with disdain from both parties, but should be looked at with optimism and positively. In an already serious world, society should bring back the fun in learning.","A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is described by the author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"". This system enables computers to identify six of the human emotions. This technology should be used to read the emotional expresiions of students in a classroom, because it is a very valuable technology. Firstly, we should have this technology because it would help explain how people would be feeling on a certain subject, lifestyle or in everyday life. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" Since Dr. Eckman has programmed these emotions we can better understand how someone is feeling without having to ask him; each emotion inflicts a facial muscle movement which is recognised and is catagorized as an emotion. In addiotion, we should have these identifiers because it could help students learn better. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software could help someone who is easily distracted. This technology could find a way to help with this person, and the coding system could produce a lesson that this person can listen to and understand it because it was made for them. Also, the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers and staff. Some students do not show what they are feeling. If this technology can figure out facial expressions then the teachers will know who is having a bad day, the teacher could then talk to this person privately and see how they are doing. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotuions, but also may even help produce them."" Since studies show that if a student smiles they could have a better day. The teacher could recognise that someone is feeeling down so they could say a funny joke and sprout an emotion into a particualr student. In the final analysis, we should have the Facial Action Coding System in school because it will help students feel better and learn better. If a student does not want to go to school then they probably do not want to learn either. If this system can make someone's day then students would want to come to school, and teachers would then have students who want to learn. ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great article and the technology that is included in the article may be the next big thing. The first step for the coding system is to use the technology to read the emotional expression of student in classrooms. This technology can help a student throughout their school work. It can also help the teachers to teach more passionatly to students who want to learn and are not forced to come to school, but come voluntarily.","Pardon me, but i would like to disagree with you. What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural land form. The Face on Mars is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Just like we have many lanforms here on Earth, infact there is a lanform in Idaho. It is located in The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain, is what reminds me most of the Face on the planet Mars. We have more lanforms like the Face on Mars in the American West. Conspiracy theorists say that the people of NASA are hiding the evidence of life on Mars. I mean think about about it, why would we hide evidence that would benefit this whole organization? Most of the people here at NASA wish that there was an early civilization on Mars. If we did find life on Mars we would share it world wide, it would be one of the greates scientic breakthroughs in history. Do you understand what I am saying? The Face on Mars was just a Natural land form, not a monument built by aliens.","Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if you're going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it. Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas. We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. They've reached four dollars, that's insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they don't have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere. Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they can't drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but it's only helping them. Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes.    ","Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them. Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted. Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points. Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...""Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.    ","Driving While Using Cell Phone Even though cell phones where not around for a long time it has been a key factor in us daily life to which it as reaches a point where people are now using cell phone even while driving. People use their cell phone for a lot of reason and important things, things such as calling, texting, emailing and more, these activities while driving increases the driver's risk of causing an accident. doing this not only put the driver at risk but also people and other drivers around in that area. Despite the danger that cell phone causes some people argued that it is necessary to use cell phone for emergency reason. However, there are proof to show that cell phone should not be use while operating a motor vehicle. Texting is a very serious issue and people should take it very seriously. we become so interested in what we are doing on the phone and forget that were still on the road driving while on your phone increase the chance 25 times more likely to cause a crash these bad decision that we made while driving always end up in death are serious injuries. Not paying attention, and the hazards we face while driving is something we learn to avoid before getting our driver license. knowing the dangers, it might cost people still use cell phone while driving. People who work depend on cell phone like businessman, lawyers, etc. says that they all ways need to be accessible to their phone in order to keep business going and to secure client. Because of this selfishness, they put other people life's in danger. Research on google shows using of cell phone while driving is responsible for more deaths on the road. in these days we all are multitasking and it is difficult to put the phone down especially if you're on the road for a long period of time. However, it does not worth the cost of your life are someone else's. Thousands of people die every year in transportation that resolve from cell phone use according to the national highway traffic safety security agency. 81 present of us resident admit to using cell phone while driving on the road. Driving while on your phone is dangerous because it causes distraction and crashes. it required three main types of distraction such as, visual, manual, and cognitive. 'Visual' distraction is the most common distraction, this is when drivers focus and eyes are taking off the road. this is when a person now starts to pay attention on their phone and not on the road while driving. the second distraction is 'manual', this is when driers take both hands off the wheel for reason like adjusting their GPS eating and drinking etc. the third distraction is 'cognitive', this is when drivers mind isn't focusing on driving this could be cause by talking to another person while driving, are having family issues etc. drivers should consider the consequence of driver and being on their phone and make better choices for their self and others. If people don't stop using phones on the road the number of accidents will only increase more. It is Drivers responsibly to put their phone on silent and put it away out hands reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ",I think that the author supports the idea because its good to find out about a new planet when we need to move form ours. I think taking risks for mankind is good because what will happen when our would is almost gone and we need a place to stay. I think we need to explor to because it will also help with knowing things and see if there are living things there as well. I think this because lots of sientits are looking at the planet and studying it and making all the obserations that they can make from just looking at it. I feel like when we do send things to that planet we are not finging anything else i think they ned to send people to that planet but be 30 miles away so nothing happens to anyone and nobody gets hurt or dies. Despite the dangers i think it is a very good cause.,,,,,,,
195,109,"Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle. To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself. Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't. Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call. That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own. In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   ","Lots of people think the face on Mars is an alien or something else,its really not. The face on Mars is not an alien because there is no proof of it being an alien. Only few people have said it looked like an alien,but they have no proof of that being true. Lots of scientist and NASA have proof that its not an alien and that it is something else thats there. People who think that the face is an alien, they are wrong. The face on Mars is not an alien because NASA said it was a sort of rock formation. Also that it looked like a human head. NASA never said it looked like an alien or that they had proof of it being an alien. NASA said ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth"". NASA also gave proof that the shadows gave an illusion of the rock formation that it looked like a face. Another way that it did not look like a face is that MOC said it was just a landform on Mars. MOC also said that the face was not and alien and revealed what it actually was. MOC said "" MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos...anxious web sufers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". MOC had proof and a picture that the face was not an alien and that it was something diffrent. Finally, you can see that most of the scientist said it was a type of landform or something else. They never said that is was an alien. They all had proof and a picture to tell us that it was a natrual landform. The face is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a type of landform. The face on Mars is not an alien at all.  ","Do you think others thoughts are worth hearing? Would you trust someone else's opinion? These are some questions for you to think about. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and will have better thoughts on different situations. You're getting someone else's perspective. This gives another persons opinion on the situation. Another persons opinion almost always overrides your own because they are giving you a different thought in your mind and it makes you second guess your own thought. It's a reliable source to use when you are in a tight spot. A reliable source is something or someone that you can trust to be right and it helps get great information out of. This gives you better ideas on how to do things differently. Sometimes better ideas that others say is all you need because if you have a better idea on how to handle things differently you have a better solution. A different perspective is like good cop bad cop they look at things differently. You have a dependable person to talk to. Sometimes all someone needs is to be heard. Good listeners are always a good thing because they will listen to the things you say and will try to problem solve. Someone you trust and know will help you out. Almost all the time a person you can trust is the right person to talk to because you know they won't judge you and will help you clear things up. Someone you can rely on even if you are in a rough spot. A person that is reliable and you know you can depend on them for anything is always a keeper because they are the people who will help you make the right choices and will keep you on the right path. Having a dependable person is like having a conscious it will tell you right from wrong. Dozens of peoples opinions are not always reliable. However, some people might say that a lot of people are not always a reliable source. It depends on who you chose to get advice from. People who you don't trust or depend on. These are the people you should not get advice from because they are not a dependable source and you do not know if they will lead you down the wrong path. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and you will have better thoughts on different situations. People who chose to make better choices and ask others for help succeed in life more than people who don't. Better choices lead you down a successful path and asking others for advice when you think something is wrong is the first way to get there.             ","A young man named Generic_Name went to school on an online platform. He was aloud to pace himself, but he never wanted to do work, instead of using his time wisely Generic_Name would go play basketball in the park. By the time Generic_Name was eighteen he had not done his school work and could not graduate. This is what often happens to online students. Although students that go to online school have more time to work on one specific subject, students should physically go to school because it allows the student to become more social, it also allows the student to get help from teachers, and it lets them be able to go to their counselors if needed. First off, during a students high school career they will meet many new people. For example, Generic_School in Generic_City has almost 2,000 students. The students at Generic_School see new faces almost every day when they are walking down the halls. When a student takes online classes they do not get this opportunity. When students first get to high school teachers often put their students in groups and that is how students meet new people, for a student working on an online class the only time the student would get to communicate with another student would be over messaging and not face to face. Another way students get to meet people by physically going to school is by participating in sports or extracurricular activities. In conclusion, it is easier to meet people by actually attending school rather than going to online school. Secondly,sometimes students do not understand a unit that they are learning and need to ask more questions, at most schools their are after school tutoring sessions or students ask their teachers for extra help. When attending online school students do not have this luxury. For a student attending online school to get help they would have to email their teacher, who may not answer for a few days. This process may be very time consuming and may put students behind their peers. A second reason a student may want to speak with their teachers in person is teachers can be great mentors for the future and may help students decide what they want to do with life after school. Many students will console in their teachers, they will ask for advice or help with a situation. All in all, teachers are a good resource for students to have around for things such as tutoring or mentoring. Lastly, when a student attends a school their is a set of counselors to help the student with anything from schedule changes to emotional troubles. A student who attends online school does not get this privilege. Counselors are a big help to the social society in a school, if a student is getting bullied they will help the student resolve the situation. Counselors also can help students apply for college and apply for scholarships. In conclusion, counselors are a good resource that online students are missing out on. Finally, high school students should attend high school in person because it lets them expand their social skills, allows them to get tutoring options, and it lets students have access to a counseling staff. Online students should reconsider their schooling methods. Students who physically attend school will have an easier time graduating than students who go to online school or attend through video conferencing. ","There are many dangers on venus. The atmosphere of venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide, which mean there isnt alot of oxygen and we need oxygen. the clouds on venus are made up of sulfuric acid. So if it were to rain we wouldnt be able to live becuase it would be raining acid. The planet earth is a nice comfortable temperature the we are used to. The planet venus has a surface temp of 800 degress fahrenheit which would make the planet inhabitable. The temperature of venus would melt metals. The pressure there could crush whole submariens. We do need to figure out a way of getting on that planet because our planet earth is slowly diteriating and we treat it wrong The planet earth is a very comfortable planet. The ground on earth is a temperature that wouldent melt us to pieces instantly. Their is water, food, etc that can be here at earth so we can live here. their are jet planes that can fly low to the ground with no hazard but in venus you have to fly 30 miles above the ground because its to hot. Either way our curiosidy will het the best of js and start risking lives of many people to go and try to get someone on that planet. But that doesnt matter we need to make something that is heat resistant enough to be able to land on venus for exploration. This is the reason why i think that venus is a worthy but dangerous pursuit. venus is a inhabitable planet at this moment. Earth is all we have right now. We are not treating this planet right and at the rate we are doing it weill make us have to migrate to a new planet mosy likely. This is my reasoning    ","Dear (Senator of Florida), In my opinion I believe the electoral college shall not remain the same and that we should change the election to the popular vote. I believe that the electoral college and the process in which it takes for a president to get elected isn't fair. Like stated in the article if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for 'John Kerry' you would also be voting for his slate of 34 Democratic electors which would gain him 34 electoral votes. The electors could be anyone depending on what state it is and not always can voters control whom their electors vote for. Sometimes people don't know or get confused about the electors and vote for the candidate the was possibly not in their favour. A negative aspect of the Electoral college is that you can be off for about one vote or so and if the other candidate looks like it has majority they would give it to them. Sometimes they have to recount votes and check over them again because they are unsure or have new votes coming in. The worst thing is when you have a tie in the electoral college which is possible it rarely ever occured in the popular vote. In the popular vote you either win by majority or lose because you didn't have enough votes or more votes than your opponent. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that in each state the candidates on go to the states in which they believe that they have a strong amount of votes. The electoral college is agreed to be unfair, irrational, and outdated. In order for the country to continue growing and increase in the economy and so forth you don't need a president who is the most liked you need one who you believe will run the country and be able to fulfull the demands you would like for the country. Romney had most of the south votes yet Obama still won the election due to his excellence in presidency and the small states and a few large states added up together to let him win. Just becasue a president has over rule on the South states or north doesn't mean they are guaranteed to win the election. I believe in my opinion it isn't true that a large state gets more attention in a campaign than the smaller states because Obama went to small states and large states to campaign in not just the large states. Going back to Romney who went to the southern states and fairly larger states to receive majority vote. So due to the fact that there are many downsides to the electoral college I say it shall be abolished and that the popular vote from now on shall determine whether you are president or not.    ","The advantages of limited car usage is critical in source 1, Vauban, Germany a place where most of the streets are ""car-free"". In this place car ownership is allowed, but their are only about one or two places to park, which are garages at the end of each development. Limiting car usage has its advantages, the United States has up to 50 percent of greenhouse emissions in some car-intensive areas. Stores are usually placed in malls along some distant highway. The new approach made it so that stores are placed a walk away, you wont have to use more money for gas. Paris on the other hand bans driving to clear the air of pollution.

195,923,"Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. Cell Phone use should not be legal while driving because it will help prevent more accidents and also prevent more deaths. People become distracted while driving when they use cell phones and bring danger into life, the government should regulate stricter laws to citizens about cell phone use on the road. Drivers are too busy talking on cell phones and not paying attention to the road. Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. Maybe the driver gets a call, gets into an argument, or they are driving too slow. Also another reason is calling while driving can also block out hearing cause the driver is too focused on who is talking, also the driver is less aware of cars around. This has a big impact on the economy and death rates in the world. The next reason cell phone use should be illegal while driving is due to texting. This causes the same risks but at a higher rate because you are constantly looking at your phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the driver has no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities. This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions. Overall, they acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk. State governments should set stricter rules about cell phone use while driving. Death rates are going up rapidly everyday. More and more people are passing away from others not paying attention to their pathway. People are being less cautious and lose focus while being on the road. People should care about their lives and others around them more and should put their phones down until reaching the destination.

In today's world people who don't take advice seem to make terrible choices and actions. That's why taking someones advice could help you stay out of trouble and give an affect on you that makes he or she a better person. People that are giving you advice is just like an opportunity because you have a choice, listen or not. The people that don't listen are the same people that make bad decisions. On the other hand the people that do listen, learn now that the decision they were about to make could of had long lasting affects on their life. Seeking opinions can help someone make a better choice. As an example if someone was a serious beer drinker they are putting their life long affect on their body, just like someone who had a opportunity, they are like the people who don't take the advice. The long term affect it could have on you and your mind could last very long, inmates at a prison often regret their life decision. They wish they had someone tell them no or don't do it. Someone who has taken your advice could be a better person and spread your advice to other people. He or she would remember what you said for the rest of there life. This affect can result how they raise there children, what job they take when they grow older, who they become friends with, and what choices they make in everyday life. Every single one of those affects can decide their outcome as a person and they come from one source of advice. In conclusion seeking help can help in everyday life by saving people or just helping them get through the day. I hope to see tomorrows world take more advice and stop doing bad choices. I hope I would be able to walk down the street and see that there is less bad decision making and more better choices. I hope these two reasons would stick to you as great advice has stuck with me.","Briiiiiiiiing! The bell signals and the sound of shuffling papers and zipping bags begins as people pack up for their next class. The teacher bids farewell as their students trickle out the door into the busy hallway. Students chat as they meander to their next classroom. Settling down, they pull out their notebooks for their lesson. The teacher begins, interacting with them and receiving questions. While this seems like a standard snippet of a high school experience, there are many factors that would be lost if school began allowing the use of distance learning. Students should be required to attend class in person. Through distance learning, students would be unable to retain scheduled attention, and would miss out on important activities. One thing that many students struggle with is attention. However, being in a classroom environment helps students maintain focus. First of all, classrooms have a live, and trained teacher. Students are able to learn from someone that they get to know throughout the year. Interaction is easy with both the teacher, and with other students in the room. With a live teacher, the learner can ask and answer questions easily and receive personal attention concerning their individual issues with topics or assignments. This factor helps students maintain focus as they are able to quickly resolve confusion and the teacher can alert them if they begin to zone out or get distracted. Secondly, a schedule is very important in maintaining a balanced day. Having classes aligned for the week can enable students to practice time management and help them be alert for appropriate times throughout each day. To my friend, having a schedule is extremely important. Without one, she gets concerned that she will not be able to accomplish what needs to get done. To combat this fear, she creates lists, with scheduled times, that allow her align her personal schedule with her tasks. Similarly to my friend, students need to able to see what they need to learn in that day and get it done. They can work on getting to class on time, and due to breaks and meals throughout the day, they can relax knowing that their time is planned out for them. This ability is lost when students make choices as to when they feel like taking their online or video conference classes. Lastly, the school environment is made for learning. Classrooms have helpful posters and worksheets that guide students in their learning. The walls are usually soundproofed, and teachers help to prevent distractions. This setup is in direct contrast to a home environment. Also, being present in the classroom helps to prevent technology malfunctions and poor connection that could be disruptive or deteriorate the student's ability to learn. When using distance learning, students lose the ability to participate in many activities that are both crucial and embellishing to school life. For example, for science classes, participating in labs helps develop the understanding of the material and helps learners of all types, such as visual, auditory and kinetic. In other classes such as the humanities, seminars and workshops are important. These activities are inhibited when a student uses an online learning platform. Also, people think in a variety of ways. When put together, they can combine ideas and think about topics from different angles. Teachers often create group assignments to enable students to think together. This is extremely difficult to do when a student does not attend class in a classroom. Similarly, students are unable to join clubs, and are limited in their extracurricular activities, such as sports. These entertaining experiences help students unwind while doing something they enjoy. In the case of sports, exercise helps create endorphins that make a student happier and healthier. Clubs allow students to branch out in their interests and take action in issues that are important to them. I started a club which allowed me to combine my love for music and community service. This helped improve my school experience. Opportunities like these are limited when classes are taken through technology. Lastly, many school strive to have entertaining activities for students to do with friends. My school does fairs, bake-offs, karaoke, and volleyball scrimmages. We also have an entire week in which students can wear funny outfits that coincide with a theme. It is a way to spend time with friends and try something new. When a student takes classes at home, they are unable to participate in these diverse and exciting events. Some people may counter this viewpoint in many ways. For instance, students are better able to learn in their home because they are comfortable. It is true that students are able to be more comfortable at home by having a choice in what they wear, where they sit, or when they take the classes, but this is often a negative factor. Being too comfortable can be distracting and it does not benefit the learning experience. The brain tells the body that it is at home and it can cause the mind to be less focused. Also, as students attend school, they begin to become more accustomed to the environment there and it becomes more comfortable to them. Another viewpoint is that students will have fewer distractions at home. While there may not be other students there, there are pets, family, and objects that can be destructive to learning and attention. While distance learning may sound productive and helpful, in reality, it lessens the ability for students to learn. They lose the ability to get proper instruction, participate in activities, have a scheduled day, and have a necessary learning environment. As technology becomes increasingly popular, students begin to lose important connections with peers and family. To prevent this from happening in schools, students need to be present for class. To create the best learning environment for everyone, a classroom experience trumps the use of online learning.","In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author has shown how Venus is a planet that is worthy of our exploration through a few different points in this essay. However the author also uses many different examples of why Venus is/has been too dangerous for humans to venture on. But the essay does lean towards how necessary it is for humans to be curious about this journey more so than not, and they author does this using a few examples. Overall the author uses a large amount of their evidence from NASA mainly to describe certain ways they are trying to solve the problems and how they have started to already. The author does introduce the con aspect of their essay first by explaining why humans have not been able to journey onto Venus' surface yet. They start by saying, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades""(paragraph 2). This is not the most reassuring few phrases when the goal is to get humans on the surface of Venus. But by adding this in the author is placing an understanding of what the dangers are. The dangers are plainly that if a spacecraft cannot survive the surface of our neighbor planet. . .then how can a human possibly do it. So by adding in that scare factor the author then switches the tone to describes the certain parts of Venus that scientists need to get close to. Because in order to study it they need to be close enough to see it clearly. The author tells us all of the different features that are similar to Earth and because of all of these similarities scientists can learn and discover so much about our planet from Venus. The author names all of these similarities which are: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system . . . has a surface of rocky sedimet and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters""(paragraph 4). When the author says this they are leading the reader in to want to know more about what Venus is like. This is because when they say that Venus is ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" they are making the reader wonder what Venus must be like. Also making the readers curious as to what humans can learn from this planet as well. Which is a major benifit in a risk management scale. Next, the author also introduced a possible solution to the problem that is Venus' surface. They found out that NASA is doing their own research on how to land safely on Venus and to be able to withstand a longer duration of time there as well. The author said, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. . . Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus woud avoid the unfriendly groung conditions by staying up and out of their way""(paragraph 5). This is a major point because if NASA is already finding different ways that they can have ships on Venus, they are a step closer to having a ship survive on the surface as well. This is also very important because as they are discovering different materials that are lasting in Venus-like condition, and they are learning more about what could work for humans. Because if they were to create the ship that would float above the fray; then they would be able to have scientist there to observe and learn about Venus. The only problem with this is that the scientists wouldn't be able to collect samples from the surface yet. Furthermore, the author explained a few different points throughout the entire essay. Some of them consisting of cons to the situation, like how a spacecraft is unable to last longer than a few hours on the planet. But other parts of the essay were how important it is for people to go and search Earth's sister planet because of the very similar landscape that the two share. The author also added in some of the different solutions NASA is trying to decypher and perfect. For example the plan to have a ship floating over the fray so that scientists are close enough to make observations but they are just far away enough that they are unable to take samples. Over all, the author portrayed Venus as a highly worthy planet to explore and that there are many different factors as to why it is so important. ","Dear State Senator jan,28 2015 I'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states because i've been informed that when we vote for our candidate, we are actually voting for our candidate's electors. the electoral college is a process, not a place. Our founding fathers had established this in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president. as said the electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electorals are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but varys by the state laws on what their responsibility are. Presidental election are held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. we help choose our state electors when we vote for our president. most states have a ""winner takes all"" system that awards all electors the the winnig candidate. After the election, our state governor prepares a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your sate with the electors too. so when we vote for our candidiate, then we are really votiong their electors. It should be that we just vote for our candidate and that be just that. the electors do the vote for their candidate, with our votes that we put for our candidate. Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all the one the that they agree on. And its that answer i had in the begining. To be against the electoral college. They want to abolish the electoral college. But they are not alone. In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of  the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. over 60 percent would perfer the direct election. Whats with the electoral college you may ask? Voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I want to know who picks the electors in the first place? It really depends on the state who decides. One other thing about the electoral college is that they are unfair to voters. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. and voters in 25 of the largest media market didn't get to see not even a single campaign ad. So it is official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that is to be by declaring the candidiate who was givien the most popular votes the winner. There is said ti be five reasons for retaining the electoral college. 1. Certainty of Cutcome, 2. Everyone's President, 3. Swing States, 4. Big States, 5. Avoid Run-Off Elections. its an arguement that the electoral college method of selecting the president may be turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in california. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. So as you can see the reason of what i had put down, the electoral college is one that im not in favor of because it being not fair. and the fact that we are voting for the elector, not the candidates who are running for president. wish that you can see it from my point of view. Thank you for your time from: PROPER_NAME    ","there are many advantages to not having or limiting car usage for instance, In a town in germany called, ""Vaubn"" it is forbidden for a citizen to have a car if they are to live in this town. It may sound crazy but the citizens acturally like this rule. In the artical paragrah three it sates that, ""70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move in the the town"". One citizen said ""when i had a car i was always so tense  im so much happier this way"". So clearly the the reason why the citizens enjoy not having a car was maybe because, they didnt have to worry about all the expences like gas and car insurance to take care of a car. Another reason why its good to limit the use of cars is because of the nasty Co2  gas that come out of the of the muffler and polluts the air. Car pollution became so bad that the city of paris put a partial ban on driving to clear the the air of the city. By doing this the air pollution ""was down by 60"" witch the artical states in paragraph 14. This is a good  thing becase france has a higher pollution rate than other european citys. So lets get back to not having a car well not having a car for one day at least,In acity in colombia called, ""Bogta"" theres a day where nobody is aloud to use there car to help avoid traffic jams. The artical states that,""the goal was to promote alterative transortation to prevent smog"". Some citizens said, ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower the air pollution"". There  are many ways to stop air  pollution and thats why we are at an atvantage if we dont have a car or limit the use of a car.    ",,,,,,,
556,109,"Many people think that the ""Face"" is caused by aliens or it's just a natural landform. Which one of these could it be the answer to this mysterys ""Face""? Now in days most people think that everything in space that might haved popped out is made by aliens but that is not always the answer. I personally think that it's not caused by aliens but there's always going to be people out there still thinking it was created by aliens. In 1976 Viking 1 was cirleing around Mars when it took a picture in the region of Mars in Cydonia. It wasn't something that we would expect. It was very surprising, it looked like a face in the photo taken. A few days later NASA released some of the picture they took. Since than the ""Face"" became very popular it even has been in some Hollywood films. I think that the ""Face"" is caused by the natural landform. Have you ever wonder why Mars is like Earth's twin or sisters well because they are alike. Earth has had natural landform just that in Mars it looks different but it doesn't mean nothing it's still a natural landform. Now I do understand why some people might say that it looks like it has been created by aliens cause it does look like a real face. The nose, eyes and mouth litterly looks like a real face of a person but just cause of that it doesn't mean it was made by aliens. Now here is my true evidence that will convice people that the ""Face"" wasn't created by aliens. In 1976 was the first photo Viking 1 took. In 1998 another photo was taken later on in 2001 another photo was taken. If you see the pictures it is so obese that the ""Face"" on Mars is a natural landforming. In the pictures the ""Face"" looks like if it was changed over the years.","Texting and Driving The risk of texting and driving is a big risk, you take 20-35 seconds to look, type, and deliver a message while operating a vehicle going at a fast pace which could potentially hit anyone or anything under those few seconds leaving the driver and them hurt or possibly even dead. It is said that in the United States around 1 out of 10 people are killed by distracted drivers everyday because they choose to put their attention towards texting instead of focusing on the wheel. In today's society mostly everything is run off by technology and its how nowadays we communicate with one another, but there are moments when it is necessary to put down your devices and it's when you are driving a vehicle. There are many methods on preventing texting and driving and one is simply just putting your device down and not use it when behind the wheel. Another way to prevent texting and driving is using a cell phone stand which prevents you from looking down at your phone but instead having the phone next to your view of the road. If anybody else is in the car let they should wield the device while the driver is operating the vehicle and let them know if any important notifications appear. These methods just take very little time so they can prevent a risk of taking the driver's life or anybody who is at risk of being a victim of a distracted driver. It is believed to say people are more likely to die in a car crash by a distracted driver rather than a driver who is drunk or under the influence of marijuana. Even if that is to be said, there are still people that are confident enough to multi-task and risk the chances yet they don't know their reaction time is slow as an elderly due to them paying attention to several things at once which causes a commotion in the brain. Phone companies such as AT&T have tried preventing these kind of things by starting a campaign and having traffic signs say things to prevent drivers from being on their phones while driving. These acts help prevent accidents and possibly reduce accidents in the future. 1            ","Dear, principal Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME, and I have been going to SCHOOL_NAME for three years. I am writing this letter to you because you are considering on changing the school policy so the students who have a C average can not play in school sports. i do agree with you for many reasons. There are people that think they can just get a scholarship to any collage because they played sports. They need to start and realize that education is a big deal. you should be able to have a B or a higher grade to stay in sports because that's the fair thing to do. Everyone is always so worried about sports that no one has any time to do there homework and finish class work, but then there are those people that can and do have time to do that, so that's why they get a B. I hope you can understand what I am trying to say. I do agree with you and you should change it. For the people that play sports and have a C average they should start doing homework and more class work, so then can get it up to a B and then they can keep playing sports. thank you for reading my letter to you, and i hope you consider changing the school policy. Thank you for everything! Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","The sound of laughter fills the air as one girl talks about her experience as a midfielder. The other midfielders smile while the attack and defense laugh their hearts out. The lacrosse club is one of the many extracurricular activities at this school. Though you may be busy, extracurricular activities can help you make new friends, stay active, and makes you use your time wisely. Ever have trouble connecting with people? When you join a after-school activity, your group all have that one thing in common, which is a great place to start. Like in the first paragraph; maybe it's lacrosse. You can connect further by joining the subgroups. In the lacrosse club, there are 3: defense, attack, and midfield. Or say you joined the book club; you could talk about books you've read. Kinda like lacrosse, book club also has subgroups: fiction and non-fiction. All in all, extracurricular activities will help you meet more people. Staying active physically and socially is good for your mental and physical health. When you talk to others, you improve your diplomacy skills, as well as your ability to hold a conversation. After all, who wants to be lonely for the rest of their life? Exercise, as I'm sure you know, does wonderful things to the body. Such as reducing fat, raising your cardiovascular endurance, and, in general, making you feel good. Have you ever gone for a, say, 1 or 2 mile walk and felt refreshed after? It feels nice doesn't it? So get out there and have fun! However, some people may say that they don't have enough time for extracurricular activities. They have soccer practice Monday, basketball on Wednesday, lacrosse practice on Friday, and a basketball game, as well as a lacrosse game on Saturday. While that is a busy schedule, that person is forgetting about Tuesday and Thursday. What if they wanted if off? Well, think about it. Does it seem like these after-school things take up much time? Not at all! In fact, most of them only take up an hour of your day. This will also help you manage your time so you can do as much as possible within that small period. This skill will also come in handy when you are older. After-school activities are a great way to meet new people, help you get out more, and use your time to it's fullest potential. You should take advantage of the amazing opportunity you have to be more, well, out there! So the real question is, why wouldn't you join an extracurricular activity?","Eight hour school days start to become a repetitive process for a lot of people. Kids get told to go out and live while they're young, but school takes up a majority of their time. A lot of students dont want to go to school because they dont want the social interaction, or they dont enjoy it. School is important in life and they should give an alternative option for students. Students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home because they can become more independent and responsible, it gives students a chance to learn differently, and it gives kids an opportunity make a flexible schedule that will suit their needs. Being independent and responsible is important for life. When students go to school, they learn the basics like English, History, Math, and Science. While those are important, some students might not learn how to become independent and they will rely on others. Working from home or doing online school teaches them that they need to be responsible and work by themselves. It covers aspects in life where they are able to teach themselves, and they can use that down the road later in life because someone might not always be there to help them. Teachers teach in many different ways like students learn in many different ways. When teachers arent meeting the criteria for student, that can make school extremely hard and miserable. Sometimes all it takes for a student to understand what they are learning is getting extra help, but other times that isnt enough. Giving students the opportunity of working from home can give them more flexibility on how they learn. Students will have the ability to figure out what works best for them and then be able to use that and become successful in school. Students go to school on average 40 hours a week, but there are some weeks when students put in the time and they dont feel like they learned anything. School can be draining especially if its not moving at the speed the student will be successful at. When that happens some students feel like they could have been doing something more productive with their time like spending it with family and friends, or working towards a goal that they want to meet. Having the ability to work from home gives students the chance to work at their own pace and they can have a more flexible schedule so they can succeed in a lot more areas of their life that dont include school. Attending school is nothing if students arent succeeding in it. Giving students an alternative option of getting an education is important. While every student is not the same it is important that there are ways to try and cover everyone's needs. When students work from home they have the ability to become more independent and responsible, they can learn in ways that will help their needs, and give them the opportunity for a flexible schedule. When giving students the options to attend classes online or at home they now have the ability to figure out what works best for them.","I as a highschool student disagree with the idea of putting emotional facial recignition in school. Us as a society already have lost a grip on society when it comes to technology. Our youth can't even have a true conversation face to face and struggle expressing emotion or creativity due to technology growth. I think we should have less technology and teach or youth how to ask when they want something, if there bored or confused then they should express that on there own not have a machine do it for them. We should teach our youth the confidence in being able to express feelings not make it easier for our social to be wiped away with this facial recigniton. We already rely on our basic tecnology such as cellphones, and computers to get homework done, cheat, solve the most basic math equations, and as I expressed before take away our ability to be social with our peers. With this facial recignition it will most likely be avaible to most people so in that will might lose almost all social activity in the future if we keep relying on technology to do it all. Instead lets make your be proud and confident in say they don't understand, lets make them understand that theres more then a screen, more then what we type and to see what is around us. This is what i feel is best for our youth. A life without any smart technology at all.","Sometimes a person gets lost. Problems seem like they have no solution, and they fall into the constant worry of not knowing what to do or how to solve it. Being stuck can be very stressful when an issue becomes too much for just one person. However, getting advice from others is a great way to reach a solution. Talking and having multiple viewpoints have it's benefits when someone is trying to make the best choice in a difficult situation. Seeking multiple opinions can provide someone with more perspectives and other experiences to a problem, and give reassurance of the better choice. Everyone will most likely have a their own view on a problem. When getting advice, having multiple opinions and insight of others' experiences can give someone more perspective of the issue and therefore lead to a better solution. There are other times when advice from one person doesn't seem to help. Getting other viewpoints can be beneficial at that point because other people could say something more useful. For example, an adult's point of view on a situation can vary from the point of view of teenagers. Both of these can open up many options. Similarly, how someone else handles a situation may influence how another might handle it. Being aware of what solutions people have to offer can make for quicker fixes to a problem. All of these perspectives and experiences help gather more information, leaving less room to make an error. Still, there are other positive impacts that come with more opinions in addition to having options and helpful advice Support can really make all the difference. Having multiple opinions and advice will give someone reassurance of the decision they have made. Even if an issue is difficult to talk about, not sharing will only make it worse in the end. Feeling supported by more than one person makes a complicated situation more comfortable, and receiving guidance from both an adult and a friend decreases a lot of the built up stress on a person. Furthermore, the stress of having to deal with a problem alone will increase the chances of someone picking the worse option, and it can also cause more worry. Reassurance is always helpful when doubt cloud someone's mind. As a result, it will make decisions a lot easier. When a person gets stuck, and it seems as though the problem has no solution, it's better to ask multiple people for advice. It can be scary, but more perspectives, support, and knowledge of other experiences, will help someone make a better choice. All problems have solutions, but getting more opinions to reach that solution, will make everything so much better. Even though problems could be fixed with just one person, why add to the stress?",,,,,,,
556,923,"The Face on Mar couldn't been made by aliens. The monument was another natural formation. It is stated in the fourth passage, that it is giving an illusion to the shadows and making it look like it has eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Evidence say in the fifth passage say that NASA would wather hide, and say that conspiracy theorists. The monument has properties tht make it look like is has a natural human face. The shadows give it a 3D effect to look like a person from Earth. to eally see that it is not a face you will need to focuse on the picture, to not let the shadow make you think it is a face. The face is only a illusion of the mind, some people say the face looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA thinks that if there were a alien civilization on Mars that it would be a popularity increase for the big red planet. People that still think that their was life on Mars defend by saying that it would help the budget for themselves. The Face on Mars became popular and started to get on talk show, radios, and magazines. Soon NASA wanted to let the conspircy take place and leave the Face alone. The Face of Mars could have been made by alien because of the unexplainable things on Earth itself. In the last passage it states that i could have been made bye aliens. Compared to all of the things on Earth. It could be a possiblity of aliens making the Face on Mars. For example, in the last passage it says that Garvins say, ""That it slike the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on a Mars."" In conclusion, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and there for the case of the Face on Mars was a natural monument after all. It compared to West America for all of the weird thing that they have. ","Texting/Drive Should you text and drive, no you shouldn't. Texting and driving is a bad thing it can cause accidents and people might die including yourself. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. Of these, 1.6 million have a cell phone involved in them. That's the majority of all road accidents in the United States. Over half the road accidents in the States have cell phones involved, and if this doesn't make you realize just how potent it is, what will. Texting and driving should not be allowed because a lot of innocent people each year die because someone wants to be on there phone. In most states, texting while driving is considered a primary-enforcement violation, which means officers can issue citations any time they observe drivers texting and driving. Others have secondary enforcement, meaning officers can issue citations only if they've stopped drivers for some other offense. People can be charged for texting and driving such as Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. You also have Criminal charges, in some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges Class B or C. Class B misdemeanors are punished between 90-180 days in county jail. Class C misdemeanors receive the least amount of time, usually 30 days or less. Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. There are more accidents in texting and driving than all the road accidents in the U.S. each year, that's a major problem. I believe the penalty should stay the same time in jail and the fines that you'll receive. Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Time in jail, between 90-180 days in county jail. But the major part of it is if you kill another individual person in the process, which I think you should be given major charges. Fines should be over $500 up to the $10,000 range. And time in jail should be 20 years maybe more depending on how many people you killed. The conclusion to this is that Texting and driving is a major problem and we need to find ways to stop it. It's only going to get worse, because of the new technology that will be coming in the future. Even though people have habits for checking their phone they should just turn it off and focus on the road. That in all should stop the accidents in a hole, but sometimes people have import things they need to do I understand, but try to find ways to stop. You might be even saving your own life. 2            ","Dear Principal, Considering a policy change for students to achieve a grade B average before they are able to participate in school activities such as basketball, baseball ,and other activities is a ethical proposal. In most schools, children dream of becoming athletes with a colossal amount of fame, but the only obstacle they need to overcome is their poor averages in their overall classes. Children need to realize that they aren't going to get a scholarship to major athletic colleges unless they succeed in their classes. They need the education of those classes to pass major exams in their future careers. When they advance in life they will need to pass iq test ,or a drug test during their life, but they wont succeed because of their education. One kid might become the worlds most famous baseball player with a humongous amount of money and lose all that money in a instant due to the fact that he or she was scammed, robbed or, blackmailed due to the fact that he or she did not receive the proper education they were supposed to receive, because they were too caught up in sports. The message i am trying to expose in this passage, is that the principal should enforce students to receive higher grade averages to advance in their future careers.","Trudge,Trudge. Generic_Name's feet dragged on the concrete as he sighed, walking into the school. The building towered over him while casting a gloomy, gray shadow. As he entered the school, Generic_Name's so called ""friends"" ignored him and talked behind his back. He had known for a while that his friends hated him, but Generic_Name hadn't had the chance to gain better friends. The boys approached Generic_Name and start ranting about how stupid he was. This was the last straw. ""I'm done with you guys!"" Generic_Name yelled, and stormed off. ""Fine with us,"" one of his old friends said. Now friendless and depressed, Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class. ""Alright class,"" Generic_Name's teacher said while students entered the room, ""Can anyone answer this question?"" No one made a sound. Everyone stared at the teacher pointing to the equation on the board. It was so quiet, you could hear the pin drop from Generic_Name's desk. Generic_Name knew the answer, but he was scared to answer. Generic_Name's teacher sighed. She said, ""Today we will start a group project. I'll assign groups. Remember to work together."" Generic_Name moaned and expected the worst. His group ended up being consisted of students that didn't know how to work together. They ended up arguing over everything ""What happened to 'teamwork'?"" the teacher asked, startled. Generic_Name answered, ""Well if we had more opportunities to work with other people, we might know more about teamwork."" ""I better talk to the principal for more teamwork opportunities,"" Generic_Name's teacher said, shaking her head. I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make friends, increase self confidence, and develop teamwork skills. The first reason why I support the decision of students participating in extra activities is that students can make friends. If students were able to join a club/activity of their choice, they would meet other people with similar interests, leading to new friends. For example, I have participated in the Generic_School Chamber Orchestra since 6th grade, and I met one of my current best friends at this club. I also have friends I met there that are at high school right now. I got closer to these people because I joined Chamber. All of us were advanced at playing an instrument, resulting in many similarities. Students with similar interests that join the same club usually have a lot of time to spend together, resulting in a friendship because they were able to connect for so long. A whole club could learn how fun it is to be around each other and even form a new friend group. I'm sure Generic_Name could use a new friend group right now! The second reason why I support the principal's decision is that students could develop better self confidence. Some people don't try out for a sport because they are too nervous about what other people would think about them. If it was mandatory for these students to join or tryout, they could make it and see how good/talented they actually are. This results in higher confidence. A shy and low-esteemed student being part of a club and making friends could finally see how funny they are, making them happier with higher confidence. For instance, I have a friend that I dance with that had a low self confidence. She started making friends, and now she is very outgoing. Maybe if the shy girls tried out for the cheerleading team, they would join and become a preppy cheerleader stereotype. The final reason why I agree with the decision of students having to participate in at least one activity is that students would develop teamwork skills. People who play sports or participate in clubs know that teamwork is important. A basketball team that passes the ball to each other is more likely to score than a team with one person doing everything. If students were ""forced"" to join an activity, they would develop teamwork skills that would help them for group projects. It would even help them in the future for when they get a job. There are very few jobs now where teamwork isn't important because people need each other to complete a task. For example, it would be hard for a construction worker to build a whole house by himself. If the school made it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would help them with teamwork tremendously (especially Generic_Name). Bounce, bounce. Generic_Name practically skips into the school because he is so excited for Robotics. Ever since the principal made all students join an extracurricular activity, all students seemed to be happy to come to school. The building welcomed all students to a new school day. ""Hey Generic_Name!"" calls out Generic_Name's new friends. Generic_Name met them by joining Robotics. He runs to them and the whole Robotics team dives into conversation. ""I'm so glad that I have such great friends that have similar interests as me,"" Generic_Name says cheerfully. Everyone laughs as they agree to walk to Robotics together. ""Hey everyone! Can anyone answer this question?"" Generic_Name's teacher asks while the students got settled in class. Everyone's hands shot up, including Generic_Name's. The teacher called on Generic_Name and he stated the right answer. ""Correct!"" the teacher said, and Generic_Name beamed. He was proud of himself and his new self confidence. He figured out how smart and funny he was after joining Robotics. He also figured out that he was great at math, and even led his team to victory at the Robotics Championship. ""Let's work on our projects!"" the teacher said. Generic_Name's group got together and they worked diligently for the rest of class. They each joined a club or sport, so they figured out teamwork. They worked together to produce an A+ worthy project. The teacher said, ""I'm so proud that you guys figured out teamwork. The principal made a great decision!"" I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because they can make friends, gain self confidence, and develop teamwork skills.","Imagine if you could do all of your school work on your own at your own pace? You would do everything from home. Although some people say that they won't focus on their school work at home they , actually they would learn better because they would not have teachers bothering them about assignments they need to turn in. This could be very beneficial for many students who could use the extra time. For my counter argument I'm saying that they should not allow students to do online school. Doing school at home could be difficult for some students. They would have no one to help them so if they ever have question they would have to figure it out themselves. Sometimes you just need to ask a simple quick easy question but you wouldn't be able to if you are at home. Also being at home their is so many distractions you would easily lose focus on what you are doing. Another reason is that since you won't have a teacher reminding to complete your assignments you may forget about them. Being at school and having a teacher could help them do better in school. There are many benefits of doing school at home. One of the benefits is that they learn at their own pace they can spend as much as they would like on a subject. There are times when I'm in class and I understand what we are learning and I finish all my work, but I then have to sit there and wait for the other students to finish or to understand it. During that time that I wasted doing nothing I could have done my other school work. Doing your classes online is a good way to keeping up with your class because you work at your own pace, this would help you maintain the best grades possible. Another reason is that they have more time to complete their assignments. It's good because they don't have to worry about that the ""bell is going to ring"" and they are going to be late to class. They can just focus on there work without having to worry about a certain time they need to finish. Which means they can take as much time as they want, it would probably help them learn better. It's important that they do all their assignments and finish them, but it's also important that they understand the work. In conclusion this could be very beneficial for many students. This could help them to have a better future and enjoy school more. This is best for people who struggle keeping up there class who are either behind or ahead. Some students drop out because they hating sitting in a class room all day. This is a good way to encourage students to stay in school and get an education.                                                                                                                              ","The article is obviously talking about the Making of Monalisa Face. It talks too about the Facial Action Coding System. It´s a program or system that knows if you are sad, mad, happy, etc. The guys who are helping now are Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. The creator of Facial Action Coding System is Dr. Paul Eckman. The FACS can know if your sad. I need to say it is very cool. Thats how far technology is going. A computer can know your emotions. Dr. Eckman has classified six basics emotions, happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Its all about the movement of the muscles. In conclusion its not an important thing to have in this world but is kind of nice been able to see if the person in the pictur was happy or sad etc. Dr. Eckman is a really samrt men, Prof. Thomas and Prof. Nicu too. So if you want to know if your friend is sad take a picture of him. Do the process and show it to him Im sure he will be surprise. I really think this is a good idea, we can know if the presidents or old history people were happy or sad.             ","Have you ever asked for advice? I ask for advice when I don't understand something or when I need help. When I need advice I ask multiple people so I can get everyones opinion. When I get multiple peoples advice I choose one that will be best for me. What I'm trying to say is that asking for more advice can be useful. One reason why I think asking for multiple advice is good, and helpful because people could be going through rough times. People ask for advice sometimes because maybe they have family problems, and they need help so they go ask people for advice. When you need advice you don't have to ask one of your family members, you can ask a teacher you trust, your counselor, or your friends. Out of all the advice you get you can choose one advice that you think could help you the most or you can use all the advice people gave you and try them to see if the advice would help. There can be many different reasons why poeple ask for several of advice. Second reason of why I think asking for multiple advice is good. Another reason why people ask for advice is because they could be making a club, and they might not know what to do. Club members can put up posters, and ask people to write their advice or opinions on what they should do to make the club better, and more interesting. All the advice they will get is going to help them make the club better and they could get more members added to their club. When you ask for advice from people their advice can make things better. My third reason is, sometimes you are so nervous for a test so you go ask for advice from people. When you want advice for a test you can go to your teacher and ask them for advice, or you can also ask other kids that have took the test before and they can give you some good advice since they took the test already. Advice can really help you if you are nervous. When you are nervous and people are giving you some advice their advice can help you calm down. Sometimes you can also give yourself some adviceb by saying to yourself ""you got this"" or ""you are going to do good on this test"". I say that asking multiple people for advice is important. It's important because all the advice people give you can help you through out the day. Always ask people that you think can give great advice and always ask people for advice when you need some.",,,,,,,
649,109,"By limiting car uses, many great advantages arise. A few of these are the reduction of smog and air pollution, more money saved, and a healthier lifestyle. Places such as Paris and Bogota, Columbia have noticed the unhealthy amount of smog in the air so they decided to do something about it and the result was exactly what they were hoping for. In Paris, days went by with near record pullution levels which made them decide to do a partial driving ban to reduce the smog. Their intentions were to have even number starting license plates leave their cars at home the first day while the following day, odd numbered plates were to do the same thing. After the first day, the smog had reduced so much that they lifted the ban before the second day. In Bagota, it has been their third year in a row banning cars for a day (with the exception of buses and taxis.) The smog and air pollution reducion in these two places alone is massive! Not to mention the amound of money they have saved. In America, it seems that we are finally starting to cool our love affair with our vehicles. People are realizing how expensive it is to be a car owner. Source 4 shows how much the number of miles driven per person has decreased by nearly 9 percent which is equal to to where the country was in January of 1995. This realization started from when Americans could not afford new cars and the unemployed did not need them to go to work anyway. Though now that the economy has risen, we still are sticking to this money saving way. Even teenagers who are elligable for licenses and live in places where it could come in handy are not making it a priority. Instead, they are basing their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or car-pool with friends. Saving money is great, but keeping our bodies strong and healthy is even better. Because of Bogota's Day Without Cars, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took busses to work during this time. During this day when the transportation is not just sitting lazy in a car, the city's parks and sports centers seemed to have become the new hot spot. People spent the whole day exercising and getting their blood pumping instead of sitting in their car or doing othing. By limiting car usage, we almost have no other choice than to be active! Our bodies will thank us for it later. By limiting car usage, there are many advantages. Advantages such as reduction of smog and air pollution, more money saved, and a healthier lifestyle make it almost impossible to not want to join the bandwagon of reduced car use.     ","If the principle decided on if everyone had to do an activity school would be not in good shape including that there is many reasons why this shouldn't happen. People who are in school has a higher chance of not liking school than liking it. Students have more pressure doing extra activities it is just like adding more school to school. There's more reasons for which this idea is unreliable. There has been studies proven on which students don't like the facts on which school starts at 7:30 am in middle school which students have to wake up about at 6:00 for the bus so people have been thinking to start school somewhere near 10:00 or 9:00 which that also is aggravating of an idea because that would cause school to end at like 5:00. Some students do like school then they will volunteer for these activities there for students shouldn't be forced to do these activities. Doing sports takes time from doing homework which benefits your actual education. School is roughly about 6 hours and 45 minutes on which this goes for more than half the year and estimated students get 2 and a half months break. There is no time to do any activities in school so that means the activities are after school. as proven this will basically add more time to school since everyone has an activity after school. The fact that most students don't like school it should mean that the principal won't give them extra work for things they may not like even though they can choose their activity, maybe all of their favorite activities are taken so they have to find an activity they don't like. this constructs the purpose on behalf that students should not be forced to do activities.","I think drivless cars are great to our future, Having to hold onto the steering wheel while driving this car is accurate , the safety in this car should be built great if not better than a automatic car we drive everyday. This car is a serious and deadly situation , you have a car driving you around and you are not doing just about anything. This idea would benefit alot of drivers for the future , espcially older people that do not long to put there life in danger nor others. The greatest of our future is evolving with new things as in this car. It will be half the price for gas because it will only be like half a tank price as now days. Genreal motors has a made a test track and it seems to be doing great. In order for this smart car stuff to happen though we will need smarter roads to deal with instead of the roads we have today. These cars will be built and ready for your safety. The driveless cars will have a video camera mounted on the rear wheel which is safety right there. These cars will have a lot of sensors as in for safety. But today the word is all about safety just image the future as in how much safety will be a concern. For the General motors to come up with such a smart idea we should take this idea and see how great it is. This future car should stop car accidents also. Not to sure on how the car will do on ice or other probiems but im sure General motors will figure this out and get the show on the road. This invention is great and should deffinailty get you happy just thinking about it. I hope this car becomes a invention before i die , i would really love too see it and i hope you would too! ","Would it be safe to travle to Venus or what about to colect some samples of Venus like rocks,gasses or other things in Venus? Have people wounder how is Venus and is it simliller or different to Earth? We know that Venus is a planet and that Venus is closest to Earth but some poeple might not know how danger Venus has. Has any people or a ship landed on Venus or expernece how Venus feels or looks like on ground. Is it is real worth going to Venus and expercence there conditions or find any life forms in Venus? Venus Is a similler planet like Earth but only its density and size of the planet. Venus Is a Extreme planet, the conditions on Venus are bad, in Venus almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. The clouds in Venus are different, there clouds of highly corrosive sulfuir acid is in the atmosphere. On Venus the surface temperatuer avage is 800 degrees Fahreanheit acording to the artical. Those are some extreme temperatuers for a human and for a space craft to be stay in Venus. In Venus the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in Earth, humans or machines can not with stand the heat or pressure of the atmosphere. Humands cant live in these types of conditions like Venus has a person can end up dead and a machien or a ship can melt. No even a space ship or human landed on Venus in these types of conditions. Samples have not even been taken like rocks or gases because of these conditions in Venus. These types of misions can be super risky to do becasue of they extreme conditions the planet has. Earth and Venus are different, Earth has less extreme conditions than Venus dose but later on NASA is trying to find ways to see how they can have protection on there spacce ships and people to try to get some samples from Venus. This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus.","Have you ever seen an illusion where it looked like a figure, but then you realize it was just something else? Everyone has had that happen, and that is because your brain is being fooled. Recently, research shows that your brain assumes something when it looks like what you think of. For example, the pop icon, known as the ""Face of Mars,"" has fooled many scientists as NASA, making them believe that aliens were trying to give out signals. Unlike the other scientists, I believe that this ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform that looks similar to a human face. First of all, I believe that this peculiar face was made from the winds on Mars. It is true that when erosion occurs on Earth, tiny sediments of rocks are moved away from the original rock. I believe that erosion also occurs on Mars because a rock that looks like a face does not show up all of the sudden. Also, as you can see in the picture Viking 1 photographed, you can see tiny holes on the forehead of this rock. It is my opinion that this rock was eroded at some time and started to form a figure of a face. Secondly, the picture resolution of the rock was not as clear as it is today. So because of the resolution, the image looked similar to a human face. Also, at the time of 1976, scientists still believed in the theory of aliens. However, about 22 years later, the workers at NASA captured the image of the rock again, but this time they used higher resolution. Then scientists were putting it all together by finding out that this rock was not a signal coming from Martians. So because of the resolution of the picture, the sceintists assumed that the rock came from aliens. However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true. There are still many beliefs that aliens exist. For example, in 1957, there was a group of aliens coming toward a farmer. However, they left Earth and there were no other signs of aliens from then. Then there was the flying saucer in the sky in 2013. Many people assumed that it was a UFO, and there are still some research about that incident today. So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe. In conclusion, people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" still came from aliens. Some people are like me, who believe that the rock was formed from erosion and that scientists didn't have the resolution at the time to figure out that it wasn't really a human face. Overall, the rock was just a mesa on Mars.","DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE!!!! ""When your distracted who is driving""? When people that are driving get distracted they usually get distracted by a cell phone. Cell Phones often causes many accidents and they shouldn't be used on the road at all. People should be more careful and they should always have their full focus on the road at all times because one small mistake could lead to a big accident,with that being said, "" Be smart and drive on"". People shouldn't text and drive because texting and driving plays a big part in why people have accidents all the time. Teens are the ones that are most likely to text and drive . Did you know that 94 % acknowledge the dangers of texting while driving.Their were also 35% admitted to doing it,and 21% involved in a fatal car accident because of driving and texting. It has now become a law that everyone should not text and drive not only that, but your cell phone can't touch any parts of your body and you are not to touch or look at it while your under the steering wheel. If your caught driving while texting there is a 200-500$ fine you would have to pay.Although maybe in some other states texting while driving could result in criminal misdemeanor charges. You would also be in prison or jail in georgia that is of course ,if you hit someone and cause any injuries to another driver. Did you know that nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving. A new person each day has lost their lives because of the rule that people break everyday. People should always be more considerate of others and maybe even their families. Also the people that has caused the accident they are the ones who are more than likely to suffer from the people they hit,because 9 times out of 10 ,people that were texting and driving probably wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Ages 16 to 19 are three times more to get into a fatal car accident. The world would be a better place if people cared. Everyday someone live has changed or someone's life has been taken away because people don't know how to make smart decisions. People often feel like they are perfect drivers and they feel as though they will never get into any accidents and that they won't ever get caught texting while driving. In the united states today 9 people are killed on the road and more than 1,000 are distracted by their cell phones, not much has changed ever since the law stated that people can no longer text while driving. Now that it has become a law its extremely dangerous now because it makes people want to pick up their phones even more. Other places in the united states has laws against cell phones. Which means that the chances of accidents occurring while reading text are extremely high. Texting and driving is a very bad decision to make .To prevent this from happening people should put their phones on do not disturb , people should keep their phones out of reach where you can see or hear it because if you hear it your more than likely to grab your phone to check it. Last but not least make a commitment to yourself that you will not text while drive. The world would be so much better if people haven't lost their lives due to car accidents. No texting while driving could be more helpful to everyone because it could save a lot of people's lives and it could save people from going to jail.    ","Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll. He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Along his trip he got chance to visit many places. He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was. He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy. He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean. Helping on his aunt Katie's farm when he was young had prepared luke for hard work. In the story it tells you of a man named Luke Bomberger and what he did as a Seagoing Cowboy. It doesn't really try to convince you to participate in the program but if you do you can get some details from what he did to what you might do if you joined.

649,923,"Cars have been by all means the number one way of  transportation in the last decade and now people are starting to prefer walking or biking instead of driving everywhere. One of the reasons is pollution people all around the world are scared of the greenhouse effect but peole are moslty looking at the advantages in not driving If we dont drive the earth will be less polluted in the united states the number two cause in pollution is cars if we cut our driving in half we would be making our earth less polluted and more clean and also saving our ozone layer another reason that not driving isnt such a nad thing is you dont have to deal with the gas money everyone spends on there car well if you want to drive you have to put gas in it so it can go and sometimes the gas prices can be up there an if i gave my estimate i think people spend close 20,000 dollars in gas if your driving in your community of course im not talking about every person in the world just giving an estimate and that is alot of money if you save that much money in about 4 years you have your self a house or an apratment its a big difference spending all that money on gas then saving up for something you really want like a house apartment etc something else you dont have to deal with is the traffic that cars cause on the higway and sometimes in the community i know we all have been stuck in a horrible traffic jam and you cant do anything about it and we all think if only we could just walk ny everybody well the people that arnet driving and they are on the sidewalk yeah they can walk past it or they dont have to deal with the traffic jam another reason is a the accidents sometimes can be fatal to life and your checkbook and insurance now a days is through the roof another thing you have to worry about paying when your dealing with a car accidents take alot of lives every year i read a stat that every second there are  three acidents i mean i dont know if its true but if it is that is flat out scary of course you never think it will happen to you but even the best drivers crash and when it does happen either your life is in danger or checkbook is thats another thing walkers and bikers dont have to worry about crashing and either being seriously injured or coughing thousnads of dollars of expensies or damages also have to worry about keeping your car in the shop every time you need an oil change or your tires are flat or transmisson isnt working right there can be a millon problems with your car and that all cost money waling to your destantion doesnt cost a cent and if your the person that likes to save every cent why throw it away when you throwing thousands and thousands of dollars every year on something youn quite francally dont need in your life if your destnation is to walk take the bus close enough so you can walk there that way you will be saving so much money that you'l be amazed at the end of the year when you have way  more money than you had last year your going to look back and say wow i should never got a car so always keep in mind the next time you step  in your car the worries you deal with every time you drive remember ypu have to fill up or your not going any where and always going to hurt your checkbook espiacally if your car gets 10 per a gallon another thing is  the scare of the accident always looming in the dark you never know when you'll have but almost everyone is doomed to have one and those can be fatal to your body or checkbook and insureance for when it does happen is not pretty also those traffic jams are horrible and when you say aabout 50 peole all past you on the side walk and your stuck in that massive traffic jam you'll remeber this essay and say wow i should of been on that side walk and the last advantge you should know about is that while your not driving your not hurting everyones earth world air space etc your helping the earth get cleaner everytime you decide to walk instead pump up your gas tank and let off polluted gas off into the air and ulitamelty deplete the ozone i know that people will still be driving because again like i said its the number one way of transportation but the goal should be to atleast cut the driving rate in half that would help the earth in a major way and of course you would be alot richer by the end of the year so all that walking you did over the year you can rechoice over a nice vaction to the bahmamas or hawaii oe even buy yourself a nice house so you can see that dropping your car should of been a decison you did years ago and the earth will be a better place without your car driving around the streets so the next time your friend asks to come over just walk or the next time you need to just go get the groroices you can walk and one by one peole will stop driving and start helping making the earth a better cleaner safer place so you be the first one to drop driving and start walking and people will follow imsure of it and even if you have to explain the benfits so beit just know by doing those things you will acheive the goal of making the earth a better place without pollution and more ozone layer to protect from the dangerous uv light if you want a better future for your kid or grandchild its just not your earth your hurting its everybody else's including your loved ones all that money your spending buy your loved ones a gift.            ","I do not agree with the principal when he says that all students should have to do extra curricular activities, because all students should have a chance to do what they want, and not be forced to do something that they might not like to do. Some students have a sport or some thing important after school that extra curricular activities might get in the way of. Also some students might not like to do things after school. Some parents do not like when their kids do things after school and would rather tell them they have to come right home after school, because it might be in the way of a important meeting they have to go to. I think students should do extra curricular activities if they choose to, but I do not think they should be forced to do something, especially if they do not like the thing they are being forced to do. But I do think that if students are just sitting on the couch playing on their phones after school, then they should have to do something like an extra curricular activity unless they do not like it, then they should do something that they like, but if they do not like it then they should not have to do it. I also think they should add an extra curricular activity that would be more calming, like yoga or just a class on something thats calm, or on how to calm yourself in a stressful situation. i also think there should be a after school club where you can just talk or play board games or card games with your friends in the cafeteria or gym, or even in a section of the halls, if thats allowed because that would make it more likely that more students will show up after school to do things with their friends. It would also be a good way of making more friends, and to improve social skills, and help some students with stage fright if they have it, and that would help with talking in front of a big audience, so they can be more comfortable presenting bigger projects in front of bigger groups.","Driverless cars are coming to us in the near future. These cars are capable of driving themelves. For now, they still need human interaction or assistance and human skill in order to safely navigate through work zones, or around accidents. This means that the driver would have to remain alert at all times when the car is driving itself. Driverless cars can cause a lot of problems, but have some features that could really help us on the road. Driverless cars should not be further developed or put on the market because it is too unsafe to have technology do something as dangerous as driving. There are endless situations, which means that you cannot program a computer to do all of them for you. Especially when it comes to driving through a contruction site, on back roads that are not marked on a map, or up a driveway where precise steering is required. The only reason that this whole push for driverless cars was created, is because people found it too much of a chore to pay attention at all times when driving. Driving should be something that people take very seriously, which people in this day and age seem to miss. Drivers should want to drive safely, which is why the push for driverless cars makes no sense. There is no way that a computer can do everything that a human can do when it comes to driving. However, some of the features of the driverless cars could be helpful, like the cameras on the rear of the car, and on the rearview mirror to help with backing. This could come into play when using precise backing, where you need an extra set of eyes to look behind you in order to see all angles. Also, the GPS reciever would be very helpful if you were ever lost and needed assistance on directions to find your way. We should put the idea of further development of driverless cars away, and focus on some of the features that would go into a driverless car, that could better improve our cars right now. Driverless cars would just be too unsafe when it comes to the needed actions, like human skill. Drivers would not feel safe enough to drive them, and in the future when we finally get used to driving them, drivers would not pay enough attention to make the actions that actually require human skill. Driverless cars can cause a lot of problems, but have some features that could really help us on the road.   ","Venus is the second planet it also is the hottest planet which is never be touched i a spaceship since 3 decades. It is sometimes called ""Evening Star' becuase it is one on the brightest points of the light in the sky. It was often told that the planet Venus was the twin of Earth because they have the same size, they often send numerous of spaceships to Venus to see if it would work out because when they would send some it would always burn through. Venus is a thick atmosphere of almost 90% of carbon dioxide in Venus. NASA's is doing investigations on how they can gp put some spaceships on the planet without buring down, so they are using high technlogy to go check the hot planet Venus. Scientist are working on approaching to study on Venus so they can be able to let people know more information about it. Finally. Venus is a planet close to the sun, its even the hottest planet ever. Nobody wants to go to Venus because its hot and you can die by going into Venus and knowing that scientists don't want to go put a foot on the planet because they're scared they going to die or anything bad is going to happened.","You may think that the Face was created by little green men who fly around in space ships, but all that is just conspiricy. As science tells us, and from what professional scientist have researched and studied at NASA, there is no life on Mars. Whether that life form be intellegent and macroscopic (visible to the naked eye) or bactireal and microscopic (only seen with a microscope). It is obvious to tell that the Face is merely an act of nature. For example, God's Thumb, a rock formation in the desert of New Mexico. The rock formation looks the way it does from centuries of erosion from wind, water, and sand. It is likely the Face has expirienced the a congruent form of events. It is also likely that the Face is a work of volcanic activity. Mars has a rich history of volcanic activiy. Mars just happens to be the home of the largest volcano in the entire solar system. From that information, it would be of no surprise to find the Face to explode in a giant fury of smoke, ash, and lava. Although, it would be an extraordinary happening to see. Going back to the previous point made erosion, apon closer inspection, you can clearly see trenches across the Face. These may very well be from liquid water flowing on the surface, wcich recent discoveries confirms. Also, around the foot of the Face, is a large gathering of rock, dust, and other debris from probabal erosion, evidence for such thing can most likely be found right in your own back yard. Say there is a small pile of dirt or a sand box your children plays in and builds a ""mountain"" as they would call it. Then after your children come inside, it rains. when the rain stops, you go out and check to see if the area is safe to play in for your children. As you inspect the area of play, you notice small trenches and wash-out around the base of the pile of sand. With all things considered, this scientific reasoning should sway your thoughts of little green men with space ships and laser blasters.","Texting & Driving It is very hard to find someone who doesn't text or use their phone multiple times a day. Since we are so used to sending hundreds of texts a day, we don't really see how it can be dangerous. However, doing so while driving could result in your life. Not only do we put ourselves and anyone in the car at risk while we text, we also endanger the other drivers on the road as well. Almost 400,000 crashes each year involve texting and driving. Many people fail to realize just how impactful texting and driving can be. ""More than 1,000 people are injured every day due to a distracted driver,"" (Texting & Driving). DRivers think that looking away for 3 seconds to send a message is harmless, but over 1000 are injured and more than 10 of those die everyday. ""In 2015 42% of teens say they have texted while driving-and texting and driving is the leading cause of death in teens,"" (Texting & Driving). Texting and driving while being a teen is especially dangerous, do to the fact they have not had many years of practice. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year,"" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). Car crashes are inevitable, but if we didn't text while we drove over a million crashes each year could be prevented. Many dangers are presented amongst the topic of operating a vehicle while texting. However, as most of us know this, it doesn't seem to affect their actions. ""Hefty fines, License suspension, Rise in auto insurance rates, and even Prison time,"" (Texting & Driving), are some of the penalties most states have applied. Studies have shown that it is worse to texting and drive, than it is to drive drunk. So we do we do it? Why do we find it so tempting to look at our phones and text when we are behind the wheel, even if we know what it could result in? While we all use our phones every day, it may be easy to glance over, however there are ways to help decrease the amount of accidents. Many phones even have a restriction set called ""Do Not Disturb"" that you can use to hide alerts. This helps prevent you from looking at a newly received message. Looking and using a phone while driving can be very tempting. However, it is up to us to help stop over a million crashes from occurring each year. If we all stopped using our phones while driving we could not only save ourselves, but others in the car with us, and our fellow drivers on the road. Is that text really worth the cost?

It was a spontaneous change of my life! I had a great time knowing that all the work I was doing was saving lives and helping others, and it made me look at things at a whole different perspective. I still learned more about livestock, even though I am a small-town farm-boy. I learned that life isn't perfect for everyone, and that I was taking my living conditions for granted. These things have made me a better person. It moved me to see all of these people living in ruins. Tatthered clothing, rubble everywhere, mass graves, dead/injured livestock, and people were starving to death. The Seagoing Cowboys got over to Europe (and Asia) and reversed a lot of this. It came to my attention that we, Americans, are taking our lives for granted. This was a relatively easy realization to make, as things are in ruins. I am more sensitive to problems people have and now know that I'm an animal-person. I now look at things through a more ""maybe it's worse"" perspective. This has made me a better friend, better man, and more well-liked. I have made no regrets since my return. I think that once you see someone living in these conditions, you reach out to everyone a little more. If I could, I would do it again! If you try this, you will leave knowing you made a difference. The people who save lives doing this are heroic. They were brave enough to go to Europe/Asia and make a difference. I highly recommend you to take part in this program. Wars don't happen very often, after all!            ",,,,,,,
244,109,"Should we give up our cars in order to live a better life? That's the question on everyones mind right now , but it's a no brainer! Places all over the world have done this as an experiment and it seems as if they like the results. Here are a few key points from passages that will help persuade you into joining the idea of getting rid of cars. Vauban, Germany has given up their cars for a better and healther life. So many families in Vauban have given up their cars that 70 percent of them don't even own a car! The reason why Vauban did this is because they realized that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and more than triple that amount in car-intensive areas in the United States. Looking on the bright side of this since there is less space for parking stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. If you want to drive a car you can always buy a small area for $40,000 that also comes with a house where you can park the car which would have to be a hybrid. Paris did the same thing that Vauban did but in a different way. On Monday mototrist with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Of course there were people who didn't obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine; however, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The only exceptions were plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers since they didn't really affect the pollution as much as cars that use up a lot more gas. Doing this cleared the smog for some time in Paris, in fact, so much of the smog cleared that the French party was actually able to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. Instead of making a law BOGOTA, Colombia , created a program called car-free day where millions of Colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to do whatever they had to do. The goal of this program was obvious, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Violators faced $25 fines). For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event of having no cars except for taxis and busses. By Bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved of this idea and have turned uneven, pitted sidewalks into broad, smooth sidewalks. Along with the new improvements, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared. In conclusion, getting rid of cars permitly or even just for a day or a week seems like a good idea. Lots of the people mentioned above highly approve of this and say that it actually makes them a lot happier and stress free. Of course the people who don't approve of this idea are the ones who were fined for driving on a no drive zone. All in all i still recommend this idea if things in Florida start to get out of hand and we must resort to something.    ","Its a landfrom i tell you. But still people don't think it is a landfrom. Its a landfrom there is proof that it is. This eassy is going to explain that it is a landfrom i hope you change your mind and belive me on this. So what it looks like a face many things have that don't mean there is aliens. Yes, it would be cool if there were aliens but there not as far as we know there not. How many things have we thing was a face but was some thing else? For exampal there was a toy in my brother room that look like a human face in the dark but it was a pokemon. So why can't these be some thing that looks like a face. They took a lot of photos of it. But that don't mean its a face. NASA figered it out that it was a landfrom the have a very good camira. on paragrafh seven it says,""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument afther all."" See there is your proof.","Does seeking multiple opinions help you make a better choice? Seeking multiple opinions help you make a better choice because it's more helpful than asking for just one opinion, it gives you more knowledge, and you see others point of view. Seeking for multiple opinions is more helpful than seeking for just one opinion. Asking one person for their opinion wouldn't help you make a better choice. One opinion is not as much as multiple opinions. Multiple opinions have a bigger impact on your decision. The more opinions you get, changes the way you think about your decision and it helps you make the best one for you. Asking just one person for their opinion doesn't help you make a better choice but, asking multiple people does. You can be brought down by one opinion if it's negative but, if you ask for multiple opinions you can get some positive and some negative and both of them will help you decide what the right choice is. Seeking multiple opinions is better than seeking just one opinions because one persons opinion doesn't matter as much as multiple peoples opinion, multiple opinions have a bigger impact on your decision, asking for one opinion isn't as effective as asking for multiple opinions to make a better choice. You get more knowledge on the topic you are asking opinions for. More knowledge helps you make a wiser decision. If you are choosing your future career, advice/opinions will give you more knowledge on what you can chose and it will help you chose the best job for you. It changes the way you think. You hear all those opinions which tells you what people think and it could change the way you think. It helps approach a thought in a different way. When you ask for advice you are getting knowledge and it makes you approach a thought in a different way. More knowledge is important because it helps you make a wiser decision, changes the way you think, and helps approach a thought in a different way. Seeking many opinions help you see others point of view. It makes you question yourself. You keep asking yourself is this the right choice for me, which is a good thing because it helps you decide what's best for you. It helps you see how people think about your decision. You are able to see whether their opinion is something negative or positive. Others opinions make you either quit your goal or keep pushing towards it. Positive opinions will make you feel like your doing the right thing but, negative opinions will make you think your doing the wrong thing. Seeking multiple opinions is a good thing because it makes you question yourself, see the way other people think, see if your doing the right thing, and all of these make you chose the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions help you make a better choice because it's more helpful than asking for just one opinion, it gives you more knowledge, and you see others point of view. Seeking for multiple opinions is more helpful than seeking for one opinion. You get more knowledge on the topic you are asking opinions for. Seeking many opinions help you see others point of view. So do you think asking for multiple advice/opinions help you make a better choice?","To whom it may concern, I am writting this letter on behaf of my feelings on changing the election by popular vote. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy) ""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality Best regards, PROPER_NAME                                                   ","I agree that this technology is hepful, I believe it can help a lot of different people in many ways. I believe that this could be helpful because some kids/adults go through hard times and turn to death as an option. Many others may not agree with this technology because they don't want help nor do they want their emotions being able to be detected. This type of technology could help others in a various amount of ways. Here are some examples, a kid at home could be upset and the parents will never know because they don't pay attention to their childs emotions. The parents would be required to do an everyday scan so they are aware of their childs emotions. Some parents could find out how their kids really feel and get them help. This technology could keep the suicide rate from uprising. Doctors could use this in their offices to help patients. Especially infants, infants can't state how they feel. The doctor could scan the babies face and see their emotion. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" Those six emotions detectors could be very helpful. Who knows they might even come up with more emotions to detect. This could help large amounts of people. So I agree with this technology.   ","Cellphones are a big role in today society should they be used while operating your vehicle. Or should they stay in your pocket. Distracted driving has become dangerous practice on our roads and highways. If you need a reason to stop texting and driving you shouldn't be driving in the first place. first of all it illegal to do and its very dangerous you could hit another car or hit someone in the road. Some more reason are consider the people you have in the car when you text and drive you are also putting the passengers at risk when you do so. Another one is think about other people driving. you could hit a family driving home and kill all of them if you text and drive. Think about the consequences next time you think about picking up your phone while driving. Somethings you can do if a text is really that important you can pull over and then send the text. Although many cars and trucks today now have buttons on the steering wheel where you can press one button to pick up a call or to text someone back. If you drive older model cars you should maybe invest in a new car or even a more hands free phone. There are about 3,477 people who died from texting and driving back in 2015. Just be careful on what your doing while driving make sure you keep your eyes on the road at all times. Next time you go out on the road think about what could happen if you look at your phone while driving. Keep in mind that there are other peoples lives a stake when your driving distracted. Also keep in mind the people in your car when you have the urge to pick up your phone. Cites I used for this essay: https://www.napolilaw.com/article/6-reasons-shouldnt-text-drive/ https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/10-reasons-you-shouldnt-text-and-drive/ Texting and Driving Statistics in 2020 | The Zebra www.thezebra.com PROPER_NAME   ","Have you ever come home from school and been bored, because you have nothing to do? Fortunately enough for you, there are tons of extracurricular activities available. I believe that all students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The first reason I believe this, is that students are able to try a new activity and meet new people. In addition to that, students can learn teamwork and make friends from an extracurricular. Finally, students participating in an extracurricular learn how to balance school work on on top of their activity. When students try new activities, they can discover things about themselves and new people with common interests. Students may discover a talent or interest in something that they never knew they had. For example, if a person has never kicked a soccer ball, then they will not know whether they're good at it or they like it. Furthermore, even if students come to find that they don't like their extracurricular, they can still use this experience in the future. Just like when a person tries a new food, if that individual doesn't like it, then they will remember. The students can then use their knowledge to avoid what they don't like in the future. Last, it is beneficial to try a new activity, because you may meet someone you don't know who has similar interests to yours. Meeting these new people with common interests can lead to new friendships, that never would have happened. Trying a new extracurricular allows students to learn more about themselves and meet new people. Participating in group activities is very important to students. For example, teamwork can be learned by practicing and working with a team in an extracurricular. In an extracurricular it is crucial that team members trust, rely, and work with each other to achieve the common goal. Secondly, using this teamwork to collaborate and accomplish goals, can lead to new friendships. When a student learns to trust and work with a team member within a extracurricular, they can also trust and collaborate with that person outside of the extracurricular. Last but not least, being able to work in a group is a very important skill that people look for when they are hiring for jobs. Companies look for teamwork in their employees, because co-workers need to be able to collaborate and respect each other to do their jobs efficiently. Activities that schools offer teach an important lesson about teamwork, that can create new friendships and be used outside of school. Partaking in an extracurricular and school at the same time has many benefits. The first of those being, that participating in an activity and school at the same time teaches students the manage their time. Adding an extracurricular on top of schoolwork can only be done if the student learns to use all of their time wisely. This time management allows a person to do more things they love to do. If a person can be efficient and not procrastinate on things they have to do, they will have leftover time to do whatever they want. The final reason a student should attend school and do an extracurricular, is that time management is a necessary life skill that students must learn. In the future students may need to balance a family, work, and make time for themselves all at the same time. Participating in school and an extracurricular teaches students a valuable life lesson about time management, that can allow these students to do what they love. I think that all students in school must partake in at least one extracurricular. I think this, because students can get new experiences and meet new people, while trying a new activity. Not only that, activities students participate in can teach teamwork that can lead to new friendships. My last reason for believing this is that, taking part in school and extracurricular activities gives students a lesson about how to manage time wisely. I believe that all schools should require students to partake in an extracurricular.",,,,,,,

Limiting this extensive car use can benefit everyone by allowing him or her to be happy and reduce pollution. To begin, limiting reliance on vehicles may help people become happier. In Vaubun, Germany, many have sold their vehicles and are now walking or biking to their destinations. Some parents felt that when they had a car, ""[they were] always tense."" (1) Instead of allowing themselves to be outside and free to move, they were trapped inside a small space. Now, they have the freedom to enjoy scenery, without a cost. In Bogota, Colombia, people hold an annual ""car-free day"". This event bans the use of any vehicle besides public buses and taxis. (3) ""The turnout was large, despite... [the] rain showers. [The rain] hasn't stopped people from participating."" (3) This shows that the citizens of Bogota are eager to attend such an event that prevents them of using their vehicles. Many believe this event is a ""good oppurtunity to take away stress"". (3) The event forces them to take a walk or get on their bike, without the stress of gas or tune-ups. Young adults in the United States believe that [getting a driver's license is] not a priority. They organize summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation."" (4) This implies that they know walking is not as bad as it seems, and they do not need to rely on a car to get to places. Ultimately, this reduction of vehicle dependence can lead to less stress and a rise in happiness. Futhermore, reducing the usage of cars may help reduce pollution. In Paris, France, people have experienced ""near-record pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air"".(2) This experience included smog, a very dense layer of water and pollution particles. This air is very dangerous to breathe and live in. ""[In this city, sixty-seven] percent of vehicles [use diesel]."" (2) Diesel is a heavier than gasoline, and is blamed for a large percentage of pollution. The ban alternates the usage of vehicles; even-numbered plates go one day, odd-numbered the next. This process is sought to cut the usage and emission of pollutants in half. Walking, biking, using public transportation, etc. help reduce pollution because they are services given or provided to everyone. Walking and biking do not emit harmful pollutants. Buses allow people to commute along with other people, but stop anywhere you want. Using these services instead of self-owned vehicles will help reduce pollution. All in all, cars are handy for going miles and miles on end, but restricting car use to go to the store or down the street can help people become happier and reduce pollution.    ","In the text ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' There is a face, not just any face but a face that is formed over time into Mars. Some people may say that the face was created by aliens over time that lived on Mars, but their is no real proof that the face was created by one. In 1976, there was barely anything to be classified that their was even a face, even though it was forming by 1998. Three years later you can see a face clearly on Mars. Seems weird? Not really because it was later then noted a ''huge rock formation.'' The face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian a latitude where it was winter in April. Therefore, the face actually shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Landforms like that are pretty common around the American West. Facts over time has proven that it was just a landform that isolated messa about he same height as the Face on Mars. Proven with pixels, in 2001 scientist took photos and compared it to the images in 1976. Also, April 5, 1998 the (MOC) team took some pictures revelaling that is just only a natural landform. Spacecraft rolled 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view, making the image more relevent to see up close. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform created over time and is equivalent to butte or messa landforms. Also their is no real proof that aliens can really create this face on mars that took many years before forming and looking more and more like an Egyptian Pharoah formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.","Eighty- nine percent of people go to others when asking for advice because they may be unsure of others opinions, want different perspectives, or they want many different opinions. Although most know what they want , and when they want it , others dont and need an outside perspective for someone else. Advice is something that many people give and take everyday. Although when some people who just want a different perspective on things tend to ask many different people about the same advice. However that reason is everyone has different mindsets, therefore there most likely are going to be a variety of thoughts and answers. Even if one may have the best influence, some still want to be able to have others ideas and thoughts out on the table. 1 out of every 3 people will go to multiple of their peers for intake and feedback on questions or advice . There are many varieties of advice relationship advice , professional advice ,and educational advice. So when it comes down to advice that people may be unsure on they will go to others for their feedback. Although not all advice is the best advice, most advice is good. Advice is advice someone can give and get. So its important to some people who want multiple faces of advice to ask multiple people. Therapists are doctors some of the main sources of advice . Mainly because they care about their clients mental and physical health. Maybe someones boss has to give them advice . Many people give advice multiple times a day . While many people are giving advice sometimes the advice that they give has the wrong influence. Giving someone good advice can help others make good decisions for themselves . Also getting good advice can make yourself make better choices . Some dont remember that asking for help or advice is not as bad as it may seem . People think when they ask for help the are automatically weak and that is not true. Asking for advice makes people make better decisions and helps them influence the ones who look up to them . ","Dear State Senator jan,28 2015 I'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states because i've been informed that when we vote for our candidate, we are actually voting for our candidate's electors. the electoral college is a process, not a place. Our founding fathers had established this in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president. as said the electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electorals are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but varys by the state laws on what their responsibility are. Presidental election are held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. we help choose our state electors when we vote for our president. most states have a ""winner takes all"" system that awards all electors the the winnig candidate. After the election, our state governor prepares a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your sate with the electors too. so when we vote for our candidiate, then we are really votiong their electors. It should be that we just vote for our candidate and that be just that. the electors do the vote for their candidate, with our votes that we put for our candidate. Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all the one the that they agree on. And its that answer i had in the begining. To be against the electoral college. They want to abolish the electoral college. But they are not alone. In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of  the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. over 60 percent would perfer the direct election. Whats with the electoral college you may ask? Voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I want to know who picks the electors in the first place? It really depends on the state who decides. One other thing about the electoral college is that they are unfair to voters. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. and voters in 25 of the largest media market didn't get to see not even a single campaign ad. So it is official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that is to be by declaring the candidiate who was givien the most popular votes the winner. There is said ti be five reasons for retaining the electoral college. 1. Certainty of Cutcome, 2. Everyone's President, 3. Swing States, 4. Big States, 5. Avoid Run-Off Elections. its an arguement that the electoral college method of selecting the president may be turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in california. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. So as you can see the reason of what i had put down, the electoral college is one that im not in favor of because it being not fair. and the fact that we are voting for the elector, not the candidates who are running for president. wish that you can see it from my point of view. Thank you for your time from: PROPER_NAME    ","I am for the value of this technology to read students' emotions. I have a reason to support this opinion. To begin with, this could be used to ditermine the hidden human emotions. For instance, when I am having a presentation about a specefic topic, but I cannot know the audence's true feelings against me because people usually flatter and do not show their real thoughts. However, by using this technology, I can figure out if mine was good enough or not from the data. In other hand, I believe this has to be limited to protect individual human rights. For example, what if I could read emotions that are shown by folks, they would be bewildered because they have their own private feelings. This might become a big and grave issue later. As a conclusion, technology is much smarter and more intellegent, but does not have abilities to control human rights. Just because that can decearn the emotion rate, does not mean that can know the real problem beyond this technology.   ","In today's society cell phones and technology play a huge role in our lives on a daily basis. If you were to sit in a room full of people an if you were to look around at everyone you would see that almostly 95% of the room is occupied by their phone. Either searching the internet, on social media, or sending a text message to somebody but they are making use of their cell phones either way. Should drivers be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. No because people are deciding to use their phone at the wrong time. An there has been just to many deaths dealing with cell phones for ridiculous reason. We all know the feeling. you're driving and a text messages pops up on your cell phone. You have a reminder you wanna write down, and you really don't think about anything but picking up the phone. Within 5 seconds of looking at the phone , you could be halfway off the road, or already into an accident. Which may cause to injuries or even death. I just feel like whatever is on the phone, or whoever you texting is never that significant to cost somebody else life period. Many others will disagree with my opinion. But when you look deeper into it and really focus you'll understand where i'm coming from. When driving, sometimes it's really hard to keep all your focus on the road. Which leads into making it extremely easy to forget that the road is shared by others and not just for one person. For this reason all cell phones usage should be banned while driving. I found on [Teensafe, 2018] that everyday 9 people in america died from a car crash. That has something to do with texting or driving or even being on the phone, and about 3,278 people die in the past 4 years for the same reason. People are just losing their life because others want to be selfish and not think about their surrounding. Not intentionally trying to take life's but just not fully thinking out their action. Texting while driving as we all know, puts danger in many lives. A handful of youngins feels like staying attached to the outside world is way more well connected, than having all attention on the road. Altogether we just need to all stand on it to get a law passed about phone free while we are in our vehicles. In georgia has the same law it's called the hands free law. With this law being passed in atlanta georgia the accident rare, and also the death rate will decrease big time. When other states start to realise hopefully they do the same thing. Using a cellphone while driving really does put multiple people's life in danger. It's time to put all distractions aside, and focus on what's really important when it comes to driving. As we all know phones have came a long way from generation to generation, and it is interfering in many lives. It's time to stand up for the safety of your life and the people around you. It could be someone in your family in an accident, it could be you. Just by making one change in your life , it can save your life . put the phones down, it can't be more important than a life.                                ","The principal wants to enforce a rule for every student to stay after school and do at least one extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree. I think the school shouldn't enforce a rule for the students to do extracurricular activities because students may have things to do after school. Instead, the principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students who want to stay after school. I disagree with the principal's idea because students may have many things to do after school. For example, students may have to babysit their siblings, do sports, or simply have lots of homework to do when they get home. The principal enforcing a rule on the students making them do at least one activity makes it so that students don't have time to do what they need to do when they come home. The principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students that don't have out of school activities. For example, Student help, clubs, or sport related activities. That way, students don't feel like it's a mandatory extra 2 hours of school but instead, it's an optional way of taking part in school activities. In conclusion, the principal should not enforce the rule of making them stay after school because the kids may have to do out of school activties. But instead, having an option of letting students stay after school if they like to.",,,,,,,

The issue that the studenrs are going to come across is that they are not getting the help they need and they are not even smart enough. Stiudents studying at home is not something that should be allowed anywhere, although yes school is boring and there is nothing to do, but we should be blessed to have a free public school. Other places around the world parents/gardians have to pay so much money that it is just redicouls and the majority of students don't go to school because they don't have the funds for it. Home school should not be around, because the students are taking the bafit of the home and most of the home school student don't graduate or finish high school because they are too busy being home doing all the unimportant things when they should be in school getting work done and hopefully graduating. In case students do take the online schooling they should at least have someone monter them and see the progress they have done every wee or two, this way it is going to lower the mount for students that don't graduate.","OTHER_NAME SCHOOL_NAME ADDRESS_NAME March 7th, 2011 Dear Ms. Principal, Hello. Almost everyday, us students hear of a friend or a classmate that have gotten there cell phone taken away because they had it out during lunch or in-between classes. I think that students should be able to use there cell phones during lunch and other free periods because it gives the students something to look forward to after each class. Most people have cell phones now so if you keep the same rule of no cell phones allowed, you would keep pilling up more and more complaints along with a rising number of students in detention for the use of cell phones at school. I also think that students should be allowed to have there cell phones out during lunch and free periods because If the students needs to ask there parents to bring something to school for them, they cold just send a quick and easy text message instead of walking all the way to the office and signing out just to use a school phone to call home. I'm also sure that kids would be fine with turning there cell phones off during there classes as long as they got to use them during lunch and other free periods. I hope you consider changing the rule, thank you for your time. Sincerely, STUDENT","Dear State Senator, I think we should get rid of the Electorial college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the Electorial college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non- democratic method of selecting our president. It shoule be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors. Another reason why would get rid of the Electorial college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 capaign, seveteen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign. It can be argued that the Electorial College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incntive to pay attention to the campign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. Whats wrong the Electorial College? When we are under the Electorial College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for [John] kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance  that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.    ","Dear, Principal I think students should do community service because we have to keep our schools clean. We should also have community service because it will help people be cleaner by picking up after them. The community service is very important because if know one picks up the trash that's in school then our school is going to look ugly. I think you should get people to pick up every day and then for the next day get another ten people and be rotating every day. Its also necessary to help out the community because we don't want to have a dirty environment for our children and younger kids. That's why I think we should have community service most people think its not important but years later it will be important because our children are going to be the ones living with a bad environment . I think we should have community service for these reasons because if we don't clean up right now no one will clean up in the future and that will hurt us because we are going to be living in a bad environment because no one wanted to clean up . In the future we are not going to be able to smell oxygen because of the bad environment. These are all the reasons I had to say about why we should have community service. Thank you for listening to my opinions. Sincerely, Your Student","Growing up, my mother always made me and my sister complete education booklets during the summer to make sure we didn't loose all of the knowledge we gained from the prior school year. Like my mother, some schools require students to do summer projects to ensure that students continue to learn and remember what they have learned in the past. These projects are either student-designed or teacher-designed, depending on the school. Some believe that having student-designed projects is better because it gives them more freedom with their project; however, having a teacher-designed project is more beneficial. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the teacher will be able to establish a standard for the project, their will be a smaller risk of students picking information that is not beneficial or relevant to what they have learned, and it will be more challenging for the students. The assigned summer projects should be teacher-designed because the projects will set a standard for the teacher and the student. If the students could choose what they wanted to for the project, their would be an array of design and information. This can make it hard for teachers to grade projects or even see where students are at educationally. Having a teacher-designed projects allows the teacher to have a standard platform to grade from and see how the students are doing. Also, having a teacher-designed project makes it fair for all of the students. One student make work very hard all summer to obtain a great project and another might spend the night before the first day of school completing it. Having a teacher-designed project ensures that all of the students are putting in the same amount of time and effort to get a good grade. A teacher-designed project is better than a student-designed project because it allows the teachers to grade fairly and see how the students are doing so far and it also makes sure students are equally investing in the project. Moreover, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures that the information within the project is beneficial and educational to what the students has been learning. If the students have freedom to pick the project, they could pick things such as cars, food, games, and so forth. This may not seem too bad, but it is defeating the purpose of having a summer project, which is to keep the students learning. If the teachers pick the information in the porject, they can orient it so that the students will be either getting a refresher from what they learned the previous year or get a glimpse at what they will learn in the following year. Having a teacher-designed project prevents students from picking silly topics and makes sure that the information benefits the students in their learning transition between school years. Lastly, having a teacher-designed summer project is better than a student-designed summer project because it will challenge the students more. With a student-designed project, the students can make it as difficult or as easy as they wish. Some students could make their projects too easy, not allowing for any education growth; other students could make their project too hard, taking away time from their summer break. With a teacher-designed project, the teacher can ensure that the project is equal parts easy and difficult, so that the students are not wasting their whole summer but are still challenged and pushed. If the project is easy for the students, they will not learn the material to their full capacity. If the project challenges them, they will learn more and feel more accomplished when they finish it. A student-designed project may sound nice to students and parents because it is more flexible and more enjoyable for the students, but it is not more beneficial for the student's learning. Having a teacher-designed project ensures fairness by setting a standard for grading and evaluating and by students having to out in the same amount of time and effort. A teacher-designed project also allows the teacher to pick a topic or subject that is beneficial to what they have learned or will learn soon. Lastly, the teachers designing the projects allows the students to be challenged and grow in their education. A teacher designed project is all around more beneficial for students and teachers. ","I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join because you could be helping the lives of the lives of thousands of innocent people whose homes where destroyed in the wars. One of the interesting things of joining the program is that you can see a amazing sights from all around the world. It is an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Helping these people you can get the benefit of going to China and Europe and their famous landmarks. If you go to Italy there is a chance you could ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. When i was in Crete is saw an excavated castle. On your way to China you can marvel your eyes at the Panama Canal. If your not in the mood for sight seeing you can go downstairs with some of you co-workers and play some baseball,volleyball,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and Table-tennis to help pass the time while on board. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me and was vey grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of peolple in other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me for along time. It lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. If you had any job or chore working on a farm then this job will be great for you. When your on night watchman duty be careful when it rains. Because when I was on night watchman duty it was raining cats and dogs. I was climbing down a ladder when my foot slipped and I fell in my side. I nearly slid stright off the deck. But before i could fall i grabbed on to a piece of metal before i could fall off. I couldn't work for a few days because of a few cracked ribs. But if you do join just know that your co-workers are there to help you with injuries. In conclusion, I think that you should join our Seagoing Cowboy program. Not only will you be helping us by joining but you will also help innocent lives of people who were harmed in the war. ",Venus often reffered to as the Earth's twin is a close panet like Earth. It has about the same density and and size of Earth too. So Venus should be a worthy pursuit to explore. If anything ever happens to Earth the closest planets to explore and possibly populate are Mars and Venus. But there are some dangers to exploring these planets. For example on Venus a single rover has only lasted a couple of hours on the planet. So we dont know much about the planet. But that does not mean we cant explore and gain new information about the planet that mey help us out in the future. But the reason scientist and astronomers are looking more into the planet is because in paragraph 4. It states that Venus was probally a planet like Earth that had oceans and could have supported life. Another plus to explore Venus is the chance to figure out what happened to the planet. In the articel it says it used to be just like Earth in a way. So our natural assumption is to asume that our planet will end up just like Venus. But if we take some time and continue exploring the planet we might find some new information and could possiblly save all of humanity in the future. In conclusion the option to explore Venus still remains untuched but the positives and possibilities that could come out of this exploration are vast compared to the dangers it represents. ,,,,,,,
874,923,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Taking classes from home is helpful for some students. Taking classes from home make you have more time to finish. Students can gain rest when they feel tired. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will cheat, students need the teacher to explain, and student would not take it serious. First, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will cheat. For example, Generic_Name use to take classes from home when he was in high school. Generic_Name use the phone to cheat every time they gave him a test. At the end of the school Generic_Name takes SOL for the class that he use to take it in home. He fails the Sol, because he didn't understand any thing. Taking class from home will cause the students to cheat. Second, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students need the teacher to explain if they don't understand. For example, Generic_Name use to take classes that he need it to graduate from home. Generic_Name use to skip some lessons because he didn't understand it. He needs a teacher to explain it because it was hard for him to understand it. Sometimes students can't understand without teachers being with them. Some people say, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because it gave the students the opportunity to think. This point has merit because students think about things that they can't think about it when they are in school. Nowadays, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because student would not take it serious. For example, Generic_Name is lazy boy that he does not do his work in time. He use to take classes from home that he need it to graduate. Because he was a lazy boy, he use to not do it. Generic_Name does not take this class serious, so he fail the class. Last, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will cheat, students need the teacher to explain, and student would not take it serious. Students use to cheat when they attend classes from home because there is no one stop them from cheating. Teachers can explain the thing easily, so students can't find a teacher when he/she attend classes from home. Students can be more serious when they are in school. Attend classes from home is not helpful for students.                                 ","To my principal, I think policy two is the best way to go. The use of cell phones in school would be a great idea. I feel it gives the students a better advantage in their social life. It is fine to have the phones in class, but the students should not be on them while the class is going on. The use of your phone during free time seems like a wonderful idea. It gives the students something to do during the break period in school. But with this opportunity comes rules that will have to be followed, if the students wish to continue having phones. The phones are allowed but they shall remain off in your classrooms, they are not to be ringing at any point of the day. It shall remain on silent or vibrate. If theses rules can not be followed this privilege will be revoked. If you will have the students and their parent sign some type of agreement. Stating that they are aware of these guidelines, everything shall be all good. The use of cell phones would be a wonderful thing for you students. If you allow this, we will try our absolute best to follow the rules and regulations that you have set. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      ","In my opinion, I think that the Electoral College method should be abolished, because with it; the Presidential elections are quite useless. I'm specifically talking about the way Presidents get popular votes. The system is very out-dated and very irrational. When the Founding fathers founded this country, they said that the ""People of America"" get a voice and say in everything, well, not everything. But still their own say during the Presidental Elections are useless, the only real true thing to do is vote for the Senate Electors for the Presidential elections since the Electoral College proccess is mainly controlled by the Senate, the Senators vote for the Presidential canidate. You see, the only way canidates actually win the every 4 year elections in November is by the amount of votes they get, by NOT the people, but by the Senators that pleged with them during the Electoral College. In this essay I'll explain why this system is to bad for our today's world and how it can lead to false moves and corruption. First off, is what's exactly the Electoral College? It's not a place, it's more like a proccess of choosing and voting for a Presidential canidate. You see the votes that regular U.S citizens do, do not count as the actual votes, though back then the system did work; it doesn't today. Back then around the 18th and mid 19th century, this Electoral College system worked outstounding for it's time, mainly because at first America was a new country, and the Senate that did do the voting and choosing were well educated and have experience. Most citizens in the American States weren't really that educated very well, mostly for new borns since the nation just finished their revolution and they were still in debt at the time, and so not everybody was rich enough to afford anything, in turn they have no knowlege of the way the world now works. Then during the civil war, half the country became another country known as the Conferderate States of America, which opposed the ideals of a more freer nation of other half of the country, known as the United States of America. The Electoral College did help President Abe to be elected, though it was mainly because he was popular since he used the ideal of abolishing and freeing slaves to gain populraity. And alot of people opposed him to become President, but thanks to the College process; he won the Elections, and re-united the two nations into the United States of America. So, does this will in today's world? No, abosolutely not, it doesn't work, and will never work unless America gets 1984'ed and become a false and brainwashed Utopia. Due to our general corrupt society, the right President's get denied, and the corrupt and wrongful citizen gets elected. I can relate this issue with the 2000 Presidential Election crisis. In the 2000 elections, Al Gore gets the most popular votes, infact so much more then George Bush, that it was clear he can easily win the 2004 elections. But since the Electoral College is still intact, they voted for George Bush, and Bush won the elections by 5 more votes then the popular and better organized President, Al Gore. Because of this, most of America got an economy train wreck from in 2007-2008 and also wasted many resources on a the War on Terror battle from 2003, which is now gone and has a similar operation that is still on-going called Operation Enduring Freedom. Also unlike the old times when America was a new country, in today's modern 21st Century America, I can assure you that we have 95% percent of the Population educated by our today's educational standards tops. Which means that America doesn't need a hand when voting for a new President, and that shows that the Electoral College is not needed anymore, anytime. The Governments and it's people today are also very corrupt at times. This will also include the Electoral College, and can affect many lives for many people. Everybody can now make their own choice thanks to our very effective education system. So this proves the College group is now useless for voting. Finally that's why we should abolish like Bob Dole said, it can cause a lots of corruption, and was only made for it's time since at that time many people were un-educated and couldn't even read, and now a day's today's society is very well off on educated minds. And has enough corruption as it is. And so that's the nutshell of this essay, and this is why we should remove the Electoral College. As its unfair and unfit for today's world and society of the American Government.    ","Dear, Mr. Principal 2-1-11 I think students should not perform community service because it would seem like they were getting punished for something they didn't do. Doing community service would take too much time from doing school work students rely need. If students decide to clean up the community then they should be able to do it. If a student were to do something to brake the rules then they should be sentenced community service as a punishment depending on there crime. for example if a student were to start a fight the student should do a number amount of hours doing community servis. The students that chose to clean their community should be provided the tools to do the job because they don't have to do anything and some kids cant afford to do so. for example if a student needs a tool the city should provide it. I think if the student wont to do it then they should do it and get offered to get paid for it because nobody would wont to give up their free time for free. Your student, STUDENT_NAME","Is it fair to have teachers design summer projects for students on break? During school, projects are normally done throughout the course to show a student's understanding of a subject. Most schools don't assign summer projects for the student body since summer is supposed to be the break time. Some schools do give out summer projects, but keep in mind, the projects themselves, despite being assigned during break, aren't usually designed by students. Summer projects should be student-designed because people work better with ideas they're familiar with, this gives students more freedom with subjects for a project, and students are more willing to do something they want to do or research. When working on projects, its easier to work with something you're familiar with than anything else. Making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. They'd also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn't always give you enough info about a subject. Imagine trying to write a in-depth analysis on Didgeridoos when you've never even heard of one or even have background information on instruments. Familiarity with your work makes it come to you naturally and having the freedom to choose the subject of a project is important. Being able to choose what you're working with will make a project more enjoyable. Most of the time, teacher-assigned projects would have all the students doing or researching the same thing. While this makes the assignment easier to grade and gives everyone a common goal, some people want to look somewhere else. Choosing your subject could bring about interesting results and give you a new interest rather than just being given the generic science project where you monitor and grow a small plant for x amount of time. Working on something you, personally, picked out could also inspire you to put more work into the assignment. Being willing to do your work helps greatly with work ethic and attitude towards the work. Researching a subject that interests you, rather than something else, would make anyone more productive. There are lots of ideas people would look further into if prompted and this would be that prompt. Students would be able to enjoy looking up information on subjects interesting to them and put them on paper. They'd be able to turn in a well-written paper and get a good grade just for researching a fun subject. In conclusion, having students create their own summer projects would be highly beneficial towards productivity on said project. The benefits outweight the negatives and more students would work harder on these projects. Being limited to certain ideas will make it so students don't try as hard to think outside the box. This type of work also helps students find things they're interested in for later. All of these things would help them work better and earn better results, but they'd also find more information and learn better this way and isn't that the point of all this?","You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for many reasons. One reason that you should join is because it is an opportunity of a life time. Another is becasue you get to help people. A side benifit of that is that you get to see Europe and China. It will also open your eyes to be more aware of people in other countries and their needs. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get an opportunity of a lifetime. In the article Luke said that he couldn't say no on joining the program because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. You also would get to help people in need from World War ll. You would also have the benifits of seeing Europe and China. In the article he said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China......"". Last but not least it will open your eyes and make you more aware of people in other countries and their needs. At the end of the article Luke claimed that being a Seagoing Cowboy made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. In conclusion you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you will be living the opportunity of a lifetime .You will also get to help people that need help after the disasters of World War ll. It will open your eyes to the people of other countries and their needs too. As well as letting you see Europe and China, while you are working! Please consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys and help around the world.               ","The challenge of Exploring Venus The author supports the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus has the hottest surface temperature, espacially since its closer to the sun . They even had issues not having a single spaceship touch on Venus in three decades. So they didn't really had a lot of informaion, for example in the essay it says,""Each previos mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". This lets me know that if a spacecraft didnt survive imagine a human, what would happen to a human ? But we will see how things got better over time! We start of with something really interesting about Venus that it has a surface of rocky sediment and it also includes familiar features such as velleys, mountains, and craters ! I think that this fact is really cool knowing that another planet has mountains and rocks like the earth. But the author thinks that it does not have easy conditions, but survivable for humans. When time passes by we could add more things and enough to survive. Although the technology has upgraded a lot so the NASA'S think that they might have the possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Imagine them creating a vehicle hovering 30 miles or more in the landscpae. But not only that but the solar power would be plentiful, it wont be easy but they say its going to be survival enough for humans! Know we have even better technology then three decades ago, they created a simplified electronics made of silicon, which has been in Venus surface about three weeks in such good conditions. Unbelievable its been there almost about a week back then it would only last about few hours! Not only that but they also have another project just incase, you cant never go wrong with plan B. They're plan B is looking back to an old technology called ""Mechanical computers"". Since now days the devices are more delicated when it comes to extreme physical conditions. It would be so harsh the devices now days wont even make far enough as the mechanical computers. Like the author thinks ,"" Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expended to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Its never bad to try new stuff out, it might be hard at first but there's always a good ending to it! ",,,,,,,
765,109,"We have been using cell phones on a daily basis that we've gotten used to it, but people think they will be able to drive normally even if they are using their phone. Well, they are wrong, using phones while driving lead too many people in car accidents, killing other people, and you'll be fined much money, even if you don't crash or anything like that. People shouldn't be allowed to drive and use their phone for theirs and others safety. While many people think using their phone while driving isn't hard, but there have been tons of accidents because of people using their phones while driving. ""In 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers."" This shows that car accidents are now a more commonly known way people die. Usually, a car accident only involves 3 or 4 people are involved so if the number of killed and injured are so high then that shows that the number of car accidents is also high. That shows that people can't be on their phones and driving. Driving and usage of phones do cause accidents; it could also cause the driver to run over people. ""A staggering 37,461 people were killed on US roads in 2016, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous year, according to just-released statistics from the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration."" All of these accidents have occurred ever since phones came out and that's because we all think we are able to multitask. When it comes to driving we need all of our attention on it and not anywhere else because then we don't see people crossing the road. All these deaths are being cause by the fact that we can't leave our phones until we get to our destination. After many years of distracted driving the US is finally doing something about it, they instated a law that if you are caught using your phone or it's just in your lap you'll be fined. ""Motorists operating commercial vehicles who violated the distracted driving law are subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,750."" That may seem too much money for a small thing, but it could save many lives including your own. Using your phone won't only get you fined, it'll also get your license suspended, which you won't be getting back for a long time. With just one time using your phone while driving will take your money, which you worked hard to get. In conclusion, people should learn that using their phone while driving will only lead to bad things. Even if it's the first time you've used your phone while driving, you'll get the same consequences as if it was done in the past. ""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving.""

","Dear [state senator] I would have to urge you to keep the Electoral College. Without a voting system as organized as this, it would be anarchy. Some people believe that election by popular vote is better, but it is not. They believe that the Electoral College is non-democratic and outdated. But there are many reasons why it's not. The Electoral College process is in use currently, and though many people disagree with it, it would ultimately be better than popular vote. We have to put faith in the electors we vote for,  this makes it less likely any of them are crooks. When people vote for an elector, they're voting for who they hope the president will be. While that may not always be the case, it's very likely the elector will vote for that candidate. With this, we'd have to trust the elector with our votes. If we were to use the popular vote system, people could vote for candidates who run for fun, or joke. Or if a candidate decides to pursuade an overwhelming amount of people with a certain point, people will surely vote on that candidate, even if the point is invalid. This can bring the expectations for the president lower,    ","I just graduated from high school , my name is Luke Bomberger. I work two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank.

We started out with simple horses and buggies, and now we're sporting driverless cars. The future is here, and i'm super thrilled to be a part of the generation of technology. Apparently, Google has developed a car that literally drives itself! Who wants to worry about puting the car in drive, and wondering if you're driving alright...you'll always be driving great! The google cars ""have driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" which absolutely amazes me. Safety is a very important issue that I personally worry about often, but with this out of this world invention, I wouldn't ever have to worry about crashing, to an extent. Also, since these cars are basically crash proof, you'll always have a designated driver if you're unable to succesfully drive yourself home. You always hear about crazy people driving recklessly under the influence, and taking thier lives, taking others lives, and harming themselves and the well-being of innocent bistanders. With this breakthrough car, drunk driving rates would hit rock bottom. People wouldn't have to put others, and themselves in any sort of danger, because you're not the one driving, your car is. Again, safety really plays a gigantic role in these vehicles. These wonder machines also have sensors, so that if for some reason traffic is too much to handle for the smart car, the car will send a vibration through your seat to alert you to take over. To me, that's the only problem...the cars aren't fully in control. Evidence from the article states, "" Google modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" Seems like alot of sensors! I would really love to nap at the wheel, but it seems as though I would be unable to proceed in doing that. So that is something I would definetely encourage manufacures to establish...no sensors, just pure driverless cars. These cars are nothing short of amazing, and I can't wait to own one for myself one day. They are safer than your typical car, and also super cool and intereesting. So if you want more safety, and more reliablity, definelty go with the Google cars.        ","There are many people who have been through a lot in life. So it is smart to see other peoples opinons when you feel it is necesarry. The more people you talk to the more opinions you have to go off of for your choice. As you get more opinions you can narrow it down and see the different good opinions and bad opinions. I think that talking to more people for advice is a great idea. People all over the world have experienced different things. So some people might feel very strongly on your topic, in that case they would be a great person for advice. It makes them a better option than some other people. Some people in this world have barely experienced anything so they wouldn't have a strong opinion. The more advice you get the more you can narrow down your decission and be more confident with it. You may get some bad advice or opinions and you may get some good ones. But you must go through all of your advice and see which ones are good and the most supported. By talking to more people you can make a pros and cons list of opinions. That will help you see the good and the bad. Somethings just aren't worth the risk but you have to figure out what those things are. Life can be hard but that's why you ask people that you know have been through it for advice. It's your job to know if things are worth it or not. All in all, I think that asking other people for advice is a great thing to do. It can benefit you in so many ways and it could potentially save your life. But that depends on the situation you're in. But ask for advice and see where it leads you because there are a lot of people who will know more than you.","The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen. The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students because it would decrease the rate at which students learn, identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling, and it would decrease their motivation for work in the future. The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. The author states that the machines will ""recognize when the student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective intructor"" (D'Alto 6). This would be harmful to the students determination to learn. It would also cause several students to fall behind in their education. Every student experiences boredom in class, but the teacher is unable to change the lesson everytime to best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind. Students are still capable of learning material when they are bored even if it is not as effectively as when they are interested. Students need to also learn how to work through their emotions to better their ability to improve. When these students get into the work field, they can not call in sick or slack off every time they experience a negative emotion. This device would be teaching children that they should only be productive if they are intrigued by their task. This would not be a proper lesson to teach growing individiuals. The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful. The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation. The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because ""most human connection is nonverbal"" (D'Alto 6). Although that statement is true, there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. This may cause people to reply more on the machines, which would lessen the amount of human connection that exists--much like previous technology advances have done. Human connection is essential to a striving population, therefore it will have negative affect on society. The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees.","Students will definitely perform and benefit better if they attend school at home. One reason,is that the students will get to concentrate better. It would also give students more time to sleep in and wake up less tired. lastly, students getting along with teacher and students. Students being able to concentrate better at home than being at school is more assuring for their grade and learning. At school you are more likely to talk and be distracted by other students in the class, which can effect your learning capabilities. Learning in a class can be distracting sometimes when they are 30 plus students, cause of that the teacher not always able to answer your question when you need help. Teacher not being able to answer your questions results to you not understanding the material needed for the class. Learning at home is a better concentration zone for your learning environment Getting more sleep for kids to wake up feeling refreshed is essential for their working abilities. Waking up so early for students can be hard, to the point some students start having attendance issues. Not going to school makes them not to learn and slack off at school. With other students they can't focus, because they are so tired that they zone out and not listen to the teachers lesson. Students being able to wake up later to do their school work online can improve their attitude and waking up issues. Kids being able to wake up at a later time to do work improves their grade and work rate. A common problem schools have is that students tend not to like all the teachers they have. With some students they have a tendency to not do their work assigned. At times teachers have a habit of treating other different, so not everyone gets the right treatment. Student being able to do their own work they don't gotta worry who they get along, which leads to getting good grades and staying on task. I believe doing school work at home benefits students in a positive way that helps them grow as a student. Also, making their learning life more easy but efficient as the same time. Their learning abilities improve as there isn't anything that can distract or make you feel inferior to everyone else.     ",,,,,,,
765,923,"Distracted drivers Drivers today are stuck outside of reality. Due to the massive increase in technology everywhere most drivers are not looking at the road. The use of phones on the road is a hazard to everyone even near the deadly driver. How many mor lives must we have to lose before giving more than a ticket is the only punishment. To continue, the number of deaths that are done by a car is insurmountable. Distracted drivers are the main concern for pedestrians crossing the road. Approximately four thousand people were killed in the year 2015 due to drivers not looking at the road. Having a phone in the car with you is very important but only for emergencies. Now phones are used to text, play music on their phone,make phone calls,etc. Using a phone while driving is a safety hazard and should be punishable by a huge fine or even imprisonment. Vehicular homicide is a real thing and affects thousands of Americans each year. According to the department of transportation in 2018 3,477 died due to texting on the road. Furthermore. the people being hit are not the only ones in danger when drivers use cell phones on the road. Drivers are killed because of their own negligence. On many occasions distracted drivers will hit trees,buildings,homes,etc. When drivers hit massive objects they cause more problems than expected. Drivers who use cell phones while driving can create thousands of dollars worth of damage,and could possibly ruin small businesses. All of this can be averted if only people stop putting their cell phone as a first priority. Let's stop trying to multitask. Any conversation worth risking our lives for is one not worth taking/ Thirdly, let's think about the children. Children lose everything when someone they lose is gone. Distracted drivers are a growing breed and majority of them are on cell phones. When a driver hits a woman with their car a full sequence of events follow that. Not only is that woman and the potential she could have on the world is gone,but the family that she left behind will never be the same. Drivers who use their cell phones on the road causes a complete domino effect that will possibly lead to much pain. In conclusion, drivers who use cell phones are a plague on american lives. Every conversation is not worth having especially if you are driving. Lets stop the cycle end cell phones while driving.            ","The people want what the people want. My idea is supported towards popular vote due to how unfair Electoral college really seems. My claim is that, popular voting is more fair, most liked and the people get what they want. I believe that the idea of a popular vote to elect the president is a way better idea than Electoral College. In Electoral college your vote actually goes to the electors of the canidates, and they get to elect the president. So in a way people don't really get who they vote for. "" When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors "", proof there to tell you the president you want is not really who you're voting for. "" Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election like we have now "" direct evidence that shows more people want a direct vote so they arn't being lied to, get worried or even angry. The winner-take-all system really had an effect on the people in the past due the way some states could never see the candidates so they knew that they had no chance of winning. Now Electoral College may be unfair and outdated but some people still support it and like the ways of it. The Electoral College is considered an anachronism, or just not fit best for the present time. Basically each party selects electors and then they vote for that party's nominee. The winner-take-all method is really what the Electoral college is all about, what is does is gets voters in toss up states to pay close attention to the campaign and on average are the most thoughtful voters and on average usually decide who will win the election. The Electoral College usually balences the voting considering large states gets more attention from presidential campaigns then a small state would ""... restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states  lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution "". Although some people want a political reference rather then one single vote deciding on who the winner of the election is. In conclusion I agree more on the side of a popular vote rather than the Electoral College. It just has a more fair advantage and it supports my claim, popular voting is more fair, most supported and just overall better for the time being. The people want what the people want.     ","Why others should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

If so, were you actually driving or was this car a driverless car? Many people are preferring to ride in driverless cars or semi driverless cars. Without your eyes on the road, how can driverless cars be safe? The Author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" gives examples of how driverless cars can result in being late, more expensive, and more acciddents. In the story "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph three, states many companies that have started making these driverless cars. One being General Motors, whose idea was towards ""Smart Roads"". Having smart roads would be rediculous becuase of the expensises in using magnets and the special car sensor needed. If we had smart raods, and the road broke, what would we do? Basing all of our driving on a ""Smart Road"" would increase the risk of it breaking and everyone being late. Okay, so smart raods are a terrible idea. What about smart cars? Google came out with a Toyota Prius. The prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a roatating senor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Sounds cool right? There are a couple problems with all of this stuff on a car. The first problem being that if one thing broke it would be super expensive. the second problem being if one thing broke nobodywould be able to drive at all. The last problem with all of the gudgets on the car is having the extra weight on the car would make the gas milage go through the roof. So, smart roads and smart cars are starting to sound like a bad idea. Still can not make up your mind? Take the human mind as a consideration. These smart cars would make humans lazy. If we had these driverless cars we would not pay any attention to whats going on on the road. In the story ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph eight reads "" some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. Think about what would happen if a car had a malfunction, would the other riders in the driverless cars be paying attention? Think about if a kid ran in the street after thier ball, would the car or the driver know? Finally, think about how much boring the world would be if you only rode in the car not drove it? Would you see the the beautiful blue sky or the amazing adventure of the forest? No, you wpould not. The little things are what make driving such a privledge not a right. In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. As people, we should always look ahead at what is in front of us. In ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author states both good and bad ideas of the driverless cars, I encourge you to think about the little things and the bad thing, on why we should not allow driverless cars.       ",Some people think it is important to get more than one idea when trying to come up with something. So I am going to list the pros and cons to that. Do you think that getting more than one idea is important. One pro is that you get lots of other ideas from asking people. So for example if you ask 15 people to help you with making a decision then you have many other ideas. You can also use all of the information they gave you to make one bigger idea. And they you can all get together and all come up with one idea. But the con to that is that you have a bigger decision to make. For example if you get 15 different peoples ideas and there nothing alike your going to have to decide whos ideas gets thrown out. If some ideas are just bad then that make that easy but most of the ideas are probably going to be pretty good. So your just sat there with most likely around 12 or 13 ideas and you dont know whos to pick. But the second pro is that all the time doctors use this strategy to narrow down a sickness/injury someone has. And most the time it works out and they get rid of a view possibility. And when they do use this it lets them find it out faster and get to work right away sometimes it just takes five minutes and they get the idea and its right and they save them. For example one time my brother was in the hospital and they didnt know what was wrong with him but thought shearing ideas they found out what was wrong with him. But the con to that is sometimes that just throws them off. For example one time there was just someone at the hospital normal and doctors are trying to find out whats wrong but because they disagreed so much they got in a argument. Another example is that one doctor might think its the flu and the other could think its the corona virus and they might start screaming at each other. Or a final example is that they think is two different things and instead of getting mad trying to prove there point they just sit there confused. I think that sometimes shearing ideas with others can help but other times it cant. If its something personal then just keep it to your self. But if its like what the doctors do then you should ask for help. And if someone ask you for help then dont be rude you probably should help them out and make there day better.,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students. When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk. The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students. As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students. Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom. ","Some students need alternatives for learning and schools should be liable to provide them. Whether it's a class or just school in general, students should have options based on whichever way they learn the best. Some students just want to take online so they can use their resources while doing their work, others like it because it's the environment they are able to learn in the most efficiently in. In my opinion, it doesn't matter what reason they have to take the class. All that matters is the student is getting a better grade and learning more than the environment he or she was in. Of course they're people who need to be in a different environment because of medical or mental reasons; But this doesn't mean we shouldn't provide it for those who are struggling in a classroom environment. Honestly I find this prompt ironic because this year is the first time i've taken an online class and i've been asked, ""isn't that for kids with special needs?"" ,and I find myself saying exactly what I wrote in the first paragraph! Since I am taking an online class I can safely say that it has helped me. The reason I took my class online (History) is because the classroom I was in was very hectic. I am in honors and that is one of the only honors classes I am taking so I didn't want the reason for me dropping out of honors to be my teacher/class, and that's when I thought about online class. Instead of dropping the class I was able to still take honors online and my grade went from a C to an A. On top of that, I have more fun being in this class so it makes me wanna learn. I truly believe that I can learn more in a week of online class than I would a year of History with Generic_Name. It's not that he's a bad teacher, once again, it's just that environment isn't for me. I believe that schools should feel obligated to provide an alternative for student's education. In my opinion, the evidence speaks for itself. Would you rather spend a year wasting your time in a class that you might fail because it isn't the way you learn, or would you rather spend 8 months in a class that you'll have fun in and retain the information for the rest of your life? Duh, the one you'll do bad in.(sarcasm) Schools already provide alternatives for a lot of kids, but mostly for people who need it (medical reasons). But that doesn't mean the students who are struggling in ordinary environments don't ""need"" it too. I didn't know how to indent so I used spaces.",,,,,,,
135,220,"Dear principal, I believe that allowing student to bring phones to school and using them during lunch period and free time but as long as the phones are off during class time is a bad idea because what if the student don't listen to the policy and they have there phones out during classes and there texting during there class and when the teacher ask what is the answer to ""2836/847 they don't the answer how they be able to learn. Here's an example I think I can bring my phone to school and text, call, go on the internet go on facebook do what ever i want do and if it goes to far. That student will start to fail school and not doing the homework. That student will start going to classes. Then start skip school her so cool and popular. I also believe don't allow student to have phone at school at all is another bad idea because what if student needs to call home call someone else what if a group of student are walking to school and someone got shot how would they call the police if there phones are at home that student will be dyeing right before the other students eye what would you do. So here's policy 3 the student are allow to bring they phones to school but at all time it has to be turned off and in your locker inside your book bag. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument. Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn. Also, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with other students that they can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that they'll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students. On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way, they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home. In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.         ",The students at SCHOOL_NAME would like you to change the grade policy from B to c' s .Because most of the athletes here are going to games and have practice after school so its hard for them to do there homework because they get home and their tired from running around for a few hours. Then on top of that they have to wary about their game .And that's why the students here think that you should change it from a B' s to c' so that the athletes aren't working so hard. That's why the students think you should change it from a B to a C so that we don't have to work all the time to keep up with grades and sport at the same time .That's what the students have to say about changing it from a B to C thank you for your time and we want u to thank really hard about this.,"Dear Principle, I know that you have been contemplating on whether or not it should be a requirement for the students of our school to perform community services. I think it would be in your best interest to read the letter i have taken the time to type for you. I believe that community service should be a completely voluntary thing. But i do think that you should initiate a school wide punishment for those caught littering on campus. I know that my opinion might not really matter to you, and i am sure that the school board is already discussing what to do, but please hear me out. I believe that most kids don't want to do volunteer work or community service because it doesn't appeal to their interest. But i do believe that if you were to schedule field trips where we were able to go to a national park or something of the sort, students would be more enthusiastic about helping to clean the environment. I hope you will take the time to read over my letter and take it into consideration. If you do not, i will understand. But if you do use the things that i have mentioned, i would like to receive full credit for the inspiration of my ideas. Because i believe in giving credit, where credit is due. I hope you come to a decision soon. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Venus is one of the two closest planets to earth. Scientists would very much like to travel to Venus and even poissibly take samples from there, but there are a lot of dangers. Despite all the dangers Venus is still very much like Earth, and even though Venus would be very challenging to travel to it is still very much possible. Venus was most likely the planet to be very much like Earth a very long time ago, but even today Venus has some features that are the same as Earth's. For example, in paragraph 4, the text states,""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment an includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus may not completely be like Earth, but it has vey similar features. Scientist already know about some of these features, but there are probably a lot more similarities between the two planets. Traveling to Venus would be very challenging and even possibly life risking, but scientists are sure there is a way. NASA's idea is to hover over the fray with a blimp like vehicle, but there are still risks. In paragraph 5, the author says,"" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" The temperature in the blimp like vehicle would still be very uncomfortable for the passenegers, but the last sentence in paragraph 5 says, "" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" Traveling to Venus would be an amazing thing for the people in NASA. There are many different risks, but so much would come ouf of traveling there. Having risks should not stop scientist from being able to experiment with different planets, especially one so close to home. As it says at the end of paragraph 8,""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""","Cars have become a part of everyday life over the years. We depend on them for transportation from one place to the next. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live without a car? Well, globally, changes are being made. There have been car bans and even a community that completely quit using cars. There are advantages of limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can lead to a less stressful life. The residents of Vauban, Germany, have taken a huge step. They have given up their cars. As stated in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. A statement from a local resident, also found in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". The limit on car usage has allowed the residents to go back to a simpler life. A life where everyday noises such as children playing and bicycle wheels rolling along the pavement can be heard. Limiting car usage impacts the environment greatly in a positive way. The article titled ""The End of Car Culture"" states, ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions, just behind power plants"". Cars are a leading cause of air pollution around the world. For example, the smog in Paris, France, had gotten so bad that they had to put a temporary partial ban on driving. Due to this rule, congestion was down 60 percent. Cutting back on the usage of cars would have an incredicle impact on global air pollution. A simple step in the right direction can change the environment is a positive way. Being happier and decreasing air pollution are only two advantages of limiting car usage. There is a lot that can come from taking cars out of our daily routines. It may be hard to adjust at first but the impact it would have on the earth would be worth it. Taking responsibility and care of our earth is a change that needs to happen. It is a possible and reasonable solution to our pollution problem.

135,563,"Dear Principal; I think Policy 1 is the better one out of the two because communication in school is important. Telling people about relationships is always a big deal in school. So instead of the class being the place for talk, why not free time or lunch. It would cut the chatter during class and would let teachers get out the information to the whole class without any distractions. Since lots of people have the same classes they can tell their friends what is happening in that class, so they can be ready for it. Also to tell them about projects or tests that are happening in that class. Sports are another big thing that require communication. Not just to fellow teammates but to parents as well. Say if a practice is cancelled or a game gets moved up a day early how will you be able to contact your parents. Emails may not get read until the next day, and if all the team calls on the office or nurse's phone then that will interrupt class time. Instead of all that chaos they can just call their parents on their phones or send them a text. So if you haven't been able to figure it out yet, Policy 1 is a much better choice than Policy 2. Also the students will be happier with the principal for allowing them to use their phones at all. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      ","Some schools have begun to offer distance learning as an alternative for students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing. I feel that many students would benefit from a distance learning course because it allows them to learn in a private and comfortable setting, the students would have more time to complete their assignments, and it would allow them to do the work on a more flexible schedule. First, students would be able to work from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. In doing so many students would have less distractions, due to the fact that there would be very few people to keep them from focusing on their work. They also would not have to worry about being judged for what they wear to their classes because there would be no one to comment on what they are wearing. They could also do the work wherever they feel comfortable, if they really felt like it they could lay in bed and work. Second, students would be given more time to complete their assignments. With them being given more time to work on the assignments the deadlines, for the assignments, would be even better. Students would not be restrained by a bell schedule to complete their work. And if they have any questions they could talk to their teacher directly rather than having to wait for the teacher to finish with another student. Third, the schedule for the students would be a lot more flexible than having to go to specific classes at specific times. Students wouldn't have a specific time they are required to be attending their classes. They are able to work on the assignments whenever they have time to. And they can leave the assignment and come back to it at another time, rather than being required to finish one assignment to move onto another. In conclusion, I feel that schools making distance learning available to all students would help benefit the ability of each and every student because it would allow students who want a more private work environment to do so in the comfort of their own home while also giving the students more time and a more flexible schedule.","The students may have trouble with work at home so their grades might be a little low, but if we had more time to work on it in class and we had it explained to us clearly we might understand it more. I think the school policy should not be changed to we have to have a B grade average to play sports most kids have trouble once in a while, but we just need more help then we get now. Students just need to be passing to play sports and have fun another way to get kids to work better, and harder is to reward them with a game or a treat. If kids don't get to play sports or games they might not work even hard enough to get a c' s it would be d' s and f' s if the students get privileges they will work harder. What the school could do is set up events for all the students to do for a limited amount of time a day like 30 minuets before lunch. The teachers can just take more time on each lesson to make sure every one knows what to do. Events can be used as an activity and a free time thing to do, but if students decide to play sports Instead of have the activity they can get a few friends and go play the sport of their choosing. It will be good to use to get students attention and to buckle down in school, and do their work so they can get rewarded. If they have work for a class they can go into their teachers class to get their work done and then they should be able to go play if they did not get in trouble all week. every student deserves one chance to improve on there grades and to stay out of trouble. even the good kids mess up sometimes so all the students need to get a second chance.","Dear principal, I think its not fair to students that don't want to do community service should be forced too. It should be a choice not something we have to do. Some students like helping out and being kind others do not want to waste their time helping or be responsible that is on them not on you. It would be different if the students were making a mess and trashing the school on purpose then they should do community service but some kids are busy or do not have the time to help out. Some kids do it because they have nothing better to do. I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't like to be forced to do something you really don't want to do. please just think about it. For the kids that do community service should get a little something from you or the school it doesn't have to be anything expensive just a thanks or a pencil or something to show the you appreciate their kindness. You can ask students to help out with things or show others how to do something. You will have more students help out if they are asked but if they are forced most wouldn't bother doing it. Ask any student for help no matter if they say yes or no it doesn't hurt to ask someone for their help. Or you can put papers on the schools boards about things that are needed to be helped with. Put it places where students can see it. Its easier that way if you are very busy to ask students around the school just put the papers up and wait for students to show up to your office ether asking where to go or they just might find out by themselves and do what they were asked to do. Who knows if the trouble makers might want to help out and do good. I don't recommend you to make this official yet ask other students what do they think about this and ask if it would be better to have it by choice. Have some teachers ask students in the start of class or the end. You will see when a teacher asks a student for help the student helps them but if the student is being yelled at or forced to the student will fight back, with words, and argue with the staff.","In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the article, the author state that Venus has dangerous conditions for human life to explore. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Even though Venus has harsh conditions, there are still interesting facts about the planet that astronomers want to look more into. ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" In Paragraph 7 the author explains how sceintist are trying to make other approaches to studying Venus. ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Even though Venus is dangerous, this pushes scientist to innovate more to make their exploration successful and it will be effective on other planet explorations.","Countries like France, Columbia, Germany and USA have took part in reducing greenhouse gasses by reducing if not excluding vehicle transportation. Stats have shown less amounts of carbon in the air and less congestion in imense cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia. Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing even-numbered license plates to drive one day and have the odd-numbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to even-numbered plates the following day. Anyone against that restriction would be given a 22-euro fine or 31 dollar fine. That method decreased smog and congestion by 60 percent. Source three talks about the country of Bogota, Columbia. This town or city has took a big step into reducing gas emisions where not only they participate but other local towns and cities as well. They contribute by leaving their cars home all day for one day to reduce the amount of carbon and smog in the air which helps the enviroment. People hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. violaters faced a 25 dollar fine. Not only does this benifit the environment but it helps people conversate more with each other. "" it's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. As it is said in source one, "" As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The small suburb town of Vauban, Germany is home to 5,500 residents were its perimeter is just a rectangular square mile. It is seperated away from all city life where people get around by walking to nearby stores. It may be the most advanced expirement in low-car suburban life. Developed countries or developing countries should think about all the gasses that go into the air and damage the surroundings and take part in to reduce the harmful greenhouse gasses.                                              ","Self driving cars are becoming more and more popular as techology advances making it feel like one day in the future we're gonna just ditch the cars all together and we're all going to be hovering around on hover boreds and there wont be a reason for people to learn to drive. Realizing this makes people wonder if there will one day not be a purpose for a drivers license because techniacally they won't be driving. But with everyone just wanting to be in with the new things in the world no one ever thinks about some of the dangers self driving cars could cause. One danger people should be extremly aware of is the independance on the vehicle. When people hear the phrase Self Driving Cars they think about something completely different and more advanced than what driverless cars actually are. They instantly assume that they have a free ride to where they want to go and can be oblvious of there surroundings when thats not the case at all. What if there is a malfuction and they have to be ready to take the wheel to keep from drving into a ditch and they arn't. As stated in the article it says ""..the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation comes."" this means that even though people are not driving doesn't mean they can sit on their phone text and expect there not to be any problems because they can't be so dependant on a machine. Another problem there is with getting the driverless car on the road is the laws that need to be passed to allow them. only three state have allowed them to begin driving on the roads which are ""California,Nevada and Florida"" but even those states keep them on minimum useage for acident prevention. As stated in the article ""..even if traffic law change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" which means that there would be conflicts between owners and manufacturers to see who would be responsible if there were accidents caused by malfuctions. Now there is a diiference between self driving and autopilot. with autopilot people still understand this as you have to be cautious if though they arn't driving they still have to steer. As stated ""Tesla has projected a 2016 reaease for a capable of drivihng atuopilot 90 percent of the time"" this says that even though it's not self drving you can still drive with little to no driving at all. Even though it would be cool to have a self drivng car people still need to put safety of themselves and others before buying a driverless car.",,,,,,,
135,901,dear TEACHER_NAME we think we all should be allowed to bring your phone to school and use them during a lunch periods but as long as the phone is off or we should be able to use the phone to because it might be an emergency for us too. you just never know when something could appear to happen. and the teachers should do the same thing so it would be the same amount and it would be fair to both of us to students and teachers. so we wont be bored either for example if we are done with an assignment or maybe we should do are work at the same time while we are using are phone. and plus middle school students like to chat with their friends and every body likes to text the most cause middle school students think that we are adults now and we should be trusted to use are phone in middle school all the time. because we are almost there to being an adult. but for now we are young adults. we should be starting to be using are phone so we can get ready for high school. so that way we will become smart and we will really become into real adults.,"By the age of 3, parents send their tots to pre-school, a place for kids to experience and learn outside of their homes. These small children learn to listen, behave, and, most importantly, socialize with other kids their age. With these social abilities, the kids are sent to kindergarden, a slightly bigger classroom in order for greater socialization and assimilation. What follows is middle school, then the largest, high school. However, with the rise of technology, an increase in a game-changing kind of education has been popularized: Online schooling. At an alarming rate, students have turned to this alternative in order to remain in the comfort of their own home. This comfort only goes so far; at what point does comfort turn into isolation? Through a screen, kids cannot nearly reach the needed amount of socialization and experience that regular, out-of-the-house schooling provides. Students would not benefit from the ability to take classes online as it hinders not only their social abilities, but also future job performance. Students who attend school on a daily basis learn the basic social skills necessary for a job. Whether it's relationships with co-wrokers or bosses, these types of social skills help one keep up their career, something in which their livlihood depends on. Schooling provides knowledge on how to treat a boss. For example, in the memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, Angelou claims that she skipped school in order to provide labor to her family business. When she got her first job as a housemaid at the age of 14, she had never experienced the discipline of a real teacher, a problem that also comes with online schooling. A few days into the job, Angelou broke numerous plates in spite of her ""unfair"" boss, but failed to realize the repercussions that would follow. If Angelou had attended real schooling, it's evident that she would be familiar with punishments that come with misbehaving, and likey would not have been fired. For online school, without a true disciplinary figure, kids could become just as naive as Angelou in the workplace. Outside-of-the-house school also teaches young adults about the social importance of punctuality. For example, for three years I've been the pianist for the school jazz band. Arriving to school at 7:30am every Wednesday is draining, however I've learned that if I'm late, I will get in trouble by not only my band director, but I will have also have let down all my band-mates. This has taught me to always be punctual to my hostessing job at a local resteraunt, knowing that if I fail to show up, I will have let down my co-workers. Such activites, that require punctuality, are not a factor of online schooling. Since punctuality is a necessary aspect of a job, students need to learn the trials and tribulations of punctuality in order to refrain from minimizing their good relations with co-workers and bosses in order to keep their jobs. Online school will not provide students with proper skills in forming regular friendships. Healthy marriage, family, and peer relationships all are the product of how we learned to get along with others in the schooling days of our adolesance. For example, in the novel Into the Wild by John Krakauer, outdoorsman Chris McCandless, from Annadale, VA, attended public school all the way until high school. Throughout his jounrney into the midwest, he credits all his friendships made along to journey to the ones that he made in Annadale. Always a social man, unlike other outdoorsman, McCandless learned to form bonds, for example the lifelong bond with elderly man Franz, in which they remained friends throughout the his journey. At resturaunts and bars across the west coast, workers claimed that McCandless had outstanding charisma compared to other wanderers. Other outdoorsmen who travel the west typically don't have the same social skills as they've been isolated from the world their whole lives. To compare it to online schooling, kids most likely will not gain the skills to form lifelong friendships if they are in isolation from the outside world, just like a typical outdoorsman. Also, with online schooling, students may have a harder time with future girlfriend/boyfriend relationships later in life as they've been isolated from their own age group for the majority of adolesance. My grandmother, being an only child and homeschooled living in the rural part of Louisiana, told me about the trials and tribulations of her finding my grandfather. Because she was so isolated from her own age group, she wasn't sure of how to properly act around men her age. Fifteen years of being an adult landed her next to my grandfather, but it was only after a long, hard single life that she was able to keep down the right one. Online school would have kids delaying their relationships due to lack of social interaction around peers their age, making it difficlult to find a solid relationship. Others may disagree and claim that the online schooling resources, such as skype, will provide students with the social interaction they need outside of their own families. While skyping does provide some interaction, learning through a screen will never provide students with the same student-teacher bond that is necessary for building mentor-type relationships in the future. More importantly, with only a teacher, where is the peer interaction? Kids learn content most efficiently when interacting with other peers on a daiy basis. For instance, in AP chemistry, notably one of the hardest classes my school has to offer, the teacher assigns group work every day after learning a new subject. When I work on the content with my peers, they provide me with easier shortcuts and alternatives than what my teacher taught. With Skype, no peers are present to help a student with a touchy subject. There is just the teacher, and only what's in that teacher's brain can be offered to the student.            ","Dear Principle, You should not change the grade average for students to participate in sports form a C average to a B average. For example, if a student is trying his/her hardest the should not be punished for not getting a subject. Also if a C average is considered passing the class then are you going to change average to pass to passing to a B also. That to me tell student you are doing well or good in school but you not doing so good to play sports. Now if the student had D average and they needed a C average they should not be able to play sports they have not put it all in to there grades. A B average is saying that I am trying hard to get good grades. So why would you punish a child who has a good over all grade and keep them from playing sports. In all there class they might have all A and might have one C which would take there grade average to a B. but what if this child go all A and might have gotten a C in one class and a B in another that would take there Grade average even lower so the don't get a subject or they do bad on some test. should you let something so small as not under standing something in class stop them from playing sports. we are all humans you cant tell me you understood everything you learned in school. Why should something as small as that keep them from playing the sport they love.","To: principle I think it is a great idea to help the community, because there are some people that don't even care about the earth as much some other people. also i think that when you are eating lunch you should clean up around yourself. also when you don't have anything to do you should help pick up things and you can throw it where it should be thrown in and that is the trash. After you do what you are supposed to do you can do that every day and that is how you will help our community. Also when you have helped you should go to other places and if you see trash on the floor pick it up even if its not your's. Another thing is when people throw things on the floor tell them to pick it up and if they don t pick it up for them. and also you can help the community by telling your friends and maybe they would help you clean up litter and that way you wont be the only one helping you can be the first person to start and also you can feel really good that you aren't only helping yourself you are helping others. and there will be a large amount of people helping the community. And you can start your own little group by you going on television and telling the people to start helping our community so that way we are not the only people helping it could travel out threw all of the earth and there will be a bigger difference.","Acording to the text it's basicly talking about venus and how it's closer to the earth nd how venus is actually a planet. While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examin more closely. And it says that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. In space terms humans have sent mumerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. I think that Venus is the most populer planet that every one talks about and it seams that is is the closest planet to the sun. Venus and Mars our other planetary neighbor that are closer to the sun. NASA is a big company that works with other company to get more information about earth. NASA is working on other approcaches to studying Venus, carbide have been tested in a chaber simulater to see if it would bring eany effect. Lerning about Venus had helped me a lot and to know more about earth and about the sun and uther planets around Venus. Our travels on earth and beyound should not be limited by dangers and dounts but should be expand to meet the very edges of imaginatoin. Another thing is that you shold never stop dreming and never stop biliving in your self and enything is posibel if you put your mind to it.   ","Cars are manufactured. They were designed to be put on this earth and be used by responsible drivers. Having no cars as a safeguarded transportable vehicle is like having your dices tossed on the dirt and you can't predict what you have. It's not define as smart decisions, this is considered by opinions. Individuals have dissimilar opinions on driving, whether it is dangerous to get behind the wheel or that it should be outlawed. Most can agree with the Mobile World Congress in the executive chairman, Bill Ford. His proper approach is to plan a business plan for a world that consider personal vehicle ownership is undesirable so they can put down emissions so it can improve safety. I don't buy it. Rejecting car culture is certainly the dumbest alternative decisions that anyone has to make. To provide reasonings to my strong point, brings me back to paragraph 36. It clearly states in bolded writing: ''With all these changes, people who stopped cars commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit....'' Furthermore, the demographic shifts in the driving population have strong trend that I can agree with. When you are fifteen, you can partake on the written and reading portion of driving and as you study your way to reach your goal, you get your permit. As you ascend your way into the online session and the real world test, you'll find yourself receiving a license as your ticket of permission to be behind the wheel by the law and by the state. Car ownership turnmoil is documented and caputred by the state due to it's nonfundamental implications that's truly not beneficial to those who rely on taking responsiblity for their actions. But if the decrease in measures that can be jotted down on paper proves that you have overestimated your duties and perogative that will not be catergorically denied before a state court or driving school. Once you lose your vehicle, it's not about banning the driving, this is about how to teach the driver on how can he or she be better the next time. Taking away driving privileges and sorts of public transportation will ease it's way to find itself in a world where nothing will be run by anyone.         ","In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it talks about the development of cars that can drive themselves. The article talks about hoe companies are working on cars who can completely drive on their own with no human assistance. I am against the development of these cars. I am against it because how can you have a car that needs no human assitance, I think it would be a safety issue, and laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. How can you have a car that needs no human assistance at all? Even the smart cars that we have today still need human assistance. Firstly, the cars tha we have today still have to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. The smart cars can't not navigate through traffic such as, work zones and accidents. Secondly, in the article it says, "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" I agree with that, who would? The whole point of having a driverless car is to not have to drive and manufacturers are no where clsoe to that kind of car. Lastly, the cars that we have developed now can only accelerate, steer, and brake themselves. The cars now have ways to notify the human when the road ahead requires human skills. The manufacturers are not close to developing a car that can drive itself because as of right now all of them stil need a lot of human assistance. They can't really do much by themselves. I think that driverless cars would be a big safety issue. I do not think that a computer is as alret as a human. In the article it talks baout how driverless cars are a big safty concern. Firstly, what would happen if there was an accident and the computer was the one driving? Would it be thr drivers fault or the computers? Secondly, if something ever went wrong and there was an accident and someone was hurt who is at fault? is the driver or the manufacturer at fault? Lastly, what if the computer is controlling the car and it doesn't see something because it isn't as alert as a human? If the computer hit soemthing would the human's insurance cover it? This is why i think driverless cars would be a safety issue. Laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Firstly, in the article it says that lawmakers have agreed that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. This means that they think safety is achieved when human drivers are the ones driving and not a computer. Secondly, some states are already against driverless cars and no one has even onvented one yet. In California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia it is illegal to even test drive computer driven cars. Lastly, in the article it says that presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This means that the laws are based on human drivers are more alert and safer than a computer. This shows why I am against the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars need human assistance, they are a safety issue, and laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers and pedestrians safe.  ",,,,,,,
135,923,"dear principle, If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy i think the best idea is to choose policy one. Policy one is the better choice to pick, not only is it more favored by the rest of the students, but it gives the students responsibility. Also policy two is a bad choice, not giving the students the right to have their cell phones is wrong when almost all of them has one. A rule like this is easy to break and many students will get into trouble. If you make it a rule that students can not have their cell phones at all, the students will bring them anyway and if they are already breaking a rule by just having them, most of them will break more of the rules and start using the cell phones. Policy two, i think, is a horrible choice. Policy one however, is an excellent choice. Students will be happy that they can have their cell phones and be able to use them in the time given.","In my opinion this idea that have distance learning from home have good benefit and also have unbenefit Think that this progranm can be only for people that can not go to the school . One benefit is that people can learn in home. Also can be benefit for the people that have desirability. Unbenefit is that maybe they can not learn to much. This program can be helfull for everyone that do not go the school for any reason. First this can be benefit for people that work in the night .Some student do not go to the schools because they do not want to get up early. Also for that reason student do not have great attendence in the schools .Student that are in this potition have this oportunity to enjoy to this manner to learn. Student that can not go the school if they want to have better education can be in this learning in home program because it is the best oportunity. Second, people that have desirability also can be helfull because for they are hart to transport. They can have more spesific type of learn they maybe can have more time to learn. But maybe they do not like or they do not understand the class but the teacher that they have online ca explain more to them . They need to have special type of learning . For exemplo More time , explain easy . Third unbenefit is that maybe they can not learn to much. They will not have to much help from the teacher because if they teach online they will put spesific time to teach. If the student do not understand the leason that it is not problems for the teacher they do not care or they do not have time to explain. Student some time they think that take online classes are bored . They do not care about that In conclusion everyone have the oportunity to have education in different manner. Some students can go to the schools but others not .For the student that can not go to the schools this is better way to have education. Something they will learn if they want they will do because never said I can not do this before try because if you want you can do .Learning online wil be helfull for some but not for everyone. work hart is better to do anything  ","Dear Principal, If my principal is considering to change the policy that students have to have a B grade average or above I would go to a school that didn't have that policy but had a policy that I would like. I don't think that's fare for just students that got a C average grade and that can't play sports. If they are passing the grade to go to the next grade why can they not play sports if that are passing with a D or above that average. I would write a letter to the principal and tell him not to do that or I will tell all my friends at this school that we will miss with you until you get tied of being miss with. I would have a fit about the school policy that the principal was changing about you must have a B grade average to play sports. I think he should change the policy you must have a C grade average to play any kind of sports. If C is a average grade why want you lit them play there sport at what they are good at so when they get to collage they would know some moves and learn how to play good ever more. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principal, Many students like to perform community service because it very important to the community. Some students think it takes up too much of there time. I think students should perform community service even if it does take up there time because its helping the community, doesn't take your time away, and its something you need or want to do. First of all, its Helping the community. Its helping the community by clean up the earth because you don't want the planet to be all filled with trash. Your community needs to stay nice and fresh. Also you you want your community air to stay fresh and now reek of pollution. Second of all, It doesn't take your time away. Most students just go home, do homework, play video games, and do chores. When they don't know that most of the other students are out helping in neighbor hood by cleaning up. Well you think that may take up your time but its not. Your actually helping your community, not wasting time. Lastly, Its something you need are want to do. Helping keep your community clean may be something you want to do . It can be like a job of some sort. Are maybe its something you need to do like the rest of the students at your school. In Conclusion, students should help the community. Help the community because its not a waste of time, who knows you could get payed for it because its cleaning up the community. So help out for you, your community, your school, and your family.","In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it was talking about Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

They are trying to land a spaceship on Venus its been three decades that a spaceship has landed on Venus. Its becoues the on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. They are studying Venus becoues long ago Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. Venus has rocky sediment and includes familier features such as valleys, mountains,and craters. NASA is trying to send men up to Venus to studying it but they are trying to bulid something that hovers over Venus and they can studyng it. NASA is working on other approaches to studyng Venus. Venus is a planet to know about becoues that might be the next planet we might be living on. I think its a good thing to study on Venus becoues its a planet that might be closes to ours.","Most people rely on vehicles for every day aarons. We use them to go to the store, beach, mall, everywhere, but don't people think there may be consequences? Limiting this extensive car use can benefit everyone by allowing him or her to be happy and reduce pollution. To begin, limiting reliance on vehicles may help people become happier. In Vaubun, Germany, many have sold their vehicles and are now walking or biking to their destinations. Some parents felt that when they had a car, ""[they were] always tense."" (1) Instead of allowing themselves to be outside and free to move, they were trapped inside a small space. Now, they have the freedom to enjoy scenery, without a cost. In Bogota, Colombia, people hold an annual ""car-free day"". This event bans the use of any vehicle besides public buses and taxis. (3) ""The turnout was large, despite... [the] rain showers. [The rain] hasn't stopped people from participating."" (3) This shows that the citizens of Bogota are eager to attend such an event that prevents them of using their vehicles. Many believe this event is a ""good oppurtunity to take away stress"". (3) The event forces them to take a walk or get on their bike, without the stress of gas or tune-ups. Young adults in the United States believe that [getting a driver's license is] not a priority. They organize summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation."" (4) This implies that they know walking is not as bad as it seems, and they do not need to rely on a car to get to places. Ultimately, this reduction of vehicle dependence can lead to less stress and a rise in happiness. Futhermore, reducing the usage of cars may help reduce pollution. In Paris, France, people have experienced ""near-record pollution. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air"".(2) This experience included smog, a very dense layer of water and pollution particles. This air is very dangerous to breathe and live in. ""[In this city, sixty-seven] percent of vehicles [use diesel]."" (2) Diesel is a heavier than gasoline, and is blamed for a large percentage of pollution. The ban alternates the usage of vehicles; even-numbered plates go one day, odd-numbered the next. This process is sought to cut the usage and emission of pollutants in half. Walking, biking, using public transportation, etc. help reduce pollution because they are services given or provided to everyone. Walking and biking do not emit harmful pollutants. Buses allow people to commute along with other people, but stop anywhere you want. Using these services instead of self-owned vehicles will help reduce pollution. All in all, cars are handy for going miles and miles on end, but restricting car use to go to the store or down the street can help people become happier and reduce pollution.    ","What do you think about when you think of the future? Do you think that driveless cars would be the end result of being safe? Driveless cars are not safe because it makes people lazy, gets rid of all driving laws, and technology isn't always as great as we think it is. The world is already lazy, so why would you want to make it more lazy? We already have machines, computers, and phones doing everything for us. Machines make everyday things but people get paid so much for pressing a button. Computers do everything for us. Phones answer all our questions. Now cars are going to be driving themselves. And what are the people going to do? Sit back and watch. Then all we will be doing is having everything do it for us and we do nothing. Not only will the people be lazy, then there will not be laws like there is today. What is someone gets hurt? Who are you going to blame it on? People do what they do and how they do it for a reason. If people want to drunk drive and drive high then they should be punished for the bad things they do and not have a car doing everything for them and be as if it's a way out of trouble. Now that there isn't much laws and we have robots doing everything for us there is only one thing we depend on. That is technology. Technology isn't the greatest. Have you ever got mad while being on a computer or a phone? Why is that? It's because technology didn't work as well that day. What are you going to do when you're in a driveless car and it decides to just stop? You're going to get hurt. Now you're hurt and no one is reliable because we thought technology was the greatest thing. All in all, driveless cars are not safe for today's society. They are not safe because it makes people lazy, laws will be cut in half, and technology doesn't always work. We're here to make something of our lives and not have technology do everything for us. So go out and have a life.          ",,,,,,,
129,220,"I believe that the Face is just a natural landform on Mars because no one has any reall proof that it is made by aliens and the astronauts might have just gotten lucky and taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place. I think that there is no proof that aliens made it because even NASA said that is was just, ""A huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,"" I believe that this quote means that not even NASA thinks that the Face was formed by aliens they just believe that it was just shadows on the rock. Another example from the text that makes me believe that it wasn't made by aliens is that, ""People think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,"" I believe this supports the claim that there is no proof of aliens because if there was then NASA would have already put in the papers so that could get money to go and explore Mars but, since they haven't put out any information about Mars obviously they haven't found anything to prove that there is life on Mars. The second reason I believe that it was not aliens who made the face is because the astronauts might have just taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place. I believe this because the text states that, ""What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West,"" I believe this piece of evidence supports the claim because it proves that the shadows were only causing an illusion there was not eyes, or nose, or mouth they were only shadows that were in the right place. The second piece of evidence that I believe supports my claim is, "" Scientists figured it was just another mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh,"" I believe this supports my because even the scientists believe that it was only shadows that made it look like the rock had eyes, nose, and a mouth. In conclusion, I believe that the Face is not made by aliens because there is no proof it is made by aliens and the astronauts might have just taken the picture while the shadow made the rock look like a face. ",Dear principal I think you should let us kids bring our phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times because what else do we have to do we talk to our friends at lunch anyway plus it would be a lot quieter in the lunch room and if there turned off in class you would not have to worry about us using them anyway. Plus if we where to use them in class the teachers would take them from us and turn it in to you then our parents would have to come get it and we would be band from bringing it to school for the rest of the year that would work to i am positive that it would. Even if you do not make that a policy we will text during lunch and class anyway so either way where still texting it's a wining situation for us that is but not so much for you a very good time to let us text would be in the morning during tag because we don't do anything in tag anyway except for Tuesday Wednesday and Thursdays. But still we have Monday and Friday to text in tag but we should get to text during lunch everyday because all we do is eat and talk anyways and that's my final decision to the policy.,"dear principal, How do you think the students would feel about your decision? i think different about this. my reasons for this are first what if a student is doing there work but always have a c but it is a high something like a 79 and they really want to be one the basket ball team but they cant. my second reason is what if they do have a b average but is one point away from a c would you allow them to be on a team. last but not least my third reason is what if they have meet the standard and is allowed on the basketball team but while they are on there grades start to drop. would they be able to still be on the team. If a student is doing his/her work all the time but they some how always end up with a very high c could they be on the team. i remember back at my old school i wanted to be on the team for my school but i couldn't because i had an c. its not because of us students that our grades are low yes we understand that sometime it is but you have to think a bout it, would you want to be in the same place as us. Lets say a student has a b average and is able to be on the team but there b average id very low and is close to c would you still allow them on the team. we all now school comes before an activity but we work very hard to pass so that we can move on to the next grade. what if you seen our grade have showed allot of improved over the past few weeks would you allow a basketball team then? If you had a student on the basketball team and they love basket very much but you see there grades are starting tot drop very much. what would you do. lets say i am a student and i am attending your school you see that my grades a above an b average and you see i can also lay very well at basket ball or and other sport. when i get on the team my grades start to go down to a b, and as i keep playing they keep dropping until i' m at a low c well i get put off the team or would you give me time to pull the grade up. you see there are many reasons why i think not being able to play sports until you are at least at a b ravage is a bad choice. you see that we are tring to do better at our work we are focused and always prepare","Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle. To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself. Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't. Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call. That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own. In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   ","In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke was a cowboy rode the waves. he helped people in Europe after War World 2. Luke went to Europe to help people that didn't have shelter, food or animals. When Luke just graduated highschool his friend Don asked him if he wanted to go to Europe. Luke knew he couldn't pass this opportunity of a lifetime up.44 Nations joined together to form UNRRA [ther United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaton Administration.] ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cowes, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."" Luke wanted to help people if he didn't go he wouldn't like to help people. 'Luke did get some free time when he was on the boat he got to see Venice, Italy he also toured an excavated castle in Crete and mareled at the Panama China"" he got to see many things many people don't get the chance to ever see. It was an aventure for him. ""it took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china"" It was hard work to keep ever animal safe and alive on the long journey and animals could have died of sickness and cancer and a lot of other thing like not getting any excercie. "" Heping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for dangers at sea. On Lukes second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job awas to cheack on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captian, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's haert raced as he shot feet firt toward an opening on the side of the ship. a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overborad into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive. But he couyld not work for a coulpe of days because of vraked ribs."" He was really happy to be alive and he was ok with craked ribs because he was alive. Reasons that people like Luke became or are going to be a Seagoing Cowboy is because they like to help people in need that need food a shelter. They don't just do it to go to Europe and see everything and to have fun, they do it because they care about other people. ","The innovations in the field of facial recognition and analysis have expanded beyond just identifying someone based on a picture. Now, computers with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can identify human emotions from facial expressions. This innovation would be a valuable asset if used in a classroom environment due to it making it easier on teachers and helping student actually understand and learn the material. One reason this technology would be valuable in the classroom is the aid it would provide to teachers. FACS can recognize when students are confused or bored by analyzing their facial expressions and each ""action unit,"" which is movement of one or more facial muscles. No teacher can always recognize when a student is zoned out or confused, which is why employing FACS to do it for the teachers would be extremely valuable. One of the primary developers of the technology, Dr. Huang, says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" By recognizing boredom or confusion and notifying the teacher, FACS helps teachers be able to recognize when their lesson is not being effectively heard by their students. FACS also changes the lesson plan when it recognizes that a student is bored or confused, which helps the teacher keep the class engaged and allows them to participate more. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to the help it would give teachers by enhancing their lesson. Another reason FACS would be valuable in the classroom is that it would tremendously help students actually understand what they are learning. Students do not always understand what they are being taught, and even though they might not understand they often do not ask questions to clarify. This means that students are basically just being talked at, with it all just going above their heads. However, when FACS recognizes that a student doesn't understand or is bored it ""... could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" says Dr. Huang. This means that when a student needs help understanding something the computer will cater to each student until it senses that they understand the lesson. This could drastically improve participation and engagement in the classroom by ensuring that each student understands. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to it helping students learn more effectively. Through its ability to help both teachers and students, FACS would be a valuable asset in the classroom. Sitting in classrooms around the world right now are students who do not understand what they are being taught. This could be changed forever with the implementation of FACS in the classroom, with a smaller percentage of students failing classes and a higher level of understanding being a direct result from the implementation of FACS.                ","Sure technology is great but, can we really trust it? Self driving cars are quickly approaching, so before they are here we must go over the negative aspects it will have. My stance on self driving cars is, they are unsafe and not perfectly created A few problems we might encounter with a self driving car is, problems with the law, and technology issues/malfunction. The law states that its main focus is keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Laws assume the only safe way to acheive that is with alert drivers. How can we trust a robot to drive a vehicle, with no real thought process? What if they malfunction and someone gets injured, then we have discuss whos liable and its a big ordeal. The text states "" New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" The main message is who is liable for a mistake in the cars accident? The driver or the manufacturer? Secondly, Computer malfunction and technology issues have been occuring since the dawn of computers. So, whos to say it wont happen to a car? Smart cars are relished to be great and accident free but in the case of an electronic malfunction, I beg to differ. Also, are hackers able to tune into your car and mess it up electronically? YES! By bypassing your cars security system, they will have full access to your car from the inside, and be able to shut it down or cut off certain features. So the smartest move is to stick with manually driven cars for the safety and concern of our people. But they are currently working on these issues as stated "" Automakers are continuing their work on the assuption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Smart cars may be a new intuitive way to drive a car, but they need to be more harshly critisized for the safety of young children and adults. Sure smart cars can be safe and effective but they MUST be one-hundred percent proven and out of technological disorder for the maximum protention of our countries people.",,,,,,,
129,563,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform it has been a pop icon since it started in HollyWood Films, Books, Magazines, Talk shows, and haunted check-out lines for more than 20 years!. How could The Face on Mars be created by aliens if aliens aren't real? Why would NASA go through all that trouble to make a fake Face on Mars. The face is a natural landform because, before it was a face NASA captioned it as a ""Huge rock formation"". It was a humans head it was also formed by shadows, which made it seem like the huge rock formation had eyes, nose, and a mouth. But it was just an illusion. NASA knew that if they were to put the ""huge rock formation"" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right! As soon as the huge rock formation was on Mars that's when NASA started getting all the attention NASA knew was coming. So this is why I state that NASA's ""huge rock formation"" is NOT fake, like I said earlier why would NASA go through so much trouble just to make a fake humans head on Mars? ","Dear Principal: I think we should have cell phones during lunch periods and other free times because, it will give us a chance to talk to our other friends in different classes. We shouldn't have our cell phones on in class because it will distract you from listening to instructions. When you don't listen to instructions or what the teacher is telling you, you won't learn the material for the day. Cell Phones should only be used for emergencies only because certain teens don't know how to use during free time. For example, if you don't bring your phone to school how would your parent know if you're doing extra stuff after school. If your parents don't know then they will get worried about if you are safe or not. In some ways it's important to have a cell phone. During lunch time and free time that's the time to take out your phone because when you take it out in class when you're not supposed to, your phone gets taken away and your mad at the teacher for your mistake. If your going to have a phone just know how to use the phone in your free time and whenever an adult in school tells you to use it. Having your phone on during class is distracting because if you forgot to turn down the ring volume and it goes off in class, your phone will probably get taken away by your teacher. Only use the phone when you need to if you are texting your parents then that's one thing if you're texting your friends you see them any way at lunch or in class. Using a phone in school is a privilege because you have to ask your teacher or you have to wait until you have lunch or free time. Allowing kids to bring phones to school and use them is a big responsibility, and to use them during free time and during lunch is the only time to use them.","A lot of ideas come right to me when I think about having C average and I think children should not be able to play because this will teach them responsibility, and they might pull up there grades if they really wanted to play, and they will pull up the grade and have the school be represented with high quality students. Responsibility is something so many kids in schools do not understand yet. They need to know that in a couple of years they will have college and things will get really difficult. We need our children to understand that their grades will ruin them if they do not try to do their best at school. Education is so important, one mistake can destroy a person. Children might think that having a B average is hard but if they really want to play a sport I know that every person can do It . Students every year get held back because of low grades and the conduct. Having only A and B average students play sports and other activities. This will teach students with lower average than at least a B that they need to show that they can do a whole lot better and raise there grades up to the standard to play. A lot of kids think they can get away with playing sports while there grades are below what we want them to be and if we prevent them from having to much power they will see that they can not be able to do something they cherish and love. Possibly parents and students do not care about what their child has on report cards, but I am guarantied that our school and school systems care. We do not want a school to look bad and show bad examples for others. Principals like to have compliments that they get from others about how great they run the school and the high quality averages. Schools get to feel special if the kids work hard. They might get to go somewhere or be represented and show what they got and know. Students, parents, grandparents, teachers and especially principals, need to show kids what they are capable of doing and how important it is for them, their schools and for others that will look at you and your steps and examples. This is why I think principals should have a no lower than a B average for sports and activities. Students will have responsibility, raise their grades up, and have their schools appreciated by the high education and grades they get.      ","Do I think drivers should be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Although this topic is an on-going debate I do not believe that drivers should be able to use their cellular devices to a certain extent whie driving. What I mean by this statement is that drivers should be able to use their phones if a gps is needed, however only with a phone holder in the car. Also, people should be able to make urgent calls here is three reasons why i think people shouldnt be able to use their cellphones because you can cause traffic collision. Also, it puts not only the driver in danger but other drivers also. Its also ilegal to be on the phone while your driving. The government made a new law the hands free law. The hands free law is a new law in the united states the hand free law is all drivers operating a moving vehicle on any highway of the state are prohibited from holding an electronic device while driving. Also, NO TEXTED WHILE DRIVING! Another one is no watching videos, movies and etc while driving. If you break a law their are always fines that you would have to pay so if its your first time breaking the hands-free law the fine is $50.00 the second time you break this law the fine will be $100.00. You are not allowed to us your cell phone while driving but you can use your phone if you stop the car not at a stop sign but like if your stop to park somewhere then you can get on your cellphone. I feel like if you need to used your cellphone like for an emergency you should go to the nearest parking lot and then do what you got to do.       ","It could be a opportunity of a lifetime to travel over sea's and be a Seagoing cowboy. It can lead your family to host a number of international student to help educate them in learning like school for them. You can help people with their needs and other countries that suffer without food or water. Being a Seagoing cowboy can lead to many different adventures in life. Luke said for being a Seagoing Cowboy he lead his family to host lots of international students and exchange visitors for many years. He overthought about going too but he just couldn't just skip this opportunity of a lifetime. He also didn't know his life would change really quick right after high school graduation. World War II was over in Europe and many countries were left in pieces. Luke was very suprised about going over sea's. It took him about two weeks for him to cross the Alantic ocean. It also took him a month to get to China because he was so far away from China. He has helped out his Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Which had made him brave enough to cross the oceans just him and some other people on board of the ship or boat. That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did he fell and sliped up he ended up being fine.","I'd have to say the new technology ''Facial action coding system'' that has been created in Illionois is acceptable. It beyond helpful in my perspective it could really help out young children whom don't understand what the teacher is saying. '' A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then modify the lesson like an effective human instructor''. This quote states how it the new technology is being used. Especially children who dont understand english. Without saying anything verbally to the computer, and it could help some students outs! It would be extra heplful if it had that ability to translate. The reason why I am saying this because there are some whom don't want to speak and are simply quite and usually just give a face in which the compter can caculate you. And the fact that we humans preform the same expression'' as said in paragraph 5. Inconclusion this would probably help out the students who dont speak for them selves. And increase the ability for young children to be stress free and more understanding in what subject they are currently learning and hopefully be sucessful.","People for many years have always been fasinated with self-driving cars. Since 2009 google has had cars that can drive automatic under certain conditions, but no driverless car has been truly driverless. Although driverless cars have a lot of positive aspects about them, there are more negative. I believe they are wrong. First, they are not safe. Not one driverless car has been able to drive safely without the help of a actual driver. If road costruction, accidents, or roadblocks come up then the driver must help and take over. So, If the driver falls asleep in the vehicle and doesn't hear the warnings that help is needed then there could be a crash or collision. Second, the amount of money that would need to be put into this action. If driverless cars were to become a part of today's society then we would be wasting alot of money to make one car. What if people can't afford to pay for a self-driving car? Then will the smart cars still be able to risk the possibility of crashes when all the other cars or drivers on the street aren't safe. The smart car can't detect everything. To make a driverless car the vehicle needs a lot of sensors. Sensors are not cheap and the car needs a lot of them, that's roughly a couple million dollors. Lastly, the technology could fail. To have driverless cars you would need to do a lot of updating to keep everything udated with today's traffic laws and more. If a law is changed or a new stop sign is added or stop light then the technolgy could fail and cause a crash or collision. Then who's fault is it? The driver for not helping the car when needed or the manufacturer who made the car the way it is. Although driverless cars have a lot of postive aspects about them, there are more negative. I believe they are wrong. Driverless cars are just as dangerous as a person driving an actual car everywhere. There will be way to much conflict over this topic until they have everything working properly and everything is safe. Either way this topic is to big to avoid. ",,,,,,,
129,901,"The face. People think it was created by aliens, some others belive it's just a natural landform, but it is in fact a natural landform. Although it does look like a face, that aliens created, it is a landform created by a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, with shadows that make it look like it has facial features. A Martian mesa. That's all the face is. It was created by a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa, with shadows that give it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Martian mesas, are common enough around Cydonia, which is another reason why this could'nt have been created by aliens. Lastly, this couldn't have been aliens, because there is not enough scientific proof to even know if there is even any form of life on mars. The face is just a huge rock formation, with shadows that give you the illusion of facial features. Even though most people believe that it is a natural landform, some do believe it was aliens who created it. One reason is because, it is more benitfital for Nasa to keep quiet, and say it is a natural landform. Another reason is because, the face looks more like an alien face than a natural landform. Although there is more proof that it is a natural landform, that face could have been made by aliens. All in all the face appears to be a natural landform. Some people may disagree but, there is more facts and research, that the face is a natural landform. Although there is more facts about it being a natural lansdform, some people still will think it could have been aliens who created the face. But the face is just a huge rock formation created by a Martian mesa, with shadows that give you the illusion of facial features.          ","Dear Principal, I think that you should consider the first policy to allow students to use phones at school during free time. The reason is and fact that even if you don't allow students to use phones they will eventually use them anytime. To make it easier and allowing the students to use phones will allow them to feel like they have more freedom and obey the rules, well at least I hope. Also using them at their launch and free time will be more convenient and they will be able to finish whatever business they have before or after class without the pressure of being caught. I, personally, don't really use my cell phone much. The only reason why I have a cell phone is one for emergencies such as when an earthquake happens, tornadoes, unlikely, flood, injuries, to tell my parent where I am, or many when I'm abducted but alien, that could happen. Secondly is that I'm close to going to high school, and that all of my friends are going to a different school then I am and I really would like to keep in contact with them. Other then that really, i don't care about the phone policy at all, but you really should consider the first choice since it's about my vote, it's about the other students vote so hear from them and not me, because my phone is always turned off, and stuffed in the side of my backpack. I also think that the others would enjoy the privilege of using their somewhat treasured cell phones, and if they take advantage of this privilege then go with the second choice , because I'm not supporting anything that going to interfere with my learning environment. So first you could try out the first policy and if it just doesn't work then try the second policy. From Your Student, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principal, This change is a bad idea. Students should be able to participate in after school activities with a C average for these reasons. A C is a passing grade, the rule is fine now so why should we change it?, and if you did change it more people wouldn't be able to participate in these activities. A C is a passing grade. It may not be honoroll worthy, but it will get you through high school. It is one thing for a D not to be able to participate because it is not a passing grade, but a C should because it is a passing grade. The rule is currently a C so why should we change it? It is also the way our parents did it, and they turned out just fine. Most of the people who are graduating have turned out fine too. Like that saying "" Don't fix it if its not broken"". If you make the change then there wont be a lot of people participating because most people have a C average. For sports there wont be enough people to make teams, so our teams would have to forfeit. This would give the school a bad sports program, and a bad reputation about it. As you can see there are many reasons not to make the change! Everything is good now so don't change it. Take the students advice and don't change it. Thank you! Senilely, STUDENT_NAME","Phones and Driving Drivers should they or should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle? Drivers should not attend to a mobile device while operating a vehicle. This action is the main source of car accidents due to decreasing the drivers awareness on the road causing injury and/or death . Some states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving to take precaution. Driving distracted is one of the main causes of car accidents over the last two decades. Each year 6 million cases of car accidents take place, which roughly per day is 16,438. About 3 million people are injured or disabled and 6,000 deaths happen annually. According to statistics in 2010 the loss of human lives due to car accidents cost almost 1 trillion dollars, the highest price we pay for the loss of others in the collision of vehicles. Most states have passed or are passing a law, illegal to use your phone while operating a vehicle. Most states banned use of cell phones while driving are different from others or either similar. For example the state of Georgia banned all drivers under the age of 18 and school bus drivers to the utilization of phones. As in Arizona school bus drivers and learner's permit and existing license holders during the first six months after licensing aren't allowed to operate a mobile device while the driver's vehicle is in motion. Although these states' rules are slightly contrasted from each other, the use of texting, hand held calls, and possession of devices in the palm is prevented. Cell phones are a very dangerous distraction to you and those around you, but can have its benefits such as navigation and the use for help or assistance. Many cell phones have GPS assistance which provide direction to arrive at your designated destination. Cell phones also allow users to contact aid whether its an ambulance, the police, or help with your car while on the road. Although these actions are very safe they should not be acquired while a vehicle is in motion to prevent any dangerous interactions. In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving. Put down your mobile device, the call or text received is worth the wait than worth being in a major or minor accident. Without the distraction your attention is focused on the road and your surroundings. This action taken is safer for you and your environment.

The adventure that we go on are eye opening. Helping around the places we go are very fun but can also dangerous . Even though your on a boat or ship you can find fun in spare time. There are also benefits of going places around the world like Europe and China. Other places that benefits you is Greece you can see the Acropolis, and more.

As in addtion to my statement there are a lot of people and things that the peole need ,an if those people could change places with use they would do the same. The UNRRA has helped the Seagoing Cowboys programe ship and improve. So I think that every one sould want to be a part of the Seagoing Cowboys.","I think the Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom. I think this because It can help out a lot. When a student doesn't want to explain thier emotions or don't know how to share emotions this system can be helpful and valuable. And I mean it is pretty cool that a facial system can calculate anyones emotions. And this FACS sounds totally unharmless. In the article it explains how this system works. I will be wrtiting about how it works and get examples from the article. In the article it says that an action unit can calculate movement of one or more msucles and can detect the emotion. Dr. Paul, the creater of FACS states that he has calssified 6 different emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness all with the FACS. Examples of how the FACS can detect your emotion is in your face movements for example, as said in the story when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when you are surprised; your orbicularis oris tightens your lips when you are angry. It is fantastic how this can know the emotion you are feeling. I think FACS can actually be valuable in classrooms. A teacher can detect weither a student is happy,sad,angry, or surprised. It can be very useful for students that when they want to talk to thier teachers but don't know how to explain themelves this can help. FACS can help out in many more ways, useful ways. So my statement is this technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and I also think students would enjoy trying it out.","Driverless cars becoming the new thing i think is pretty cool. In the argumentive essay i will be for driverless cars! To think that a while back some people didnt have cars and now we are trying to create a driverless car is amazing. In this essay i will state my three reasonings on why i am for driverless cars. While reading this paper i saw that a plus side to these driverless cars would be the gas. The text states ""The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Gas prices are something many american people have to deal with on the daily. We all know that gas is not the cheapest thing the world has to offer. By these driverless cars though if they found a way to improve in technology and use half the feul it takes for a real car then this is a big plus side on the driverless cars. Another reason i am for driverless cars is because they seem to have made this car as safe as it could possible be. In the driverless car there are sensors located everywhere doing different things. Without these senors the car wouldnt be able to function as a driverless car. The text says ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels."" If it wasnt for senors this car would no longer be safe, in my persepective. The senors located in these driverless cars all play an important role to keep the driverless cars driverless. A huge reason i am for these driverless cars are because if we can accomplish a driverless car, who knows where that will take us next. In the first paragraph the author says ""He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" I personally could not agree with the statment more. If the driverless car becomes a thing then what will be next, everyone has there own high tech planes? As i said that i am for driverless cars i can also see through people who arent for it. New things are always scary, but how will we advance in technology if we never give new things a try. I hope this argumentive essay might of helped convince you a little more to open up to the idea of driverless cars.               ",,,,,,,
129,923,"The Face Was Created by Landform The Face, a well known landmark on the planet of Mars, is a landmark that has caused NASA a lot of debate. The debate is ""Was The Face created by aliens, or was it created by natural landform?"". This has caused NASA and many scientists to have problems, because there are a few scientists that believe that The Face was created by aliens. The Face was originally discover in 1976, by the photographers aboard NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In the picture taken in 1976, you can clearly see a face in the landform. But in the picture taken in 1998, the atmosphere was extremely cloudy, so if there was any indention in Mars's base, you couldn't see it because of the clouds. Because of this, scientists went out on another attempt to capture a good image of The Fcae on Mars, and they succeeded. The picture that was taken in 2001 clearly showed that The Face was no longer there, which lead scientists to believe that it was a combination of natural landform and the shadows casted from the sun's rays that made that particular spot look like           ","Dear principle, I think your idea of allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time, might be the best or possible policy because i don't think that its fare to not allow phones in school at all. I know that were' re in school and we are there to learn, but shouldn't we be able to have some kind of reward for doing school. sometimes there are student that doesn't do any work and just sit at text all day, but what about the others. I would say that if you do happened to see ANY student texting in class or on their phone period then you would probably have to take it. I also think that it's bad enough we have to wear uniforms, now we cant have phone either. If the principle did decide to not let phones into schools at all, then i really wouldn't understand why because i know that us students are tired of hearing the same thing over and over again about cell phones killing or taking over our brain sells. I think the best way for the principle to pick which policy would be to let the students vote on it and if policy one gets picked then the principle would just have to do something about the students that are using their phones in school. I can see a lot of students being sneaky and conniving by using their phones in school. So to tell the truth it really doesn't matter to me if the principle picks policy 1 or 2. I think that students are concentrated in their phone then they on their school work. And it would be there fault when the do bad on a test or even when they loose their phone or get there phone taken. And that's all i would have to say because it wouldn't be on the principle it would be on the student.","Dear Principal, I am glad that you want students to have good grades to be able to play in sports and other school activities. I do not agree that us students should have a B average to participate. Some students can only get as far as a C average. The lowest average us students should have is a C average. It would be unfair to only let B average students participate in recreational activities because not everyone is great at school but they do look forward to being active and healthy. We should be able to take part in these activities because a C average is passing grade average. We should be allowed to play sports or join clubs as long as we have a passing average. I disagree with this policy that we must have at least a B average. C average is a passing average. We should be able to have as low as a C average. More people would be able to participate if it was a C average instead of a B average. Thank you for your time.","Should drivers be able to use their phone while operating a vehicle? The age of technology is upon humanity and is affecting the species far more than anyone has expected. With more modernized devices being released at such a fast pace, it is not likely that one human of five will not have one. Technology, especially the usage of smart phones, has become ultimately distracting to humans. Operating a vehicle, however, is not the time to be distracted. Any driver, no matter the experience or skill, should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle because it is hazardous to themselves and others, and it is a leading cause of death. To begin with, the distraction of a cellular device is most dangerous to the driver. Not only are they putting their life on the line to send a text or view a snapchat, they are also putting their license up for suspension and possible jail time because it is an illegal activity. Any impairment of a driver is an illegal act and can be tried in the court of law. These drivers willingly know the consequences when they pull out their phone. It is important that the driver adhere to the responsibility bestowed upon them for the safety of themselves and others. Any mistakes made while moving are solely the driver's fault. A text or a call cannot amount to the value of a life, and the act of texting while driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In other words, it would be thought that driving while using a phone would be less of an issue. However, it is one of the number one causes of death. Moreover, the management of a cellphone while driving is one of the main causes of death today. These on-going issues have led to ""1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" (The National Safety Council Texting and Driving Statistics - Distracted Driving). Not only are these wrecks traumatic to everyone involved, they effect the loved ones of those who got injured or died. With such high stats, humans have began working to fix this matter in question. Many modern cars have come out with Bluetooth in the radio system which assists the driver with using his or her phone without actually using their phone. Bluetooth allows drivers to play music, text, and call all with minimal work applied. This update in technology can be seen as a breakthrough in modern advancements; but, it also has its faults that come along with it. While managing to make the Bluetooth setting work, drivers can also find themselves just as distracted. Losing focus for five seconds or more on the road increases the risk of accidents and injuries. Looking somewhere else other than the road is just another second that the driver is not looking at oncoming traffic or pedestrians. To conclude, a driver should not be allowed to use a cellular device while managing or operating a moving vehicle due to the risk of harming themselves as well as others, and the fact that it is illegal today and everyday following. Being a hazard on the road makes a hazard for everywhere around it. In this period of time, humans are developing technology to prevent this topic from happening in the future; however, until fully preventable, it should not be permitted.

The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level. With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned. Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart. In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom. Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!         ","I dont not feel driverless cars are needed,because driverless cars are only going to make humans more and more lazy. There not safe for the driver or for the pedestrians. If the was to be a crach or the car were to hit someone who would be resonable the buyer to the car or manufacturer of the car? These are just some of the thing that could go wrong that the artical has pointed out. There are also thing the artical didnt say like how meny job there getting rid of by making the cars driverless. There are job like taxi-drivers; bus-drivers; lemo-drivers and semi-dervers all out of jobs. Then you have people who aren't comterble not being the one driving and get car sick. What happend if theres ice on the ground and the car reads the spead limit as 60mps. It may break, but its going to slid and hit something or someone. There's also the fact what if someone doesn't have a driverless car and there trying to run a red light a human that was driving might be aware and stop, but someone in a driverless car are more likely not to see it because there mor then likely texting or playing on the phone then watching the road. Then there's a huge crash. These are someone of the little things no one thinks about because people think the more lazy we're able to be then the better off the world is, but its not. I can see all the good things that can come of driverless cars but bad thing weight out over the good things. There isn't a way to be sure of the safty of drivers, pedestrians, and property. To meny things can go wong that if there was a human driver if wouldn't happen. Thing like driving slow in rain and snow or even being able to pay attention to the road the someone with the money to buy a driverless car is trying to run a light. I feel if we can't garanteed the safty of all perple animals and property around us im not for driverless cars. ",,,,,,,
957,220,"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. Drivers are at a four time greater risk of causing an accident when driving and texting. While using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing. According to the ""National Safety Council"" ""Cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 1.6 million crashes a year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage."" Not many take driving seriously until you consider how many people die each day and how many in a year due to a fatal car crash. Well According to ""Teen Safety"" ""Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash."" Distracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage, eating, drinking, operating a radio, or even being lost in thought, it can lead to injuries or even death. When a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph, Depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident. When drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them. Drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone else's life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage. Drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their life or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries. Drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them. So in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someone's life whether it's the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle.      ","Venus is the closest planet to Earth and one of the brightest points in a dark sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has proved it is very challenging to get data from the planet. The biggest question with Venus is it worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Astronomers should try to get more data because it imbodys Earth more than any other planet. Venus has features that are very simurlar to those on Earth. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" It shows that Venus is very a like to Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has had new and safe ideas so that we can still reserch Venus even with the dangers. They want to floaut above the fray. Wouldn't be easy conditions, but not hard enough to kill humans. Now you know how dangers and worthy the explorion on Venus would be. But you sholudn't let a little fear get in the way of the fun and Knowlege on getting. Wanting to do the challege on Venus has value, has dangers, and doubts but what are you scarred of you'll die any way.","Google is trying to make things easy by creating a driveless car. Im for these new cars I think it would make things alot easier for some driver's that get nervous and are not paying attenion to the road. It would be useful when your driver by an accident or proventing a accident driving by an construction site. It would kind be like taking a taxi or bus but not have worry about having to call and get a taxi or missing the bus and or finding a seat on the bus. In article it states thier cars have driven half a mile without a crash but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless ; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. The cars have been proven that they are caoable of driving witout crashing but there not fully capable of drivering by thereself. In the article it states Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position -estimating sensors on rear wheel. rotating sensor on the roof a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver , and an inertial motion sensor. That can help alot with people not checking the driveway as there sometimes late for work of just in a rush to get somewhere. In conclusion i feel like the car would be a great help to people everwhere. It could stop alot of accident's and it help in traffic.","I think policy 1 is better because some students need their phones for important things. They should let everyone do that because not all students will call someone while they are at school because it is not appropriate. I think that my principal should give us a try just for one day to see how it would turn out but if we do good then we could do it as a privilege but if we are really bad then we could go back to the rule where we cant bring them. The only time that they wont be able to use them during class because we need to pay attention in class to do good on the TAKS test. I think that it would get the children to behave more so that they could use their phones on their free times. If it doesn't I don't know what will because I know that I would always do good with or without it. Sometimes that is what it takes to make them act better to reward them with things that will make them want to behave in class and in the hallways. I think that the only reason they act bad at times is because they are bored and have nothing else to do. If I were a principal I would try it to see how things change if it makes great changes I would keep it that way, but if it is worse then i would change the rule back and they wont be able to bring them at all. I would hope and pray that it would work out well and not get worser than what it is. I like to see people happy because it makes me feel happy inside and out too. So, please, please, please give us a shot at it!!! But if you don't I understand that it is your decision because you don't want to take any chances just incase it gets worse but it would be very nice of you if you did.","Dear Principal, I know you are debating whether or not to require all students to partake in community service, and I'd like to offer some insight on what I think about this subject. I believe that many students would be reluctant to perform community service, some for simply being lazy, while others genuinely have a busy schedule on a day to day basis, and simply wouldn't have the time to do community service. I believe that both the community and even the children themselves could benefit from doing community service, however if it is against their will, I don't think something like this should be forced upon kids. Many children nowadays do a lot of extracurricular activities in and out of school, these activities are mostly sports, musically oriented activities, and artistic activities. Most kids love the extracurricular activities they do, and they have probably been doing them for years. To take that away from somebody, is to change a part of that person's life, without their consent. Children already have most of their choices made for them, and if you simply require community service to be completed by kids, then I believe they will revolt, and maybe even rebel against doing that type of work. Doing this to kids is like treating them as second class citizens. Adults are not forced to do things such as this, so why should children? We also have hopes and dreams, although we are not fully developed physically and mentally, we still have the ability to think, and to feel, just as you do. If you were forced to do something such as this, how would you feel? Along with not being able to drive, to stay out at night, and many other things you were once prohibited of doing, and we still are today. We only have one childhood, one chance to do all the stupid things we want to do before we have to become serious, and truly enter the world as adults. If you can remember what it's like to be a child, to see the world, as my peers and I do, you would understand where I come from when I say these things. Our lives aren't difficult, but they soon will be, from high school, to college, to working, right now is the only time we are truly free from the bonds of labor. So please Principal, please let us enjoy our youth to the fullest, and do not make us have to perform community service, without our consent. I'm sure many children at our school would be grateful if your decision reflects the feelings of yourself, but of the entire school community. Thank you for reading this letter. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      ","Some reasons why being a sea cowboy is a good idea. It is very occupational, working the stables and feeding the animals makes the trip seem less long. There are very many sights to see, such as, taking relaxing gondola rides in Venice, touring excavated sites like the elegant castles in Crete, seeing the famous Acropolis in Greece. There are many more exotic and beautiful structures to be seen as a Seagoing Cowboy. Along the way gift shops and antique stores that can be visited and bought from. Places like China are availible to visit and see. The program has all of these offers as well as delivering all of the animals that are on board with you. This is an even greater opportunity to young men who have just come out of high school, it can open things up for them. Help them realize and be aware, that there are other people who have needs in other countries. After it's all over, you can take another trip if you wish to. Being a sea cowboy means more than just moving animals from place to place. It helps others in need, people who have nearly nothing. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can make all the difference. That is why being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good career choice.                ","Have you ever felt like your opinion dident matter? There is lots of contriversey over the popular topic of the Electoral College,and wheter its good or bad. The electoral college is not an actual college, in fact its not a place at all. The founding fathers wrote it in the constitution as a comprisie between the election by the people or by congress for president. Some of Americas most iconnic people even agredon abolishing the Electoral College,and i agree. In the system of the Electoral College the voters are not truley voteing for the pesident,but for there states elctors. The state electors are the ones who then vote for president. The electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. In simple terms the Electoral College is not fair to voters. The reson behind this is the winner take all system that each state has in place. So the canidates dose not waste time in states they know they have no support or chance of winning the popular vote. A dispute over the Electoral College's final decision is possible,for example it happened in 2000. However it is less likely than an arughment over the popular vote. This is because the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College undoubtably execeeds the share of the popular vote. With the Electoral College in place some people dont even see the point in voteing. Overall the Electoral College does more harm than it does good. America is supposed to be about the people, and we are a democracey. We should be the ones picking our own President by popular vote. With the Electoral College in place we are takeing more power away from the people and giving it to the goverment. It may be written in the constitution but its a new generstion and its time for change.         ",,,,,,,
957,563,Hello today I'm going to be talking about the majority of humans that own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. First I would like to say that driving and operating a cell phone at the same time wouldn't be a great idea. In this day of age 2020 everyone rely on there cell phones to do everything some people rely on it to get their destination using a gps located on your cell phone. Or either texting someone on there phone instead of going to them face to face and talking. Now that I've told yawl about the use of cell phones in are day and age lets talk about should or shouldn't people not be able to use cell phones in a vehicle. Personally I think people shouldn't be able to be on there phones while driving. It's a safety hazard and if you would look at the news the you would see how many car accidents there are. People lost there lives because other people want to be on their cell phones that's not fair at all. That's why I feel the way I feel about cell phones and driving it doesn't have to be like that if people would put there phones down and drive. And for all the people that can't stop texting and driving should be punished. Cause they have other people family die it isn't right. If there was no cell phones then all the lives and car accidents could have been prevented.     ,"The author states that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, venus is a really hot planet and the earth is in between venus and mars but venus is closer to earth. Scientists start to study venus but it's very too hot to go to venus so scientists try to make inventions that will get information on why venus is so hot. Venus is dangerous because it is soo hot and you wouldn't make it in the conditions there. In paragraph 3 the author states "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments"". It also states some examples of the dangerous things like ""erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes "". Scientists are still trying to visit to venus surface even tho it's inhospitable because they are fascinated by venus because venus use to be the earth's most-like planet in our solar system. Scientistist wants to know what it is that is making venus sooo hot because like in paragraph 4 it says "" long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". Then scientistst study that venus is the hottest planet and they are now trying to study why venus is so hot. Now NASA is trying to send humans to study venus. NASA also has a solution for scientists to go study venus in paragraph 5 it says "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" NASA made this solution so that scientists would study venus but at the same time they would be safe while doing it . NASA is now workin on other approaches to studying venus. In paragraph 7 the author states "" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". This also shows that tying to study venus is dangerous because you wouldn't make it very long on the planet even if you've invented things to try and help. The author is trying to get out that studying venus can be very dangerous because of the conditions venus is going thorugh. Venus is the most hottest planet and it is not the best planet to be studying because it is very dangerous. ","From reading the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, it is a good idea to have driverless cars. They can really help with the world. It is a great idea to use these new cars because they use less fuel than today's cars, it allows betters response and control than a human, and if there is a problem the car can notify the driver. Everyday humans use up a lot of gas. The gas that is being use harms the earth and makes it dirty. Using the Driverless car would help the enviorment more in terms of keeping it a clean place to live. In the article it states,"" The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" We can save more gas and the enviorment would be cleaner. Everyone wants to live in a clean and healthy enviorment so the driverless car would be a step in the right direction. It will also help with car accidents. Another way that the smart cars would help out is by causing less accidents. There are far too many car accidents in the world from people who either cannot drive or they dont push the brakes in time. The driverless car controls that. In the article the authors says,""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" If the driverless car could respond faster than a person than we should have the driverless cars. It would cause less accidents and more people would survive. The driver would still be in control of the car though. Lastly, another reason there should be driverless cars is beacuse even if some of the stuff cannot be done by the car, the person driving it can do something too. For example lets saythe driver is driving in a work or school zone and they have to slow down, they can do that without the car doing it. In the article it says,""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills,such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The driver would not have to let the car do all the work. In some cases the driver is going to have to do something and actually drive. The articles says that the car can run 90% on its own. Therefore the other 10% is the driver. The driver is going to have to stay alert and be ready when problems arise. The driverless car is a fantastic idea and invention to have. The world needs more cars like them so that the world could be a better and more safe place to drive. Having a driverless car that can use less gas, have better response and control,and notify the driver in case of an emergency is a great car to have. The world could do a lot by having it.","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think students should not be allowed to use our cell phones during lunch and free period. I think this because of cheating, bullying, and disturbance in class. Because cell phones are an easy way to communicate students will take it for granted on tests, essays or homework. Students will be able to give an answer or even the questions on the test with ha click of a button. This is not fair to other students who studied hard or did their homework when they were suppose to. teachers will notice a dramatic change in grades from period one to period seven. Even though students would only be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free period, answers still travel quick. Because of cell phone use answers to tests, essays or homework will be spread to the whole school. Isn't school suppose to be a friendly and safe environment? I know that with cell phones the bullies have more sneaky ways and techniques to bully a peer. When sending a text message it is received by the person instantly. Therefore more horrific comments will be spread all over during lunch and free period. With cell phones these nasty comments will not be caught. Chances are no will no but the two bullies texting and receiving the messages. When bullies know that they are not going to get caught they will keep bullying. Then the bullying trend will come an even more popular style. You might think that all students are going to listen and turn off their cell phones during class but they wont. They will take advantage! During class students come to learn and expand their knowledge. With the disturbance of constant ringing and vibrating their learning experience will be interrupted. I know that teachers want to have a learning environment but when they hear a cell phone they will lecture on about how that is not acceptable. That too will take away from the students learning time. Cell phones are suppose to be helpful but not disruptive. Students might love the idea having usage of cell phones allowed, but it would not be a good choice. Cell phone usage during lunch and free period will have students chatting on tests, essays, and homework. cell phones also will increase bullying and will be a huge distraction during school. School is a safe environment and cell phones will interfere with your students learning experience. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principle, I understand that some students do not like or want to do community service for reasons their own. I think that making it a requirement to do community service is a very bad idea. We should not make community service a requirement on the students because it will have most wanting to go to another school because they can do community service on their own time, students will purposely miss school so they can have the option for community service, you will most likely get a lot of complaint letters from parents and that can be very dangerous. My first reason for this not being a good idea is students can do community on their own time because community service is volunteer work not demanded work from people. If some people do it and some people don't oh well, they don't have to do it if they want to . most students like me don't have very much free time because of school and family work and business issues. Secondly, students will miss school for other things like friends and home. and most of all students don't like getting told what to do because this is our life and we want to live it with people and they can choose community service they choose. If at school there is a threat parents will make sure the student doesn't come to school. Last but not least, you will receive mail of some sort from parents and they will be very colorful at least most of them will be. If they were from my mom they defiantly will be like that and a few more things will be said that will be very mean. so I would not even try the requirement of community service. I conclude that if you make a requirement of community service you are in for lots of trouble!","Help wanted! The Seagoing Cowboys program is in need of help from other herders. Why would anyone want to do this? With the program, you are able to help out other people, do things you typically would not do, and have fun. I think it is beneficial to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you are able to help out people. It is important to help people because not only does it benefit them, it benefits you as well by bringing joy in to your life. In the text it states that in 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. This is just one reason why this program is beneficial. Another reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is becuase you get to do different things in your free time that you would not normally get to do. In the text it says that they got to tour many places. My final reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is because you get to have fun. In the text, it says that while they were unloading the animals, they played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading and even whittling. These are just a few reasons why I think that people who join the program will have lots of fun. In conclusion to all of this, I think the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial to all.  ","Dear Senator, The Electoral College should not be the deciding vote for the president of the United States of America. Every popular vote of the people should be counted towards deciding the next president. If America is a democracy and in a democracy people pick the leader then every citizen's vote should count, not just the majority. First things first, only a few states have taken action towards my claim. Those being Maine and Nebraska. These states have made a ""proportional representation"", which is unlike the ""winner take all"" that the other 48 states have adopted. The text states ""Most states have a winner take all method system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"" (What Is the Electoral College?7).This portrays that with the ""winner take all"" method various amounts of U.S. citizen votes have gone unaccounted for. Multiple occasions have dimmed the surface of our elections where their voices aren't heard. The author says ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer 11). Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people's votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electoral votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of Representitives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close. On the other hand, it is much harder to calculate the total number of the  popular vote being that there are millions of people voting. It is much easier to count and not dispute over a hundred or so votes than a million. But, having people know that their vote doesn't make it to actually voting for the president makes them not as ethuisiastic about voting. The text says ""no voter's vote swings an election""(Posner 23). This explains why only about one half of eligible American voters voted. In conclusion, America is a democracy, which means people elect the president, not a elector but the people. The author states ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer 14). This further explains that electors cannot make decisions without being biased toward their party. Also portraying well, the feelings of many Americans who feel the same way.                     ",,,,,,,
957,901,"Phones and Driving Using your phone while driving, everyone knows it's illegal to do this. Using your phone while driving is dangerous thing to do because your looking at the road. You can't see where you're going or what's in front of you. This doesn't stop people from being on their phones though. In some cases though being on your phone for an emergency can help you be aware of where you need to be at that time. Being on your phone posses a lot of danger for you and everyone around you. One person alone can cause a car rekt if they're on their phone. Because of this laws are put in place, but sometimes people will ignore those laws and be on their phone anyway. Causing a car crash or themselves panic a bit and speed up and nearly hit the car in front of them. Pretty much when you're driving, don't be on your phone because if you hear a car rev their engine you might think that the traffic is finally moving and hit the car in front of you because you were on your phone not paying attention. You should have very low phone usage since you're driving. If someone calls you while you're driving and it's a emergency, you shouldn't stay on the phone for long. Staying on the phone will cause you to focus more on the phone, without you being careful like you normally would when you're driving, because you're trying to get somewhere fast since it's an emergency. Instead of being careless of others around you, take your time when trying to get to that emergency, be mindful of what you're doing. You should never be on your phone and drive even if it's an emergency because you're caring about the other people around you, you just care to get to that emergency fast. In some cases though being on your phone can be 'helpful' in a way. Let's say you're on your phone and you get a text, you're going to look at the text regardless even if you're driving. When looking at the text, make sure you've stop stopped somewhere to look at it or in this case when you're driving, look to see if any cars are around you. Obviously texting while driving is the worst thing you can do. So when you're going to text while you drive make sure you look to see how many cars are around, stay mindful of your surroundings, and if possible try to find a spot and stop so can see the text without endangering anyone else because you're not looking at the road. In conclusion to being your phone when driving. You shouldn't do it even if it's an emergency or you just want to check your social media feed. You put yourself and everyone around you in danger because you're paying attention. If you decide to go on your phone though make sure you're stopped or at least almost no one is around you. Pretty much just stay off your phone when driving to keep yourself and others safe.         ","Venus, Earth's ""twin"" sister is a extordinary planet that may have been the most earth like planet in our solar system according to paragraph 4. It is also stated that Venus may have probably been covered largely with oceans that could support all form of life. Due to the dense atmosphere and toasty temperatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. It has been impossiple to let alone land on venus but even taking samples of Venus's rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. Many drones have been sent there to gather information about Venus according to paragraph 2. Each mission to land on Venus has ben unmanned due to the problem of no spacecraft not being able to survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even with all these issues with venus, stated in paragraph 7. NASA is still working on other approaches to studying Venus because again it is a extordinary planet that is said to have been suitible for all forms of life. Finding out what happend to make Venus be in the state it is right now would help the human race from stopping Earth from becoming like Venus. There has been many ideas to get a view on venus ground conditions such as peering from a orbiting ship but that would only give a limited insight due to the dense atmosphere. On paragraph 6 it is stated ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". That just goes to show you how landing on Venus or even getting the smallest bit of sample of it is a worthy pursit despite the risks and dangers of it. The curiosity of the human race is a powerful thing, Even though Venus is described as a dangerous planet. One day we will figure out the secrets Venus hold and perhaps even have a human land on the surface as well, until then we will just keep on working on more innovations that will one day allow us to get the insight of Venus.","I believe that driverless cars are unnecessary because of the liabilities that come with them, there's nothing wrong with standard cars, and too easy to take control over from an outside force. One of the reasons I think driverless cars are unnecessary is because of the liabilities. If the car doesn't alert you and tell you that you're about to crash and you end up hitting someone, who's at fault? You or the manufacturer? Certainly it would be the manufacturer, wouldn't it? But you should've been paying attention! You can't just expect the car to alert you every time! But, isn't that what it's supposed to do? How are we supposed to have driverless cars if you can't even come to a clear decision on whether it's the driver's or manufacturer's fault in the case of a crash? These cars will create too many complex legal battles and are unnecessary. Another reason I think driverless cars are unnecessary is that there is absolutely nothing with standard cars. Sure, people will be stupid and get behind the wheel under the influence; but, they will be able to be held accountable for their actions and have to pay fines, serve time, etc. What will become of people who just want to drive to drive? Standard cars provide security in knowing that the person behind the wheel will need to know what they're doing. What if a cell tower is down and the car won't be able to drive itself? How does the car drive in places with absolutely no reception? Driverless cars are not big of enough of a step up from standard cars. The final reason I feel that driverless cars are unnecessary is because they are too easy to take control over. Now, I do not mean that it's easy to just grab the steering wheel and turn the car into a random tree off the side of the road or anything like that. I mean that if a computer is driving the car, can't it be hacked into? Hackers can get into some of the most secure computers in the world, so what's stopping them from doing that with computers that drive cars? Say someone that is mentally ill enough to not like someone to the extent that they want them dead, isn't it easier to just hire someone to hack into their car computer and make them get into an accident? Driverless cars pose too many risks to people inside them as it is easier to be taken over by an outside force. Some may say that driverless cars can actually help and are a good invention. They can make driving across the country or down to Florida for spring break much easier than having to sit and pay attention to the road for sixteen hours straight. But, you still have to pay attention to the road. The car isn't completely accident-free. What if the dad who has all of his kids and his partner in the passenger seat starts drifting off at the wheel? It's dark and he doesn't have to focus on anything so what's keeping him awake? What if he doesn't wake up when his car alerts him that it is about to crash and the car gets totalled? Although seemingly incredible, driverless cars offer up far more cons than pros. That is why I believe that driverless cars are unnecessary because of the complexities of legal issues that come with them, they aren't much of a step up from standard cars, and they are too easy to take over from an outside perspective. Next time you start thinking about how nice it would be to have something drive your car for you, just think of the dynamics of everything that could be wrong with it and call a taxi service instead.",dear TEACHER_NAME we think we all should be allowed to bring your phone to school and use them during a lunch periods but as long as the phone is off or we should be able to use the phone to because it might be an emergency for us too. you just never know when something could appear to happen. and the teachers should do the same thing so it would be the same amount and it would be fair to both of us to students and teachers. so we wont be bored either for example if we are done with an assignment or maybe we should do are work at the same time while we are using are phone. and plus middle school students like to chat with their friends and every body likes to text the most cause middle school students think that we are adults now and we should be trusted to use are phone in middle school all the time. because we are almost there to being an adult. but for now we are young adults. we should be starting to be using are phone so we can get ready for high school. so that way we will become smart and we will really become into real adults.,"Dear Mr. Principal, My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think you should make the community service an elective for the 8 grade students you can give them a high school credit and for the 7th grade you can just give them a good grade. Other thing that you can do is to tell the people that want to help to came in the afternoon then tell them to tell their friends to came that you will give them an extra grade. You can make an enouncement with their parents telling the parents about the community service I know that the parents will tell them to do it because hey can make every thing they want in the week end. You can send a letter but not giving it to the students send an email or something like that but never give ti to the student because they will trough it in the trash. You can make a field trip to an elementary school or to a hospital and you can help the people first then tell them too. For the students that wants to be a teacher they will be happy if you take them to an elementary school and for the students that want to be a doctor they will be happy helping in the hospital. There are too much different way to tell the to help the community. Other thing that you can do is to call a person that helps the community to give them an speech or something like that. Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME","Do you like seeing different places and different countries? If so you should join the seagoing cowboys. You will be able to see lots off different cities and countries. Do you like to help people in need then you should join the seagoing cowboys. Lots of people need help ,they need food supplies ,animals and many other things. You will also be having lots of fun and you will be able to enjoy yourself. There are lots of other place to see and different foods. If you join now you will see different cities,countries and foods. There are lots of diffent types of food to try and maybe you might really like one type of food. Cities are diiferent from other ones they may be alike but not really. There are different types of cities to see . Countrys are way different nthan other ones and some other ones speak a different langue. Don't you think it would be great if you to lean a different langue? When you would come back to your home you would be ale to teach others different cultires and lanuges. Helping others is a great thing to do and very inportant. There are lots of people without food or cloths to wear. People need help because their towns have been destroyed and they have nothing left for them. They also need animals to perduse meat, wool, and they can sell htem so they can get money to buy things. Lots of those people are dieing from hunger or they are out side with no place to sleep or even sit. They need our help,they need your help. You might be think how am I going to get there. We will take you by boat but you might be wondering that seems boring and we will have nothing to do on the boat. There is lots of things to do on the boat. You can feed the animals as we take to different places. Does that seem boring to you if so you are right but there are othering things to do such as baseball and volleyball games and other games. On the back that is when you can really start having fun. SInce there are no animals on the boat that extra space can be use as a table-tennis room and you can have tournamets. You can also have fencing,boxing,reading, whittling. Do you still think you will not like being Seagoing CowBoys? There are many different food,cities,and countires. Helping the people in the need who dont't have food suplies and animals. Also all those fun games you would be able to play and how you would be able to make new friends and talk to different people. That seems like a great program i would join and i have joined the Seagoing CowBoys. To see different things,to help lots of people ,and to meet different people and have a good time with them. I don't know about you but I sure would want to be a part of the Seagoing Cowboys. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys program you would have a great time.         ","It is wise that election is chosen by popular vote. I think that it should be kept this way, and all that are Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. Election by popular vote is an easier choice and makes things more simple. It could give candidates more of a chance to get elected. Time would be wisely saved if all states had the same system, it would give people more of a chance to get elected. In the Electoral College voters vote for a portion of electors, not the president. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, this process is just undated and not right. A lot of states may not even see their candidates. If election by popular vote is used more than the places that don't, then they should be changed. It is just easier to decide when there are more or less voters. The Electoral College just has less of a chance to be kept. If every state did the same to elect then it would be easier to decide who should be the president of the United States.    ",,,,,,,
957,923,"Phones & Driving Imagine that you are driving and you get a text from someone and you feel that you just had to answer. Then you respond and when you look up your unable to stop in time and then everything goes black. This whole situation could have been avoided if being on your phone was not as important as your well being and others. Although it may be convenient to text while driving, it is increasingly becoming the reasons for car accidents today. Texting while driving in any situation while operating a vehicle should not be used. Texting while driving is causing you to not have at least one of your hands off of the wheel. Looking down at your phone will make you react to anything that may occur slower. Someone who is attentive is able to react to a possible accident occurring whilst the person texting and driving would not. This is known as defensive driving when one is able to defend yourself against dangers on the road. One who is using their device while driving lacks defensive driving. Using your mobile device while operating a vehicle is said to be ""approximately 18% of all fatal crashes are caused by texting and driving"", according to drive-safely. net. Within the year of 2012 itself, 3,328 people were killed because of texting and driving; while around 420,000 were injured. Also, a poll taken in the United States showed that 40% of teen drivers had admitted that they text and drive. These numbers have went up five times as much as they were. Most people do not know this or choose to ignore it but texting while driving is illegal. Many states either have specific or various laws about texting while driving. If there was an accident to occur and and authorities find out it is due to texting and driving then you will end up facing a judge. For example, if you were texting and driving and you were to distracted on your phone to see a pedestrian then you could be charged murder. People tend to text and drive without realizing that it may cost their life or someone else's. A text is never that important that could possibly change your life for the worse. It may be considered cool or easier to just be on your phone whenever you want, but it is the increasing reasoning for car accidents. Texting and driving is illegal for a reason and that should be a very serious law to abide by. Before you decide to pick up your phone while your driving just ask yourself: Is this really worth putting myself or others at risk? Works Cited DriversEd. com. ""Defensive Driving Techniques.""

","In ""The Challenge of Explorating Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it persents. The author supports their claim with the excitement in their tone, never negative about a situation, just eager to figure out a solution. In the passage, it is talked about how important the explorations of Venus really is by how comparable it was to Earth in the past. It most likely was once, the most Earth-like planet, ""probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."" (Paragraph 4) Dedicated to the study of Venus, the author claims how not even the dangers will get in his way. They will just simply work their way around them. What makes the study of venus so important is the large possiblity that it used to be just like how Earth is now. If that's true, first off, the only way to be able to know that for certain is to study it. Secondly, we need to know the dangers of what our world could become. In paragraph 8 of ""The Challenge of Explorating Venus"", The author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" In this quote, the detrmination of the author clearly shines through. There are many ""challenges"" of venus, like the clouds in the atmosphere made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, and how the surface temperature would liquify many mentals. But like in the quote, the studies of Venus need to be continued so that people aren't left to wonder if our would could become like Venus. The author supports his claim by presenting us with what we could be left without if the studies woudld have to stop. We would be left with no explination of the future of our own planet. Left without the knowledge of what Venus is like. Left to wonder. No one would ever get anywhere if they just gave up when things got hard, and that's what The author is trying to prove. The studies of Venus are extremely valuble, so why would they quit without trying to find a solution. Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents.","The advancing of technology is unstoppable. When the driverless car is fully driverless, it will be revolutionary. That's why I believe that driverless cars are a great thing that will be fully added to our world one day. The driverless car could benefit the people of this world in many ways, it conserves gas, it's more safe than other ways of transportation, and it would cost less. One very important thing about the driverless car is that it conserves gas. The world is already in a mild gas problem as oil is a nonrenewable resource. This is because the people of the world use way too much gas every day for driving. These cars would use half the fuel that cars today use. That would make the price of gas go down and it would help our gas problem and make gas last for many more years. Driverless cars will be extermently safer than the cars we have today. I say this because it would cause less accidents. Let's say that someone had a little bit too much to drink but he or she is still alert enough to drive. Instead of taking the risk of crashing, he or she can get into the driverless car and only control it at a few moments. There would be a way less chance of he or she crashing and would make the roads way safer for every one else. The driverless car will save many families a ton of money. Instead of families buying their own car, they can call a Google driverless taxi when they need to go somewhere and not have to worry about the cost of gas. They also wouldn't have to worry about the price of buying a new car. The only places that would be losing money out of this is car dealerships. When the driverless cars become mainstream there wont be much need for car dealerships or even man driven cars. Driverless cars are going to be one of the biggest inventions in human history once they break their way into the mainstream. They would help out the world in many ways by conserving gas, making the world a safer place, and it would save familes a ton of money. When driverless cars are finally released to the public, the lives of almost every body in the world will be improved. ","Cell phones are a big part of our society today, but students have problems with bringing them to school and using them whenever and wherever during class time. If not told when and when not students can use their phones, students will use them at anytime including during class and study time. Policy one is a superior choice because students will be able to bring their phones but only use them during free time, there for putting a halt to interruptions during class time. This way students can actually learn and are not worried about texting friends in the middle of class. If you also take them away during study time students can study for a big test they have coming up that week. If policy two was implemented students would ignore the rule and bring and hide them anyways. Students would not pay attention because they are too busy trying to hide the fact they have a cell phone out during class time. Study time would no longer be ""studying time"" and it would change to ""texting time"". Students do not always follow instructions, of course you will have some that do, but a majority of them will blow it off and do whatever they like. Both of these policies are good choices however, more people would follow instructions if policy one was used, of course not everybody will follow directions, but a majority will. Policy one is the better choice for principals and students. That way everybody gets what they want.","Dear principal, I strongly agree that students should take a position in community service. I agree because everyone should want to live in a safe environment and if we don't stand up and clean up our communities who will. I don't only think that students should do community service but adults should also. Another reason why we should perform community service is because it may be your little brother or sister that may need tutoring . For those of you who don't think you should participate in these services your wrong. Community services are not just time consuming, it serves its purpose. It isn't like your doing it just to be doing it, your actually helping someone. I know that the person appreciates what your doing because your taking your time to help the and that shows a lot. These are my reasons why people should enjoy and take some time out of their day to help someone because one day you may need help and the person you said no to might turn out to be the person that helps you. sincerely STUDENT_NAME, ps. someone who cares.","Have you ever seen Europe?

Reason being is because what's the point of voting if they won't listen and they only hand pick a few people out of the millions of others. But keeping the College would make it easier to have votes counted. Initially, the point of voting is to be heard and to have things your way for once, but if it's falling on deaf ears, then why bother? For example, in 'The Indefensible Electoral College' writer Bradford Plumer states that, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Okay lets say someone wanted to vote for the Republican, and they vote for one of the electors who pledge themselves to the Republican. We can't rely on a person's word. What if they change their mind and vote for the other? How can natural citizens know to put their faith into a random stanger. Clearly, the voter does not get a say in the matter. Furthermore, the millions of people who vote are reduced to a small amout of people. ""The Electoral College consists of five hundred thirty eight electors,"" and ""Two hundred seventy is needed to decide who's president."" - The Office of the Federal Register. So states like New York and Nebraska only have three to six people voting since they are small. While on the other hand, California, Texas, and Florida have about thirty to sixty. And with the civilians living there, it's still not enough. Honestly, it wouldn't even matter if they voted. On the other hand, the smaller amount of people, the quicker the U.S can get a president. In paragraph 4 of 'In defense of the electoral college' it's replied that, ""A tie is possible... but it is highly unlikely."" The presidential vote in 2012 may have not been a landslide ,but at least it wasn't a tie. The small amount made it a lot easier to count the votes. And the majority of voters still got who they wanted ,so it wasn't all terrible. The electoral college hasn't all been bad. The Electoral College has more cons than it has pros. A citizen's voice must be heard and that won't happen if only few people are heard. But votes can be counted faster if there's only a tiny amount.    ",,,,,,,
634,220,"- Car Free Cities- Cities in Europe and parts of the United States have taken a new trend, car free cities, this may be weird but the amount of good that comes from not having cars is increible. Cars cause a greenhouse gases which are really bad for the environment. Limiting car usage has many advantages and can help everyone. A place known as Vauban, located in Germany has over 5,500 residents and only 30 percent of them own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. People said that they lived much better lives without a car in (source 1), smog and toxic car feums don't clog the city air allowing it to be free for people to walk outside and smell the fresh air. Some cities even enforce not to drive, such as Paris if you drive through certre areas you will be fined 22-euros ($31). Enough smog clear after people saw they were getting fined. There are some areas of the United States where greenhouse gas emissions are 50 percent, not only does this cause health related problems but also the it effects the environment, to help this the ""Environmental Protection Agency is promoting""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act."" This means that bills will be past to have certin areas have cars reduced. This increible idea really helps everyone and will help the future, some say its the end of the car culture. Different bills are being passed to help communities reduce emission of the gases that come from cars that effect the environment and certin health problems. Such as New York, they started a new bike-sharing program. Some people within the ages of 16-21 have started new proritys and  have organized themselfs to not need the use of a car. This is a prolong goal to help the environment and people, to create a better future. ""The excutive chairman of Ford Motor Company. has laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.""(source4) Even car companys see the cars are bad and want change for a brighter future. Limiting car usage or even no cars at all only have pros and is a very good idea for people who like to plan a good future and live in the suburbs. Cars are bad for the environment and should be reduced to help out.    ","It is vary dangerous to explore it because because of the extream heat and the high pressurebut i think it would be worth it. I think it is a vary interesting planit because i would like to know if there is any other life than what is on earth. I dont think that earth is the only inhabbited planet. In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author says there are valleys, mountains, and craters. I think it would be nice if they could think of a way to explore venus but i dont know if that will happen because we might not be advanced enough. If we where able to get on the planet with out dieing we might find out that there was life on it or there might still be life on there that had to adapt to the envierment. There are alot more planets out in the univers we shout see how far we can get. We might find other planets with life on them. I dont think we should just focus on this one planet. All they are doing is waisting recources on one planet that they could be using on other panets.","Imagine this, your in school all day. Your tired and ready to go home, but then the principal say that you have to stay after school. Everyone has to say after school . Now knowing that your tired and ready to go home you do not think this is fair. I think students should not have to stay after school for extracurricular activities for, some students may have homework or chores to do at home, students will have less with their family, and over-working the students may cause them to start being troublesome at school. The first reason why i think students should not have to stay after school is that students may have work to do at home. Many teachers give out homework for the students to work on, or they have chores that their parents have assigned them to do for that day. For example, a student has homework for three different classes. On top of that he or she needs to do dishes, walk the dog, and help cook. If he or she was told that they have to stay after school, he or she would not have enough time to do all for the work for that day. The second reason why is that students will have less time to spend with their family. Students already spend many hours of the day at school. This already leaves them with only a couple hours to spend with their families.(Not including time spent on homework and chores.) Going off of the example i used in the last paragraph; this is another example using that student. This students average school day is about seven hours long. Now if we take about home long it takes to get ready and the bus ride home it is about nine hours. This students take about two hours to do homework and two hours to do chores. That about twelve hours spent, leaving the student only with two hours left to spend with their family. Adding extra school time would give the student less time to spend with their family. The last reason I have is that over- working the students may cause them to become troublesome at school. What I mean by this is that some students might start falling alseep in class because of lack of sleep from over- working the previous day, Other might stop coming to school, or start to plain out disrespect teachers and school faculty. For example, a student might have been a straight a student always listening to the teacher, to his or her's work, and never fell behind on assignments, but they start falling asleep in class because of the over working the day before and stop listening to the teachers, and starts to fall behind on the school work that was assigned to them making them fail classes. On the other hand making students stay after school might benefit them. Some teacher may think that some of their students need extra help. So staying after school may help these students, or some student are very athletic, so if they stay after school for a sport it would help them lose of the energy they have and calm them down. But i think not all of the students should have to stay after school because it just is not fair for all of the students to have to stay after school. In conclusion I think that student should not have to stay after school for, Students will lose family time. Many student would have homework or chores to do at home and need the time to use at home. And over working the student may cause them to be troublesome.","I think the idea of being able to see other kids emotions or feelings from a computer is a bad idea. No one should know what the kid is going through unless that kid wants you to know he or she will tell you. If the kid wants it to be private or can't tell anyone anything then they don't want others to know at all. If they are mad they shouldn't take it out on someone else. They could maybe ask a close friend or teacher or parent for help or ask them what they should do. He or she could be going through a lot at home or with grades or a bully that makes he or she mad. Parents need to ask there kids and wonder are they doing ok in school is everything alright if there kid is showing emotions for being mad or sad then they should be concerned. Most kids will be to scared to tell others cause they think they will get into trouble so they just stay quiet. Some kids take the pain out on there selfs and harm there selfs or worse. The kid shouldn't be asking what to do cause they are to scared. The guardian, teacher, friend or someone close should be asking them are you ok or im here for you then the kid will speak up and talk. My opion on whether the computer should read kids expressions is no that's the parents job or guardian computers don't run are life's and the guardian should know if there kid is doing ok or not and help them instead of a computer helping them on there life situations.","Driverless cars? A car doing all the driving for you without you having to touch the wheel is of lazy. Why would you want a ""smar car"" do all the work for you. The more that the technology develops the more things people find to help you be more lazy. It's like people don't want to do anything themselves anymore. When driving you really have to pay attention to not just yourself but other people. If you let the smart car drive you around it's not going to really be paying attention to other people. If you get in an accident and the other person gets hurt, who is to blame you, or the car? The cops will go with you, because you are an human being that can get arrested and pay insurance, not the car. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" So, I don't think we should have driverless cars. I believe there would be more accidents than there is now. When it comes down to it yes, this will be our future, but we can also prevent it from happening. Its all up to you.","If I were Luke Bomberger I would convince people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it's such an experince. When you are doing your job not only are you working, you are helping other people and it gives you that good feeling down inside. As you are doing you rounds or trips or whatever you want to call it is a great opertunity for a young boy or grown man to see alsorts of stuff, like different cultures and different countrys. Another reason is your an animal lover you got yourself a job but remember one thing you do need to be strong and tuff. If you are worried about being board trust me we have loads of stuff to help you pass time some of the stuff includes, Table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games so you dont half to worried about being bored. There are some great dangers about being on sea. On my second trip I served as a watchman . My jod was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night I was makeing my hourly report to the captin and I slid down the slipery ladder and landed on my back side. I was happey to be alive. The one problem was that I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. You shouldent have that problem. Well thats realy all I can say. Yes I agree it dose have its downfalls but thers more good things than bad I can personley tell you that. It realy helped me open my mind to the world. It helped me understand the problems other countries were facing and I realy hope it helps you open up your mind. With all my information I hope to see you at sea helping the animals.            ","To begin with, I strongly believe that phone shouldn't be used while driving. The reason I say this, is because using a phone while driving can be a big impact on us today. For an example, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident, Georgia is a hand free state and lastly it's a distraction. First off, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident. The usage of phones is way too high to be used while driving. Did you know teenagers are having accidents because of these phones? The death rate went up because of using a phone while driving seems to be more important than our lives. Another reason why phones shouldn't be use is because Georgia is a hand free state. You can end up with a glove department fool of tickets because of this phone problem. Now you have to come out the pocket to pay this ticket when you could have obeyed the law. This play a large roll because you can't stay of your phone to save lives. This play a large roll because the law is trying to save lives. Last but not least, the phone is a huge distraction to the people who is driving. I say this because I seen it with my own eyes that a phone can distract a person. In the blink of the eye you might end up swerving around a car or probably worse. Also this can be prevented if the diver ignores everything on the outside. I mention this because if the diver does this the death rate might decrease. In conclusion, driving with a phone can have a large impact on us today. Also driving with a phone is a dangerous game to be play at any age. Why phones should or shouldn't be used while driving?                      ",,,,,,,
634,563,"Many probelms that our world is facing right now are pointed back to car usage. Problems such as congestion, high levels of smog, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in many places are all discussed in these articles. These days people can't get see themselves going on with their life without a car but in places such as Bogota, Columbia they have a set date called ""The Day Without Cars"". The day without cars is a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.(paragraph 20) Many people in Bogota choose to hike, bike, skate or take buses in order to get to work or wherever else they need to be. Some Colombians even enjoy it, such as businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (paragraph 24) In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" places such as Vauban, Germany are even giving up the usage of cars. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"". (paragraph 2) A media trainer and mother of two in Vauban named Heidrun Walter described how the change to not using cars has affected her in a positive way when she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" (paragraph 3) Experts say that automobiles have a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. (paragraph 5) When places like Vauban begin to reduce or completely end car usage, the greenhouse gas is also reduced and helps to reach the goal of a more healthy and clean society. The article ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog,"" Talks about cities such as Paris that have tried to forcedly ban driving. The reason for doing this was in hope to ""clear the air of the global city."" (paragraph 10) Even though there were many who did not participate in the ban of cars in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. (paragraph 14) Not only did this effort of less car usgae reduce congestion but it also reduced the level of smog in the France. For many people cars are just an excuse not to exercise. For example, someone might say ""Why should I walk when i can drive?"" or ""Why should I bike when I could take a taxi?"" People are so busy and caught up in work and being the best over everyone that exercise and physical condition are the least of their worries when really, it should be at the top of their list of importance. If someone decides to walk or skate to work everyday they would be in a healthy state of being and not have to worry or stress about finding extra time after work or school to exercise. If car usage is limited, our community would be drastically more healthy, physically and mentally. The amount of car usage has a great affect on many things in our community and our world. Car usage affects not only the pollution in our living conditions but also our mood and for some people, their happiness and stress level. The limited amount of cars also forces us to seek different forms of transportation that are not all motorized. Without cars people sometimes choose to walk, bike, skate, or even run to where they need to be. Not only does this improve our pollution problem but it also improves our physical and mental health. Limited car usage has many advantages and could make a very positive impact on our world.                                            ","The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It is important to study Venus because it is simular to Earth. It is closest to Earth by density and size. It is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore Venus. Venus is simular to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans. Venus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Venus is also are nearest option for a planitary visit. It is dangerous to be on Venus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric oressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to. NASA is trying to find out things about Venus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close and they think machines will help them do that. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is simular to Earth. Venus once had oceans like the Earth does now. NASA and scientists are looking into possible ways to explore Venus. This exploration will help find new facts about Venus.","Have you ever felt like you don't know anyone or don' t really have a hobby? Extracurricular activities can change that. Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom. Firstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world. In addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars. Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time. In conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation. ","Making Mona Lisa Smile In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human motions.

Also imagine a world were there would be barley any car crashes,less acciedent deaths,and aslo more relaxation when driving. That sound like a pretty good world to me. Driveless cars would be a good idea beacuse it will give the future a terrifc public transportataion system. Also the dirveles cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer alot more reliability than a bus. Driveless cars would drop the killing rate in the world. I say that because there are alot of car accidents that happen where some people dont make it. Inside a driveless car there would be special touch sensors to make sure the driver keeps hold of the weel,GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vechicle is an danger to keep the driver alert,aslo the driveless car would announce when the driver should be prepared to take over the wheel. The driveless car would be a great, and safe improvement to the future. Automakers are still continunig their work to make the driveless cars to reach all limitations for them to be apporved.

Pretty smart. Wrong making your way around places without using your phone maybe you need to use a GPS of some kind. That's ok but just to sit there talk on the phone while driving even or texting/on ft. Not very smart for many people a lot of accidents happened from texting and driving or just having to look at your phone period. Cell phones are perhaps the single best technological item for the average person. While they serve a purpose of connecting us to social networks, the question must be raised as the overall impact of cell phones. Due to crime rate. Currently when so many people use them, cell phones are bound to influence daily life, even on things like crime. Due to increasing crime rates caused by the U.S. economy. Addition to a lot of crime rates and ascendants being more safe than sorry is the best way to go if you ask me. I tell my mom a text can wait when driving it's our beautiful lives at stake every time we get in people drive over the speed limit and everything do not care this world is always in a rush for work or school or something they must get to on time people take their time sometimes and be very cautions we shouldn't have to.

But you had to send that little text message quick and all that other person on the other line were going to say a simple yes or no. Being better safe than ever with anything you put your mind too. Although smart phones are fun and magical they are dangerous too especially in the car. Not knowing your surroundings because you're on the phone and driving could cause multiple problems for yourself and other be careful when driving.

634,901,"Limiting Car Usage Cars have no doubt become the leading mode of transportation all over the world. Due to the amount of exhaust that they give out, there is a negative effect with greenhouse gases. Many places in the world have become very polluted due to the pollution that the cars give off. Did you know that Paris, the beautiful city we all know and envision in our minds was once so air polluted that they had to ban driving!? Only certain vehicles were allowed on road at times and eventually when things cleard up they let people back on the road. Vauban, Germany. A little suburban town that has given up automoblies altogether! ""Im much happier this way, when i had a car i was always tense,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two. Bicycles have become a part of their daily lives and as a result, resteraunts, clothing stores, grocery, and other shops have all sprung up on the streets in walking disatnce making everything easliy more accesible. The town itself is very clean, since they don't use automoblies the effect of pollution is drastically different. In Bogota, Columbia-There is a program  that they do every year called "" Car-free day ."" Car free is a day in which everyone in Bogota..you guessed it, doesn't drive. The people of Bogota care for their enviorment and see a need to take a day out their lives to try and improve it in the slightest. Their determination of upholding this tradition has even brought in someof the neighboring countries to partake in this car free event. The United States is one of the leading countries in the world for car pollution. Peaking in miles driven in 2005, President Barack Obama took a stand. President Obama set high goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that the yearly average of miles driven is decreasing and it is believed that if this trend continues, it will benefit the rest of the country. Cars are a majorform of pollution in the world we live in today, if we all just took some time out of our lives and rode a bike to work one day, or walked to the park, we might be able to stall the slow defeat of our planet. People desrve to live in a clean well taken careof enviorment and the first step to making that enviornment the way which we desire..is you.                    ","In the article the author tells that even though there is alot of dangerous challenges in exploring venus and that he is willing to face them challenges.

In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems. I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. ","Have you ever felt like you don't know anyone or don' t really have a hobby? Extracurricular activities can change that. Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom. Firstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world. In addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars. Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time. In conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation. ","I feel that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not very valuable. Even though I feel that this new way of technology is pretty cool. I don't think that it is something that is really needed in a classroom. In paragraph six Dr Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or boerd,- Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"". This may help the instructor greatly with teaching, and being able to know how their students are feeling. But, I think that as a teacher you should be asking questions, and making sure that the material you are teaching is being understood by all your students. And if it is not, you should find a way to help your students understand. You shouldn't depend on technology when, it is your job to know when the students are becoming boerd or confused. So, that you can make your classroom a better learning environment for everyone in the classroom. Sometimes even though it may not be the best thing to do, students like to keep in their emotion of how they are feeling and don't want the entire classroom to know it. This new way of technology could be a great addition to a classroom for experiments once in awhile, but shouldn't be a major part of the classroom.    ","I believe that driverless cars should be developed. It may be true that some of the people and states go against driverless cars. But, people are making driverless cars improve everyday. With every new type of development there are going to be positives and negatives. The positives of the driverless car is that it can drive by it self. Also the driverless cars alerts the individual thats driving the car if he or she is in danger. The negatives about driverless cars is that it has lots of improvements to be made. For example,if the alert system didnt work while you was 15 seconds from a accident and the car was driving you in someone got hurt who would the police blame you or the manufacture. But, even with these error I still think driverless cars would be very helpfull. Some of the ways a driverless car could be helpful to a individual driver is on roadtrips. The reason why I said this is because road trips are very long. So even if you fall asleep while driving the car the car is doing ninety percent of the driving. So you should still be safe because the car is driving on its own. The only problem is that you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. But most people who fall asleep while driving always keep there hands on the wheel. So I dont think people keeping there hands on the wheel will be a problem. In conclusion I believe in the development of driverless cars because once the cars are fully developed I believe these cars will bring more positives than negatives. This is why I believe in the development of driverless cars.","You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The program will allow you to experience many different adventures and go to many unique and eccentric places. One time my friend, Don Reist, and I went to New Orleans after the Pacific War had ended. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and we headed to Greece with the cargo of 335 horses with enough oats and hay to feed them. That was my first order, and I had fun. The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, such as myself. Besides getting to help others, I had the side benefit of getting to see Europe and China. When I first went to Greece, I saw the Acropolis. I had also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. See, there are many adventures you can take on side of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. One time when I was going to China, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings always kept me busy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luckily for me, helping my aunt Katie out on her farm as a boy had prepared me for hard work, just not for the dangers of the sea. As another example, if you had the experience I did of helping on the farm you have been slightly prepared with hard work. One dark rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot my feet torward an opening on side of the ship. The only thing keeping me from falling overboard into the deep, dark, and dangerous Atlantic Ocean was a small strip of metal along the edge. I was really happy to still be alive. But, I couldn't work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs. I'll admit it, there some dangers working as a Seagoing Cowboy. But, the people there really look after you, and they care about you. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Participating in the program opened up a whole new world for me. I am really grateful for the opportunity. The program helped make me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.                 ","Cell Phone Use While Driving It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment. Often times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones""). Many states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time. In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.

634,923,"Limiting car usage will be very important in the near future and can be very deadly for the enviroment if not we do not conserve and reduce car use. Using a car is expensive for everybody because think of if you get into an accident and it was your fault you have to then pay for your car and the opposing persons car. It can also be a health hazar where if you live in a big city with lots of running cars then it can be dangerous to be breathing in all those chemicals and you might end up getting a diseas or condition like maybe cancer of the lungs or bronchitis. To begin with, the expenses of a car can be very high and very low, depending on where you stand on it. but if you ever get into an accident and its your fault and you have to payoff the other person and also pay for your car to be fix (if it hasnt been totaled). Payment of cars can kill you though maybe you wont have enough to pay your electricity bill for your apartment or you cant pay for an oil change so your car is useless now and you are still paying to have it look pretty even though you cant even pay for the oil to be changed. To continue, think that you`re living in a big city like new york or chicago or philidelphia. Now think of every single car in that city. Alot right? well every single one of those cars do the same thing they just are used to get to point A to point B. well think of all the gas that car is pooring into the streets by just sitting at a red light. now can you see about another couple hundred thousand doing that at the same time? its pretty bad right? all that gas and chemicals hits the streets first then you can smell it from your 4th story apartment and then its stuck in there for hours. think about how bad that is for your lungs and all your senses. Im no doctor but id say that its pretty horrible and maybe even cancerous. just think about that before you dont limit usage on your car! For a conclusion, id like you to remember that cars are not just transportation but also chemical exhausters that have the effect to kill any man or women of any age. So maybe just maybe if you limited car usage you might be saving a life and also not spending to much money on your car and more on bills to be saving your own life cause water and electricity bills are some of the most expensive bills out there. Liting car usage is important and we all need to be like the town of Vauban in germany.    ","In this passage the author states that, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". The author believes that trying to find more intel about Venus is going to help the human species in a positive way despite all of the dangers that we may face on the journey. I agree with him on this 100% and let me tell you why. The author says in paragraph 2 that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of its distance away size and density. This means that Venus is not too far away from us and with it being so similar it would be extrodinary to find out what other similarities we have with Venus. If I had a twin I would want to know more about him as well. Not only is it close in size, density, and distance it also may have been layers with many oceans and various forms of life as well, which the author states in paragraph 4. The author also states that Venus also has many of the naturally formed structures that Earth has such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Since Venus is closer to the sun it is a lot hotter then the surface on Earth. Scientist did say that although it may be very hot it is still survivable by humans. This means that Venus could one day be a living quaters for the human race. The author says that NASA wants to take a ship and hover it around 30 miles or so over Venus' surface, this will give us a little bit more insight on how Venus actually is but not too much on the surface. Because Venus has a thick cloud covering its surface its hard to get light to get through and not much will be present to the naked eye. This just furthers the authors claim to try even harder to figure out a way to reach Venus' surface and find more information regarding the planet. As you can see the author did a fantastic job at supporting his claim about our further research of the planet Venus. He gave us examples of what we have done in the past as well as what we could do or might to in the future. He also supported his claim by giving us reasons as to why we should future explore this vast planet. In conclusion, I am convinced that we should invenst in the futuring of research for this fascinating planet Venus. ","Do you think students should play sports? Yes! I agree students should play spots. Students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology. First,sports will help students with they health. When students play sports they have to move around a lot and drink a lot of water. However when students drink a lot of water and move around a lot they can lose weight. Also students will want to eat health food and not junk food. Sport will help out students with health problems. Next,sports keep students out of trouble. Students will want to do good in school and get good grades to play in the games and to stay on the team. However if students don't keep the good work up they not going to be able to play in any of the games and they will no longer be on the team. Also if students play sports they will stop skiping class and fighting. Sports will keep a lot of students on track. Last,sports will help students stay off technology. Now days all students do is play video games and sit on they cell phones. Everything that students do today is on technology. However if you look up how many students that play sports it's only 90% of students in the world that play sports. Students need to stay off technology and play sports more. In conclusion,sports is something that every student should play. Sports will help students in a lot of ways. I agree that students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.        ","I think that use of technology like this in classrooms could be a dangerous prospect. Many things could go wrong with technology like this and could have some major consequences. First teachers could end up losing their jobs. All of this stems from what has happened in history. Take factories as an example, factories used to be full of people making and producing everything, but the recent surges in robotic workers has left many without jobs that would have otherwise been a great livlihood. This same thing could very well happen to teachers with little to no warning. Second off there are people that are affraid to have cameras or video monitors on their children because they are known to have been hacked into and can lead to crimes including kidnapping and robbery. Adding this sort of computor facial recognition software could increase hackability of a schools network or technology. Sometimes hacks can go undetected for days or weeks at a time and once you find out it has been happening it is suddenly too late. Finaly it would be a huge change for everyone that is currently enroled in pulic schools. Once you reach students above grade 4 it could be a struggle to get them on a different ""type"" of learning such as a computor program that can mold the lesson to a persons emotions. You also lose a sort of connection to the teacher. Most people remember certain teachers for certain reasons, whether they were funny, told stories, truly cared about students, or were just overall a great teacher, but all of this would be lost because no computor at this point has TRUE intelligence, some may mimic actions of intelligent life but none has achived it yet. Adding this sort of program to schools could be extremely dangerous in many ways. People would be at risk for losing jobs, school-wide hacks, and a true emotional and phisical loss.","I'm a hands on type of guy so, i'll disagree with the Driverless car. Because, If we dont have to get up and move around to get to our car all we will have to get is wake up and go to your kitchen and make food. With the Driverless cars everone in the world will become very lazy and if we are lazy other places that dont have these cars can attack us. I'm starting to drive myself and about to get my licences in a couple of month and i love driving with the window little bit down feeling the nice wind and look out the front glass. What if a animal jumps and hit the car who is going to fix up the car, Its self? No, We will have to fix it up so that will mean more autoshops and less gasstations cause the car uses less gas then any other car in America. What im trying to say is that driverless cars will not be good for us or anyone that uses it, google has a reason to us them, but they said it isnt fully driverless so that means the car needs us as much as we need it to get us places. Cars are like peoples other son/girl. We take care of it like it was a living person. But, it isnt ment to auto drive, yes i like the auto breaks when something jumps in front of you and it will save your lifes time by time, but a fully driverless car is too much.","I think that you should participate in the UNRRA because of these three reasons. It helps people around the world that need help, It is really fun and you get to go to diffrent spots in the world and see the amazing things. If you were caught up in a big mess in World War 2, I bet you would want people to help you out. If you participate in the UNRRA with me and a lot more other people, you could help those type of people. Think of all the lives you could save and help. It would be really fun to do this because after you do our work, we play games like table-tennis tournaments, fencing and boxing. We would also read books and do whittling. All of those things are really fun. If you come with us and help the people in need of things, you could see awesome things like the great wall of China. You would go to France and see and hear Big Ben. All of those places would be awesome to see and if you help us, You would get to see it for real and not on a picture or something. I hope that those three reasons will make you want to come participate with me and many other people to help the people in need.    ","Human beings have invented some amazing technology, one such example is the smartphone this device plays a role in the daily life of everyone who has one, whether it be for communication, GPS, or even paying for store bought goods, however should these same devices be used while on the road? The answer to that is no, a smartphone offers too many distractions such as social media, games, videos, and much more. This is evident by recent laws such as the hands off law, which prohibits drivers from touching their device while driving. This is also evident by car accidents caused by one or more drivers being too occupied by their smartphone. With this being said, smartphones are definitely a hazard while used on the road. Social media when used on a phone can be a wonderful thing, it keeps you in contact with friends, family, and even your fellow co-workers, however, it can also be a major distraction. As humans use social media chemicals in their brain are released, these chemicals are called dopamine, and in humans it's what makes us decide we like whatever we're doing, thus a habit is formed. This habit if not controlled can lead to constant checking of a person's phone, including when in the car, which could lead to catastrophic accidents and even death while on the road. This and the added distractions of potential passengers could create an even more dangerous environment. Gaming can be a great hobby despite what people say, this includes mobile games, but they can also be a great distraction on the road. The same chemical mentioned earlier is released when you play games, it's what makes them entertaining, and for some people it makes them need that one last level on Candy Crush or to complete that one last quest on games like Clash Royale. Some people decide to do this when driving, once again endangering their fellow drivers, as well as any passengers in their car. This helps prove the point of smartphone use shouldn't be allowed in the car because there have been plenty of car and motorcycle accidents due to this. The more people want to do something, the greater the release of dopamine is when their craving is finally fed. Some people like to play videos in the car while they drive, while that's ok for some people to do, there are still exceptions to this. People who have low attention spans as well as people who like to pay more attention to the video rather than the road are more likely to crash than someone who just plays music from their phone in the car. The reasoning behind this is simple, a music video is more likely to be watched than someone simply opening a music streaming app and playing the song. Other people like to watch movies or just normal YouTube videos adding to the risk factor. This all leads to the hands off law. The hands off law, as mentioned earlier, outlaws the use of any type of cellular device while driving, creating a safer environment for all drivers. Some people may ask, ""What if the police don't catch everyone who uses their phone while driving?"" That can only be helped by us humans putting down these devices while on the road, while there are laws in place, not everyone follows them, and officers can't always catch everyone. This leads back to the starting statement, no, smartphones should not be allowed while people use the road, because as human beings, no matter who you are, you can still be distracted by your device.

615,220,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to learn in the comfort of their own home, without having to transport to a private, or public school. This may be convienent for parents who work on a busy schedule, allowing them to choose when and where they want their chilldren to learn. Although online schooling my be beneficial to some children, it may harm their future. With this being said, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because they wouldn't develop social skills, they would have a hard time creating relationships with others, and they may struggle from lack of motivation and depression. To grow as an individual, it is essential to surround oneself with others. This is because it allows individuals to develop skills that may make or break their future. These skills are called social skills, and they should be developed as a child. Social skills are important for student development because it allows them to communicate with the people surrounding them on an every day basis. Schools were intended to bring students together, allowing communication with one another, which is why it is so important for students to learn in grow in schools that are not online. Social skills may also be one of the biggest things a student can learn in school, and this is something that online schooling does not offer. Communicating with one another will allow students to work and learn together, creating relationships on the way. If students are not surrounded by others, they will have a difficult time creating relationships and friendships with others. Relationships play a huge role in almost everyone's life. Whether their romantic, family oriented, or friendships, they are an important way to grow as an individual. Students who attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing may find it difficult to create relationships that are not family oriented because they are not surrounded by other students every day. While students who attend online school are in the comfort of their own home, students that attend schools outside of their home are comforted by the people surrounding them. This is why students who attend school outside of their home have a major advantage, which is developing relationships. Students will also get a sense of who they are and what they like when engaging and developing relationships with other students, which students who take school online will not be able to do. Most students find joy in creating relationships with others, so they are excited to wake up every morning for school. Those who aren't able to create bonds with others may lack that motivation to get up every morning, which may take a toll on their mental health. Students who attend school beyond the comfort of their own household may have more motivation to get out of bed every morning than those who take school online. This is because the students who are enrolled in schools may look forward to getting out of the house and seeing their friends every morning, while the students who are enrolled in online schooling have to stay in, isolated from things beyond their household. This may cause harm on the mental health of the students taking school online because they may feel excluded from the world around them. Feeling excluded from the world around them may place a sense of loneless in their life, which may lead to depression. Students should be surrounded by others as they grow so they can maintain a healthy mental state, and be happy. Critics may argue that online schooling has a positive impact on students because if they learn in an enviorment that they feel most comfortable in, then they will be able to absorb more information on a daily basis. They may also say that it is more managable for busy students, and that they can work their schedules around education. However, students who learn at home all their life will suffer from a lack social skills, and will have a hard time fitting in in the real world. This will cause them to have a major disadvantage from the students because they will have a difficlut time communicating with the people around them, which will definately have an impact on their future. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because they wouldn't develop social skills, they would have a hard time creating relationships with others, and they may struggle from lack of motivation and depression.","All students want to enjoy their long awaited summer vacation to the fullest. Schools; however, feel that it is necessary for students to complete summer assignments to ensure that they do not forget what they learned over the summer. With the help of these projects, students will be better prepared for the topics that they will learn in the upcoming school year. The schools entrust the duty of designing these projects to the teachers because of their experience, but that does not mean that they know how to make the projects fit for the students. Knowing what works best for the students is up to the students and the students alone. Summer projects should be student designed because they will have more interest in their work, they will learn to be more independent, and the students will have a less stressful break. Some argue that summer projects should be teacher designed because they know much more about the course than the students. An English teacher, that will be teaching students about the Age of Reason, assigns her students books that were written from that time and reflect those ideas. The books chosen by the teacher will help introduce her students to their new course. However, the students have no interest at all in the books that were assigned to them, and they have no will to read them since it is summer break. It is painful to finish a book that one is not interested in before a deadline. Their summer is ruined by pushing through these books, but if the students choose their books, they will be more inclined to read them. Summer projects should be student designed because the assignments will be more interesting for them to complete. For world history class, the students assign themselves a project to write about any event in world history and show its significance. By choosing their own event, the students can figure out what topic interests themselves the most. The project is not designed to work best for the entire class, but to be specific to the interests of each individual student. The students understand each other the most, and they know how summer projects make them feel. They know how to make summer projects more productive over the summer. The for people to design projects will help them become more independent. Summer assignments should be student designed because they help students become more independent people. A student is given the opportunity to create his projects meant for him during the summer, and he learns to complete work specific to him all on his own. When the project is designed by the student and for the student, that is the only person that knows how that project should be completed. He alone reaches success through the process of designing and finishing his own work. By creating his projects at a young age, he learns to rely more on himself, and he will become much more successful in the future. When the project is designed, the students also plans it to create a less stressful summer for themselves. Summer projects should be student designed because their summer will be less stressful with assignments that they know more of. A student decides to write an essay on the impacts of the Roaring Twenties, her favorite time period, so she is able to plan when which parts of the essay will be completed and go at her own pace. Since she is the designer of the project, she understands how long the essay will take her. She enjoys working on this essay more because it is a topic that she likes, so it will not feel like it is work to her. Her time will not be spent dreading the assignment and stressing over a deadline all summer; rather, she will have more fun and work with a more relaxed environment with a project meant for her. Assignments created by the students for summer vacation are more beneficial than assignments made by the teachers because students will be more invested in their projects, they form more self directed lives, and experience a more relaxed vacation. With projects that draw the attention of the students, they do not feel that it is work that they are just being forced to do. Their designing of the projects gives them the same benefit of learning without the cost ruining their break. It is up to the students to take the responsibility of advocating for this change in summer assignments. They can gain the support of their fellow students to reach out to their county Board of Education through letters and board meeting to express the need for change.","Alien comics are the real deal? The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off. First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable. Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space. Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business."" Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions. In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement. ","I believe that in this passage Luke becomes a seagoing cowboy and travels all over the seas and Luke really wanted to see China and Europe, Luke takes trips all over and thye author of the story chose Luke and showed us what Luke did as a seagoing cowboy. Evidence from the passage to support my answer is the author talked about what Luke did as a seagoing cowboy. Another peice of evidence from the story to support my conclusion is it was World War II and it happened in Europe duing that time so Luke helped his friend out and helped him with saving people with food and money and also, a shelter. These peices of evidence supports my conclusion by being stated in the text. Reasons to join this program is it can be a be change in life to help needed people out in different countries. Also, there could be a country you really wanted to go to and that program is going there so you could go sightseeing at that country.","To the principal I'm writing to you on account of the idea requiring all students to do some community services. Personally I think that is a great idea, it helps students see the importance of helping out, and that it can even be fun sometimes. In today's world few people see the importance of lending a hand, so if the school would teach them the importance I believe more people would start to understand how important it is to do community service. One reason I believe that community service at a young age is necessary is that in order to get into collage you most often need to have some sort of community service on your records. My last reason is that in today's society work is not a well liked word. I'm being raised on a small farm of 14 and a half acres and I know the importance of work and how it is beneficial, to earn a job in today's economy your student      ","Dear Principal, You are changing the school policy so students have to have a grade B average in order to participate in after school sports or other activities. This will not allow people to interact with others, get in exercise, or have any free time from school. What your doing is a bad idea. How do you expect students to interact with others if they have no where to go after school? If this happens students will loose friends or not see them as often. Students would struggle in school because they would no one encouraging them to do better. Having friends in and out of school is very important. Another reason is we would loose exercise because we would have no where to go. After school sports and activities are helpful because it allows students to stay in shape and stay healthy. They would have to stay at home doing homework and trying to get there grades up. This means they will start gaining weight and eating more. Having free time from school is very helpful. It relieves a lot of stress and allows you to get school off your mind. Free time lets you hang out with friends and family. Also it allows you to go outside and be interactive, and healthy. If you have to worry about grades all the time you become stressed out and up tight. Sports allows you to let out all of those things. These are all ways that hurt students during the school year. No one can have any fun at sports practices or games because they won't even be allowed to play. And kids won't be able to participate in other activities. From, Student","Driverless cars, Whats my opionon on them, and some supporting details. Well first off, i dont really care if they are made or not, it's not my money or time being invested or devoted into them. Now i wouldnt say they are a good idea, but i will say i think they are a really cool project and concept, and i do and know they are out there. Do i see issues with cars that can guide or drive themselves? Yes, i do, but did anyone see cruise control being a thing when it was first invented, i dont think so. Some major issues i see is law suits, and such when they are invloved in a accicent, such as who fault it is the driver or the computer, and what you can do if it is the computers fault. what if it kills someone? who gets blammed, and who goes to jail for the crime. What if the driver of the self guided car gets killed in a stand alone accident? Who knows. I also see a issue of them releasing the car, and they'er being alot of unsolved issues, fatal ones, so i think it should go threw major and long and extensive testing, during snow conditions, dirt roads, high ways, city streets, alleys, sand, mud, tempture testing, impact testing, and long hours testing to make sure this thing is almost faultess, and insures safety for everyone. I also see the benefits of this car, such as allowing the driver to relax and pay attention to other obstacles, and unseen objects etc. I see it allowing cars to hold lanes better, maintain safer speeds, and stopping impacts before they happen with the right technology. i see it making a incoventent travel more convenient, and making simple life task even easier then they were. It could also cut down on the careless drivers. I do think it's a neat idea and a cool project that needs alot of time, and developement, but i dont wan't all human task, and responsibilties taken away. I don't wanna see the world turn into nothing, but robots, and automated machines. I want to see cool things, that are fun, and make life a little bit eaier, but still allow us to have do do things. Thats just my personal opionon.    ",,,,,,,
615,563,"Generic_Name Less than a couple decades ago, all students were either going to an actual school building or were being homeschooled. In both of these environments, students had to use textbooks to learn the subjects and a notebook to study the notes you wrote on the subject. Now almost all the information the world has to offer is at the palm of our hand. Technology has developed so rapidly in the recent years that students are able to complete classes and even get a degree just by having a computer and internet access. Taking classes online from home is exactly the same as taking classes at a school, but students who take their classes online at home are able to have less distractions getting in the way of their learning. In almost every class at a school, assignments and tests are taken on a computer. This being said, online classes taken from home and video lectures are really no different from what is going on inside a classroom, but they do have one big difference. At any school, there is always going to be drama. There is always going to be teachers that you fall half asleep during their lectures. There will also always be the chatter of your peers while in a classroom too. The big benifit of the students taking their classes from home is that they will be in their own comfortable environment. There are not any other students making lots of noise. Most of the time there isn't really a teacher actually teaching students the lesson, rather students will read the information to themselves, making them have to focus on the subject at hand. Students will most likely be able to concentrate more deeply on their learning and be free from the distracting school environment. This gives the students at home more potential to retain information and have a greater understanding of different concepts than the students who attend a school. Students taking classes at home would also be abe to benifit because they can take the classes at their own pace. In most schools, some teachers just talk way too fast or way too slow; Sometimes students can not even comprehend the teacher's hand writing. With having all the information right on a computer, students are able to choose whatever pace is necessary for them to learn the information in their classes. As a result of the flexible time, most students will have the information stay in their heads, making tests and quizzes a lot easier to finish in a short amount of time. In conclusion, online classes can help students who get distracted easily by the traditional school environment. It also gives the students more potential to have deep understandings of material due to having a flexible learning schedual.","The distinct responsibility of having students learn rests on the very shoulders of teachers throughout nine out of the twelve months that are in a year, so the students should direly be permitted to design how they learn over the three month break that they get. This three month break, summer, to most students, is a time where they can finally let go of all their responsibilities and worries and leave them right in the classroom. Most do not think twice about what they have learned over the past semester, but instead are already steps ahead on planning what events. attractions, and/or vacations they may embark on. Teachers still try to make an effort for learners to still store information they have learned and even try add on to it by assigning projects that are aimed directly for students to complete by the next school year. More often than not, projects are long-term, and that causes the student to be continuously involved with the material and truly grasp the knowledge coming at them. Summer projects should be student-designed due to the fact that they are more likely to retain the knowledge, it lets them express their creativity and uniqueness, and finally they would be more inclined to complete the project. When a student does a project that is created by them, they have to think outside of the box and really put an effort to make a project that caters towards themselves. Every student will be likely to design a different version of the project and there will be no barriers to how they can let their creative minds visualize the project and ultimately complete it. Having them let their brain-storming abilities to take over and conceptualize on how they will continue to tackle the task at hand, truly sets them up for active learning and teaches them very useful future skills that they will use. Varying on the topic, students can create physical projects such as posters or tri-folds, or they can create online projects such as graphs or tables. Having the ability to express your mind is something that can not be so easily undermined or the very learning that is so emphasized in today's educational system will have failed. To actually learn an individual needs to be able to understand the knowledge that is going through their mind as they work on assignments, and there is truly no better way to learn than to self-learn while working on a project. Unlike tests or any other sort of assignment, projects give students more of a chance to actually learn rather than just memorizing knowledge for a sort period of time and then forgetting it the second they turn in the assignment. Making sure that their mind is continuously being subjected to complete the assignment over a long period of time consequently burns the knowledge into their brain and helps them to better retain it. Having students do the designing portion of the assignment as well would lead to even more learning due to them needing to know the content first and then being able to correctly complete it with no errors. Having the responsibility of creating and then completing an assignment can only lead to more mind involvement which would lead to learning and would ultimately lead to retaining. Producing the best possible work can only come through the prosperity of motivation and the willingness to do the work. Students often look at summer assignments as needless work that a teacher wants them to complete for a grade, but if they were to honestly enjoy the work they were creating and completing then their effort would truly be expressed through their work. Having that passion to finish and be proud with the work that they complete is the leading factor for high grades, and also causes high amounts of knowledge to be learned. Trying to just rush through an assignment made by a teacher can be dreadful, but when doing a student-designed project they must take their time and fully comprehend all that is going on in it. People such as Bill Gates can be a perfect example of displaying this sort of passion and then having their work speak for the amount of effort they put in, or else Microsoft would not be one of the top companies in the world. Being able to learn and retain knowledge, express themselves in countless ways, and want to actually complete the assignment are all reasons why student-designed projects prove to be more resourceful and efficient in the life of a typical student. However, teacher-designed projects are helpful too, they teach exactly what the teacher would teach them in class which gives learners an understanding of the content from the teachers perspective and could possibly give them knowledge on material they do not know. Learning is retaining, if the students do not retain any of the knowledge they are just trying to complete another teacher-given assignment, and they are not truly learning. Summer is not only a time of fun and enjoyment, but is also is a time for students to get a step ahead and continue their journey to pursue their dreams, which can only come from one ability, learning.","The face was not created by aliens for many reasons. An example would be how NASA wanted to take a picture, to reasure the American people. If it was created by aliens NASA wouldn't want to be taking pictures of it. Also it wasn't kept a private matter, NASA wanted all to see the face. Anothere example would be how NASA went out of there way to prove there cliam. Mission controllers stated that ""it was not easy to target Cydonia"". ""In fact it was hard work"", NASA stated how they didn't pass over the face very often. The last example would be how NASA took the picture a such high quality for the people. The article states that the team used maximum resolution for the photo. Back when the first Viking photo came out the quality wasn't as advanced as it was in 2001. I think the quality of the photo helped the American peole to understand NASA's cliam. After all was said and done NASA said the photo just shows a butte or mesa which is commonly found in the American West. That's why I think the face wasn't created by aliens. ","The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program waiting to happen. I'm Luke and at first, I was unsure about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, but now I'm sure I've made the right choice! Many don't truely know what the Seagoing Cowboys is. During World War II, many animals were sick and had a scarce supply of food in Europe. The UNRRA decided that the needed a special position for horses and cows. That is the Seagoing Cowboys. Some people may wonder about the experience and commitment of the Seagoing Cowboys. It is an outstanding experience for anyone! I get the daily benifit of seeing sights in Europe and China like the Acropolis in Greece. I've also rode a gondola in Venice, Italy! What else is on your bucket list? In addition, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China! Any sea lover or animal lover should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It took a few weeks to travel on the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast to get to China. I attended to the animals and feed them in the ships. Many people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is no fun, all work. You are wrong! We play activites like baseball and volleyball in empty areas. We always enjoy the competative nature of table-tennis, fencing, and boxing when we are off work. Any readers would love to join, as many Seagoing Cowboys love the places a story can take you. Games are a jolly part of any off day with the team. Also, the experience is even more exciting when you bring a friend. Sure, all of the Seagoing Cowboys are your family, but a friend makes the family even closer. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is one of the most rewarding things that has ever happened to me. I believe anyone should be a Seagoing Cowboy if they want. This experience made me get a better grasp on what other countries (and not to metion the animals) need. I hope that ou will be a Seagoing Cowboy because, it is ""hays"" (days) full of fun!","Dear Principal; Community service is a great way to help out your town. There are many things students can do as community service. Students can help elementary school students who need help understanding a subject. Trash liters the school yard and many other public places, making the town look awful. Also, community service can teach children to be responsible. I think all students should be required to perform community service. Many children in elementary school need help to understand their math homework. However, there are 30 students and only 1 teacher. It would be very hard on the teacher if they taught the lesson then every student has questions or needs help. Older students from middle school or even high school could volunteer to go into the class and help out the teacher. Even if they only go once a week for an hour it would take a tremendous load of the teachers back. Schools are a place where trash is easily found blowing around in the wind. It liters the town, making everything look dirty. However, it can easily be fixed. When students are required to perform community service the easiest thing to do would be to pick up trash. Picking up all that trash will more than likely convince the students to stop dropping their trash everywhere. They will learn that it is better to throw it away the first time than to throw it on the ground to be picked up at some later point in time. Students think community service is a waste of time and in no way can it benefit them. However, they are wrong. By performing community service not only will the students clean up the town, they will get an immense sense of accomplishment. Plus, students can receive community service hours, which help them increase their chances of getting into college. Many people feel that community service takes too much time away from what they want to do. I feel that they can just do one hour a week and it will benefit tem greatly. Community service is arguably the best way to help your town. It not only benefits the town, it benefits the students, the children being helped, and the teachers. The people who are currently performing community service find it a great way to pass time and make new friends. They think helping the community is very important. If you require every student at your school to perform at least one hour of community service a week, the results will be astonishing. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, Eighth Grade","Dear TEACHER_NAME How are you doing today? I hope every things is ok. I have herd that you want to change the policy to play a sport now you must now god a B average in our classes i stead of a C average. Well i don't want to seem rude I find this to be unfair. You may ask why and say you did this to bring grades up? Well as I see it is hard for student to hold a b average in all classes. As you may know struggle in Vocabulary. One semester I got a C+ in this subject. I did the best i could do in Vocabulary and my best was a C+. Some student are determined to do the best and sometimes there best is a C. I fell that for some student iit will be hard to hold a B average in there classes because they struggled to much in this class. For example i help RELATIVE_NAME in math. The first semester he got a F in math so he was no able to play on the basket ball team and the team need ed him. So i decided to help him in math. The second semester he got a C+ in math. To me that is a big leap he went from a F to a C+. I fell that he made he did the best he could and found the rode of succeed. He loves to play basketball and would be crushed in he would have to have a B in order to play. In his min he will be heart broken and feel that his goal was not worth it and not do so good on his report card the third time around. He will be dismayed with his work and grade will drop in the school I am part of the on the school basketball team as you know and some kid have been kicked on the team for grade and have brought their grade up to C+ and they are back on the team. If you bring the average to B it will effect our team and we will not be able to play in the championship match in three weeks. the team will have to forfeit and we have worked very hard. We have played both academically and sport wise trough out the year and to loose what we have been working hard will make us tear up and I personally will not give it my all in school. TEACHER_NAME i beg you not to change the policy it will not hurt the student body but hurt you more. Why do I sat this? Well I fell that th student body will be mad at you for taking our way to learn discipline respect and the love for our sports. We ill not be able to build the foundation for a strong morals in our hearts, minds and souls.","Driverless cars may be coming in our future, but they most likely will not be commonly used. Driving a car run by a computer allows a number of problems to occur. Since 2009, driverless cars have been around. These cars are only considered driverless under certain conditions though. If the car is not reliable in all traffic conditions, people should not rely on them to get them where they need to go safely. Society today relies on technology and computers for almost everything from talking to friends to sending military signals hundreds of miles. At times, even the most advanced technology glitches. Driving a car that is controlled by technology would pose the same problems. Would the car still drive if it started raining? What would happen if the rotating sensor on the roof glithched? A driver, assuming the car is driving, may not be attentive and see the signal given by the car for the human to take over. The car could crash causing even bigger problems than just faulty technology. Crashes occur even when human drivers are in control of the car. It is inevitable that crashes are likely to happen in the autonomous cars as well. Paragraph 9 states that, ""in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" If these driverless cars are better than having a human behind the wheel, most states would allow them to be tested. Even if they were tested and allowed to be driven new laws would have to be put into place. In the case of an accident, would drivers or manufacturers be at fault for the accident? Drivers might claim that they did not see the signs that the car gave them signifying that the human was supposed to take over. Manufacturers would argue saying that the driver was unattentive to their surroundings. Drivers who rely on computer driven cars may loose the skills needed to drive a car over time. If they do not drive in favorable conditions, because the car is driving, how will the manufacturers expect them to be able to drive in hazardous conditions. Practice makes perfect; without practice, a driver will not be close to perfect. Switching to cars being driven by humans in times of unstable conditons could potentially cause more accidents. Driverless cars might sound like a fantastic idea. When the different risks are taken into consideration, a human life should be more important than not having to drive. The reliability of the autonomous cars is not strong enough at this time to be considered safe. Humans should keep driving cars and computers should stick to sending text messages.",,,,,,,
615,901,"Have you ever thought about what students could do with extra time on their hands? Students would benefit from online learning because it would be easier to focus, they would have more free time, and it can be used when regular schools are not available. Online school has been considered recently and could be coming very soon. If it happens, we could see if it really benefits students in as many ways as we think. Having online school could be a short term solution or as a permanent solution. During school, many students can lose focus due to the amount of time they spend in school. By having online school, the usual 7 hour school day would be shortened because of the limitations of online school. Spending 7 hours in school tires the mind and with online school, students can work at their own pace. Students would work better in an environment they are more comfortable with like their bedrooms. The added benefit of being able to take a break whenever would allow students to sleep in instead of having to wake up early in the morning. Having online school would give students more free time for other activities like sports or hobbies and would remove the stress that comes with school. With free time on their hands, students could do other things they normally would not be able to like apply for jobs, practice sports, and spend time with friends. Students that work or are involved with sports do not have much time to complete assignments and can discourage students to take excelled classes. This limit of time can be stressful for students and many students end up staying up late in order to finish. By giving the students more free time to work or practice sports, students would be able to complete their work on time without stressing over it. Online school can be used for a temporary replacement for regular school in times of emergencies. Students who are unable to attend school due to disease or injury would be able to keep up with the class through online learning. It could prove useful during times of disease outbreaks like corona virus. Instead of keeping schools open with a risk of infecting students and staff, schools would consider switching to online school for as long as it is needed. Schools could consider using online learning to make up for snow days as well. Students would benefit from online school because it would be easier to focus, it would give them more free time, and it could be used as a temporary replacement if needed. Having online school temporarily or permanently would benefit students and teachers alike. The amount of time saved by using online school instead of regular school would be huge. Schools would not have to spend nearly as much time as they do teaching students. The amount of time cut and the mental benefits it would provide for students would be very beneficial to their health and to the way they learn","Summer is a students time to relax and take a long break from the chaos that endures during the school year. This break is normally for beach trips and days at the pool with ones friends. Although, some schools make students complete projects over the summer to make sure they stay sharp and are prepared for the more difficult school year that lies ahead of them. These projects will either be designed by students or by a faculty member of the school district. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work. The first reason students should be the creators of these projects is because students know students best. When a teacher designs a projects sometimes they do not always know how kids will respond to the assignment and how that will effect what they are learning. For example if a student is excited for a project they are going to be more willing to finish it and will be more excited to learn about the material it is on, and students know what they like best and are able to create these assignments that will work in their benefit and will make them enthusiastic about what they are doing. Which in turn will make the project more effective towards their education and will end up helping the teachers. All in all, students know what they like best. Another issue is with facility giving out these projects is they can sometimes overdue what they are giving out. This meaning students will be able to give out a balanced schedule for the other students to complete. For example they will have a set amount of work for two weeks and they will have deadlines within the break. This is not saying teachers cannot do this but students will be able to provide a fair amount of work for the others to do without the students feeling like they have too much to do over a short period of time. This will also in turn make the projects easier to digest for students and not overwhelm them when the time comes for them to start it. The final reason it would be better for students to create this projects is because a lot of the time students feel that teachers give out work that is not necessary. I have seen this happen all of the time, teachers give out work that does not feel like it is helping with out education but there just to keep us busy or ""busy work"". The elimination of this work would be very beneficial to not only our time but our feelings toward the project and our eagerness to finish it. If we feel like we are doing work that does not benefit us in any way it does not make us enthusiastic about what we are doing and will only make us go into the school year feeling hostile that the teachers made us do that work. If students were creating the projects they would be able to almost eliminate this work entirely and keep it to only what we need to do. If a student feels they need more practice on a certain topic they would be able to provide that practice option without having everyone else do it if they do not need the practice. In conclusion, if students were able to create these projects they would be able to reach the other students in a way that a facility member would not. Once again, students know students best. With students making these projects we would be able to change the feeling toward doing school work in the summer from a negative to possibly even a positive if done correctly. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work. By the students, for the students.","People from the NASA think that aliens built the face on Mars, but actually it is a natural landform. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it llook like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled tthe image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store chechout lines for 25 years! But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located as 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fac, it's hard work. "" Mars Global Surveyor is mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often,"" he noted. What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common aroud the America West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face on Mars.""","Hello,my name is Luke Bomberger and i'm going to talk about the Seagoing Cowboys program. First i'm going to say how fantastic it is being a Seagoing Cowboy. Even though you go on a ship that takes one month to two months it worth the wait getting to the designated area. You can think how many people or animals lives your saving by just becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Imagine going places you never imagined going, like Greece, China. You can also go see places like a excaved castle in Crete even the Panam Canel Even if the animals have to be fed and watered two to three times a day it's still worth it. You will be tired from pulling bales of hay and bags of oats even stalls had to be clean. There is good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy like when your on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We had tabel tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. I hoped you liked what i said about being a Seagoing Cowboy because i loved being at one. I hope you sign up and become one to, thank you.","To the principal I'm writing to you on account of the idea requiring all students to do some community services.

Some people don't get B's or maybe some one didn't go to school that day and have to make it up some other time. plus some people don't have any thing better to do than play sport. Playing in sport is also a very good way to stay in shape. Some people are new to a school and don't have very many friends and sport can do that for them. I think that it's a bad idea to do not let people to join sport or activities because some people cant do as well as other can, or maybe they got sick for a long time and it's very hard to make up all the thing that u need to. Like test and homework and some times it hard to keep track of it all. Some times it can also mean that the person doesn't care about there grades and mabe the activities may keep them up. Its good to keep sport at a lower grade so more people can join. But some people join to play for fun. Some other may join to stay healthy and fit. But keeping the grade to at least a C would allow student to get involved in things that there friends are in. It would in courage people to have there grades up and stay in the sport or activity. But it will also help with peoples social skills. the person would also make friend and more and it would bring up the persons self of steam. the reason why i feel strongly about this is i was always going to new schools and i kinda shy so i don t talk","People are always interested in looking in the future. Now, driverless cars are becoming more interesting to people. Yes , they do have negative aspects, but they are a great idea. This will help deduct nearly half of the usage of fuel we use today, a bigger help on the public transportation buisness, and is a new fun way for drivng, so people will be interested in buying these cars. Today, we use so much amout of fuel. This is bad because one day the supply will run out. These smart cars are a great way to help save fuel and save money. In the article it says, "" the cars he foresees would use half of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"". With a regular car you would continously pay for gas, but with the smart car, its great on gas. With the help of these driverless cars, public transportation will be so much better. The article states, "" a future with a pulic transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system"". With the help of these transportation systems, people could save money by not having to buy a car or having to waiste money on gas. Also, they are more flexible than just riding the bus. It can take you directly where needed and back to where you came from. This would be a great help. Though these cars are expensive to make, its a fun way to drive and safe. This means people will be interested in getting a car that drives its self. This is not only giving the buisness money so they can make more vehicles, but its making a drivers life a little more easier. It says "" we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. some manufactueres hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays"" This allows the person to be entertained which will satisfy them with their car, but it will notify you when you need to take over the driving. The smart car brings both benefits and negative aspects but there are many great ideas and things these cars may bring. They help with public transportion, the usage of fuel, and the car makes the people interested in buying it which helps bring money into the economy and buisnesess. These cars will ""fundamentally change the world"" as said in the article. It is a great idea and people are looking forward to better models of a self driving car.

615,923,"Beep. Beep. Beep. Oh no that's your alarm clock. You have 20 minutes to rush and get ready for school before you miss the bus, again. You can't afford to miss the bus because your mom already left. As you hurry out the door you remember you didn't eat breakfast. ""Oh well"" you think, you rarely eat breakfast anyways. Once you get to school, loud noises and stress about your English project fill your head. As you go throughout the day, all you think about is that glorious bell that rings at 2:10 on the dot to save you. Then you'll finally be able to go home, just to do this all over again the next day. Public school has created an environment filled with bullying, stress, and does not benefit students who face learning or mental disabilities, but online school could be a solution to these issues. Every student who has been in a public school has had the thought, ""What if they don't like me?"". Bullying and discrimination have become so normalized in the school system all across the country, to the point where students feel there is no one to go to. Everyone must fit into a certain standard, or else they are considered ""weird"" or get left out. If you don't have the latest shoes or wear your hair a certain way, then chances are, it's going to be hard to immediately fit in. We were taught as kids that it's OK to be different, but is it really? If you dont find a clique to fit in with, no one will take you in. School has become less and less about learning, and more about the ability to make people like you. You can see it as soon as you walk into a public school. Girls wearing clothes they hate, but do it because if they don't, they won't have friends, and boys playing sports that they don't even like, all so they'll fit into a group. The need to feel liked by your peers has taken a large toll on student's mental health. Many students dread going to school due to the hate as soon as they walk into the building. With online school, students will never have to fear hate from their peers again, and be able to be at peace with what they choice to wear and do. Did you the math homework? Oh and the history project? What about the 5 page English essay? The science lab, did you finish it? An average high school student takes 7 classes, with only about an hour a day for that class. So to fit in the information not covered in class, teachers will assign homework every night. Every teacher will tell you homework shouldn't take more than an hour. Now multiply that hour by your other seven classes. Students already wake up at early hours every weekday just to go to sleep at late hours due to homework. With online classes, these unfair hours won't affect students. The option of waking up later and being able to spread out your classes will help student's stress levels tremendously. There will be no more rushing to do your homework on the bus or not wanting to go to school because you and your teacher don't get along. With less stress on students backs, grades could possibly be affected positively and students will feel happier about the idea of school. Public school was built on an idea that every student is perfect, but that is in fact not the case. Not every student has the mental or physical capability of sitting in a brightly lit classroom for an hour at a time, listening to a teacher drone on and on about a subject that does not interest them. Not every special needs student is properly diagnosed, so they're seen to be ""dumb"" by their teachers and peers. Students with things such as ADHD are not benefited with how the school system is currently setup. Their brain structure just does not allow them to sit and focus for an hour at a time, seven times a day. Many students are athletes, and with athletics come concussions. Many concussed students are told by medical professionals to not go to school, yet they still have to, because if they don't, they fail. There are so many setbacks for many students in the current public school system, that online school should be an easier option for them. Students with learning disabilities will have a better opportunity to pass, without fearing judgment from others. Students with focusing problems can now space out their classes and be able to move around as they learn. Students with medical issues can learn from the comfort of their own home and do as the doctor informed them to. Online school can create countless opportunities for students who need them most. Bullying and stress in public schools can finally be ended, along with giving students with learning disabilities new advantages. Online school can now reach out to students who were feeling as if there was no hope left. It can hopefully improve grades, and increase graduation rates. There will be many more students wanting to go to college and create new jobs and career options. Online school can make a great impact on our future.    ","School just got out and the students finally have time to relax. They realize there is school later in the year, but forget about that, it's summer. In order to keep the students mentally sharp for the upcoming school year, they are given medial and mundane tasks over the summer to make sure they can continue to perform at the top of their game. Students often complain about how boring the assignment is, and they have a point;the summer assignments are often way too specific or require an immense amount of creativity to put together coherently. The task of summer projects is to continue learning even when school is out and thus the job to design the summer assignment should be in the hands of the teachers. Although students would perform better if the summer assignment topic was something a little more relevant, the point is to learn and maintain a standard. If students could teach themselves, then there would be no purpose of going to school. A trend currently is the degradation of students and their worsening grades. If those same students were given the choice to either write a teacher's prompt or their own prompt, all of them would write a terrible paper. There would be no incentive to trying as the student can write about a topic that is nonsense and get away with it. Teachers direct and guide students to learning new things, and they set the standard for the years to come. Students are fed up with school at the end of year, and now they have the free time to do anything they so wish. Their brains are not in the growing mindset;instead, they are thinking about the next parties or road trips. A student designing an assignment in their head might sound good to them, but in reality, it tends to turn out very poorly structured or lazily written. Students cannot be held accountable to remember every single detail of a particular class to be able to design an assignment especially in the midst of their summer fun. The last reason that teachers should design summer assignments is grading them. They understand what the assignment should roughly be about. They know the differences of a terrible, average, or great paper. It would be impossible to fairly grade students if they all submit completely random and baseless papers that are not comparable to each other. The teacher should assign something that allows all the paper to have a consistent threat throughout the paper. Having all the students connected to a single topic helps prevent students from going off the rails on their assignment later on. Overall, those that can teach in school should be able to design something to teach outside of school. Education is not about the satisfaction the student can derive from it, but the brutal reality of how well they can understand. With more students failing, it is the teacher's job to raise the bar and help those students work to get there. Lowering the bar creates a positive feed cycle;students will become worse and worse as the amount of effort required plummets. Teachers should design the assignments that best suit their students strengths.","I think that the face on Mars is fake because on the day of the original photo the wheather was foggy and the camera had to see through the fog, I also think it is fake because the face was aproxamently 2 miles long which is a verry big rock, the last reason I think it is fake is because the pictures taken were verry bad camera and on lt had a little amount of pixles. The face on Mars is fake because on the day the face was first seen, outside was verry foggy. This means that the cameras would have to see through haze. However some still thought that the face was made by aliens, even though it was winter and in bad wheather. Then later we took a picture of the face on a clear day and didnt see a face. This makes me think that there has never been a face on Mars Another reason that I think that the face on Mars is fake is because the statue was to be aproxamently two miles long and maybe even longer. This makes it seen unreasonably tall. If the face were to be two miles tall then that would mean that many of the other rocks would be smaller, but they are not actually the surrounding rocks are much bigger. My last reason that I think that there isnt a face is because our pictures arn't the best. The cameras that took the original picture took 43 meters per pixel, and the camera that took the picture in 2001 made a pixel every 1.56 meters. This leads to the fact that no face had ever been found on Mars. Only the camera made it look like a face. I think that the face on Mars is fake because on the day of the original photo the wheather was foggy and the camera had to see through the fog, I also think it is fake because the face was aproxamently 2 miles long which is a verry big rock, the last reason I think it is fake is because the pictures taken were verry bad camera and on lt had a little amount of pixles. The fog made it nearly impossable for the camera to take a clear picture of the mountain on Mars. The face was also suposed to be about two miles tall which means that this mould be a verry big rock, but the rock besides it is much bigger then it. The old cameras that NASA owned were bad compared to what the more modern pictures were taken with. In conclusion everyone now needs to know that the face found on the mountain is fake.                                        ","I am going to give you reasons why you should join the seagoing Cowboys program.1 you should enter cause you can go to different countries and cities. We also get to help people who were in the war and their town so that's a lot of fun. When you see the smile on the people's face it makes you feel good. Another reason you should join is cause we get to get on boats and feed and water animals,but it just takes so long to get to our destination. Its really fun if you are at home helping you can help here we need any and everyone who wants to help. There can be bad days where lets say you are on the night shift so you fall and break something. Well that means you can just sit down or try to help somewhere else. There can be bad and good days but mostly good outs here you can have so much free time cause we are on the boat a lot. Sometimes we go to countries who just had fought a war so it's just nice to go and try to help them recover. This offer is an opportunity of a lifetime you won't have as much fun anywhere than here.","I think students should be required to do community service. Its a great way to appreciate the Earth, but also a good way to teach. For example, some students may like to go outside and get involved. Its a new experience of studying. Personally i love doing hands-on work, such as projects and building things. The advantages are helping the planet and doing things for others. It makes an individual feel like they achieved something, it makes them feel good and have courage. community service is a great way to learn. You can get more involved, outside of school. You can get to know your neighbors or, who knows, you may just be a natural and open a window to a new career you never would think of. It'll give us knowledge that may be necessary in the future! Students should always keep an opened mind and take risks. Even if they don't like ""helping"", they should at least try it out. They wont know it, until they try it! Now there are only a few flaws with this. For one, if its winter and you go outside, students may not like the cold weather (not likely), or maybe some students would not like the subject, or idea, of actually getting up, working and moving. Some may think its too boring or they don't want to tutor children. Doing community service may take time away from doing homework or take time away from activities we do outside of school Overall, it depends on the person if they volunteer to help their community. But, I think its a great idea and we should do it. It'll be a new experience that'll somehow make me wiser and apply that knowledge later on in life. STUDENT_NAME      ","School Sport Policy To whom it may concern: The recent notice of changing the policy about students participating in sports must have a B average instead of a C average is a wonderful idea. This would cause student athletes to be more responsible, and think twice when it comes to stupid decisions. First off, students that want to participate in a school sport would force them to get better grades to do something they love to do. Students would try harder in there classes versus the student athletes who get so-so grades and are missing assignments. Most student athletes do well in school anyway so they wouldn't get major affected by this change. Secondly, this would make the student athletes think twice about making stupid decisions. for example it would most likely make the student do there homework every night. Also it would make some student athletes think twice about ditching school Some people may argue that this new policy would put stress on student athletes, worrying about how they have to get good grades. That is what school is all about, pretty much if you do your homework every night, listen to instructions, and come to school every day, i guarantee you student athletes wouldn't have to worry about a thing. In conclusion students with at least a B average will be able to play a sport versus a C average. This would make students think twice about some decisions. also it would teach student athletes about responsibility. If all student athletes did all what there supposed to do, they WILL play sports.","If I was asked to go for driverless cars or against it, I would be against it. Yes I know we're at the point when technology is used for everything, but I believe that the use of technology can be harmful to us. I'll give you four reasons why I am against driverless cars. It will affect our skills about cars, how it's function. Second, teenagers or anyone won't learn how to drive. Third, it might be dangerous because of the weather. Fourth, the driving laws can be changed. If we had driverless cars, how are we going to learn or know about them? We can't always learn from technology. There is going to be new engines and everything, but I bet we can't learn about it that quickly. It took more than 60 years to understand this cars. We cant just throw all that away. How are we going to teach teenagers how to drive if we have driverless cars? We won't be teaching them nothing, except to just put itself to drive. I bet teenagers want to learn how to drive on their own or from their parents, without the use of technology. The weather can cause many destructions. If your car is destroyed because of the weather, you are able to fix it with different parts. It may be expensive, but imagine the new technology ",,,,,,,
719,220,"Have you ever though about what I'd be like if you and your fellow friends, neighbors, peers, and family members had a limit on the amount of car usage, and how much that could possibly benefit you later on in life? Think about what type of advantages of limiting something like this. Throughout world today, people have been wondering what is best for their country? Should it be alright to limited on car usage? Ever since the first car was created all those years ago, many people in countries throughout the world have had a strong love affair with cars. But has that love for vechiles stopped? For the most part, cars have always been a major cultural popularity in America, and a large variety of other divrse countries throughout the world, but has that love affair with cars, cooliing down? It's been said time and time again throughout that it has been. If we were to convert into a ""car free"" world would that benefit us in the future years to come? For the most part, cars have had many positive effects on the enviroment. It has also, had major effects on people throughout the world. Some countries such as Colombia have began to take vital action by banning cars from the road for onwe day out of the year. With only having taxis and buses permitted on all roads. Doing so would promote ""alternative transportation and reduce smog."" During this particular day many of the Colombians decide to hike, bike, skate, and do a variety of other fun activities as well. In the article,""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" -by Andrew Selsky Bogota it states, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from paricipating,"" says Carlos Arturo Plaza stated,""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollutin, "" as he stated while rolling down the street on his two seat, two wheel bicycle with his wife. For the most part, this day has benefitted Colombias enviroment and people darastically throughout the past couple of years, this day has even had more countries join this event. Countries such as Cali and Valledupar have also joined this event. Many believe that doing so has benefitted the Colombians tremendiously, and for the most part, it has. Sports centers, parks, sidewalks, and cities have started to boost up and bloom throughout the cities. For the most part, the culture of America has shifted shifted time, and time again. But through the past recent years the driving population of american citizens driving cars has decreased darastically. The question has been raised: Will american citizens continue to drive cars, and if so, will this be a positive outcome? In the past years the worlds most common cars that were in usage are known as the Model Tand the Detroit. But over the past couple of years these cars as well as many others have deminished in popularity of ranking.  In the article ""The End of Car Culture""-by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states, "" Different things are conversing which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and theDirector of Moblities Research and Polcy Center. she also states, ""The Internet makes telecommunting possible and allos people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Changes like this could have a darasticallly great effect on people later on. Likewise with all of these changes about car commuting would be decreed darastically. Overall, throughout the world their has been many changes that have brought on many positive effects. The advantages given to us throughout the years has allowed us to communicate, socialize, and do many other things more then ever before. We have been given many modern conviences that has been a priviledge to all of us. Limiting car usuage would even iumpact us more in the future. I we were to limit ourseleves in the near future on car usage the effects would be of freat influence in the years to come upon us.                                                             ","In movies and televison, driverless cars have been featured as an invetntion for the distant future. Automakers have begun to attempt the creation of driverless cars. There have been creations close to the driverless car but not exactly what people have been wanting to create. Driverless cars are a pointless invention idea and should not be developed any further. Companies should not continue to pursue the driverless car idea any longer. Google has tried since 2009 to make driverless cars and they have been close to making one. The cars that Google has made can, ""drive moe than half a milion miles wothout a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't fully driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"". The cars are not fully dirverless if they have to alert the driver to take over driving for a while through traffic. The driverless car should be independent and not need help from the driver on issues like traffic and pulling in and out of driveways. In 2013, BMW created a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" but not a driverless car, which is the goal not a car that can only help with traffic. Smart cars have lots of sensors that can help guide divers through difficult jams or passage ways but those sensors cannot function without some help from the driver. The smart cars made by BMW, ""steer, accelerate, and breake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" . Their cars are close to the function of a driverless car but still need more work to be done in order to be able to drive without humans. Since the cars today still have not been developed like the driverless car it is pointless to continue to try. Even though driverless cars can be helpful there are laws that prevent some people from driving them. It is proven that, ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars"" . Most states will not allow the testing of let alone the driving of driverless cars. If driving one of those cars is not even allowed, then what is the point of developing the project further? The driverless cars should not be created since barely anyone is allowed to use them. Even if there was a change in traffic laws, ""new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"". There need to be new laws covering the case of an accident about whether the blame is on the driver or the manufacturer. These new laws that would be set will take up time and could cause lawsuits. The technology in the car could fail and the someone could be injured and there would be the question of who is at fault. If someones safety is at stake then the car should not be made at all. The idea of making a driverless car should not be continued. The car is a pointless idea that does not seem to actually work and would fail. There have already been multiple attempts at making this car and all have come close but failed. The project should be ended and automakers should stop wasting their time on this car and focus on the other cars they make. ","I finally got everyones attention in the plaza, Now just to let them know.''Everyone can I have your attention! If anybody is looking for a decent job then please listen.

","Phones and Driving Phones and driving is a really big problem in today's society. There are many arguments' related to this topic. One of the major arguments is if drivers should or should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. We all have our different thoughts and opinions related to this topic. I personally think people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. There are many reasons why I say this It is very dangerous to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. There have been many cases where people get in accidents or die or even kill someone else because of cell phone distraction. Day by day there are accidents, majority of the time is because drivers are distracted and not focused in driving safely and checking their surroundings. Cell phones are now a part of our everyday life and as well as our vehicles. We can't get distracted so easily with our cell phones when we are trying to get from one place to another using a vehicle. People should always be cautious when operating a vehicle regardless if using a phone or not. In addition to this, drivers should really only use their phones for navigation only if they are heading to a place they don't know of. Our phones have a GPS and it helps us get from one place to another and I feel like that should only be the reason why we use our phones while operating a vehicle. This will help drivers stay focused and away from any other distractions. I believe that drivers should be aware that a call or a text can wait, and if it's a serious emergency they should pull over before risking a chance to have an accident or possibly kill themselves or someone else. Being safe is the first thing drivers should have in mind before and while operating a vehicle. Furthermore, there are drivers with a lot of experience in driving. Many people think they are good drivers but accidents can happen to anyone. Many teens start driving at an early age. According to the AAA the percentage of teens that acknowledge the risk of cell phone, use while driving is 94%. Although this is the case 35% of those teens admitted of doing it anyway. In addition, teen drivers are four times more likely to get into car crashes than adults because of cell phone use. They both have a risk and an accident can happen to anyone. Finally, I believe that every driver should always be cautious and have in mind the risk there is when it comes to driving. In general, driving can be very dangerous and especially if you are distracted with your phone. Distractions can easily cause an accident at any time and moment. There is always going to be danger on the road regardless how good of a driver you are. I think drivers can wait a few minutes to reply to a text instead of causing a tragedy and never ever be able to reply to another text message. Cell phones are in our everyday use as well as our vehicles, it is better to see an everyday rather than to distract yourself today and not see tomorrow. This is why I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while operating a vehicle.   ","Every day millions of children come home on a bus instead of staying after school, and for many, there is a very good reason. It seems to make sense, having everyone take a extra curricular activity, but in reality it doesn't work. Every student has a reason to go, or not to go to an extra curricular activity and some reasons are not just because of preference. Not everyone has a lifestyle that allows them to stay after school or do a sport, many of the students won't have a way to get home. The school will not be able to provide enough buses for these students either. There isn't even enough room in the current activity rooms to hold 78 kids, and the materials needed are to expensive. Having mandatory extra curricular activities will be a disaster because there is not enough room, it is to expensive, and students won't be able to get home. If our school system made extra curricular activities mandatory the first problem would be the amount of space needed to support the students activity. For example, there are almost 900 students in my school, This would mean in the 10 after school activities my school provides, there would need to be 90 kids in each one; That's enough to fill 4 classrooms. This brings up another problem, the school can't have 150 kids in one program and 10 in the other, so the school would have to chose the activity for us. Just that fact alone takes all the excitement out of the activity, just for reference, imagine the star quarter back on the football ending up in art instead, possibly destroying his or her whole football career. Most of my school's after school activities need certain spaces for the participants to practice and do their activity. For instance the robotics team only has one room with all of the vices, saws, and tools while the other robotics rooms will have students constantly running between the other rooms getting tools that they dont have in their completely different room. The cheer leading team will have to move to the gym to fit all the people, but so did the pep band, and basketball practice is already in the gym, but they could just go in the auxiliary gym which is smaller than the cafeteria, the problem with that is the wrestling team is already in the auxiliary gym. The school has no room to fit every team and all of the clubs. If Prince William County decided to make after school activities mandatory the schools would not be able to afford the materials needed for the programs. A dungeons and Dragons game along with all of the books and die is over 200 dollars, now imagining multiplying that by 7 just to afford the basics for the club. The robotics team pays around 600 dollars for each robot, and more for the competitions, now that program has to buy 15 robots and buy more slots at the competitions. If some how the schools were able to afford these expensive along with all other clubs, teachers, and staff salaries it would come from our local taxes. This would double our local taxes, but if the schools decide not to over tax the citizens of Generic_School than there would be no way the school could provide the gear and equipment for the school's clubs and teams. My school's sports gear is already worn out and our schools are in dire need of new equipment, but there is no way we could spend 7 times as much just to give everyone more cheap and basic equipment. while most kids in the school do not participate in a extra curricular activities because they don't want to, many students don't participate because they can't. On most days my dad gets home at around six so when my activity ends at 4:30 in the afternoon i have to take the bus. Currently my school has 2 activity buses, one for Generic_City and one for Generic_City. The activity bus arrives at my home which is 5 miles away at 5:40 in the evening, it takes the bus 1 hour and 10 minutes to drop me off at my home. With a direct route the bus would have to travel at 4 mph. There is no way the school can hire enough buses to work almost 12 straight hours a day. If the school really can't find enough buses each bus would have to make 70 stops. Many students won't be able to be picked up by their parents and will be forced to endure the 3 hour bus ride through a city with only 30 square miles of residential area. If our schools really made after school activities mandatory, it would be a disaster. One of the biggest issues with this topic is that in its simple form it looks like a great idea, but when you look at the details and what it would cause it shows the big mistake it would be. Giving every student the chance to do an interactive activity they enjoy would be incredible. Sadly, doing that in our current school system would cause all after school activities to stop going to competitions due to the over crowding; The students would not be able to pick their own activity and would be forced to do something they are bad at or just dislike. Making the activities would not only be a punishment to the students of Generic_School but to the teachers, the bus drivers, the custodians, the administrators, the taxpayers, and even our entire county's well being. In this scenario it may at first look like everybody wins, but really when you look at the real facts everybody loses. The entire mentality of school will become even more negative as students are stripped of their choice to do something they enjoy and taken away from time with their family. Although the goal of this rule would be to create a good learning environment and a chance to participate in more interactive learning experiences,our county administrators might fail to see the real outcome of this decision. In conclusion, enforcing after school activities will take away the last form of student's choice in our schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ","According to the article the Facial Action Code System i think is valuable to student in classroom's. I am for it because aacording to the text its tells you how great it can predict how your feeling. The article gives us a little information on how accurate it works numbers showing she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry it shows that the Facial Action Code System is an new way to figure out people's emotions. Also it says the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Also this new software can show a lot about your emotions for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Also i think its a good idea for students in classroom because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and your teacher could help you or could try to do something more to keep you from getting bored. I think from the articlke this would be a great thing to get and to start using because according to the text its a great tool to use in the future. ","Dear Principal, All students should be required to perform community service . If they choose to help our community then great, but if they do not, they need to. It is important to help our community so that it is a clean environment for us to live. If they do not help then our community could get dirty and be a great place to live and play. The kids that are helping the community now are doing a lot of work and need more help. There doing things like planting trees, picking up trash, and tutor kids and a whole lot of other services. These kids are very good citizens for helping and people thank them everyday including some students that do not help. The kids that do not help think that i takes up to much free time and they have better things to do. They really do not have better things to on the weekend, they go home and play video games the whole day. They do not even consider helping the community. So I think that you should require students to perform community service for at least a couple of weeks, to get the other students to thing about helping for a change. If you require it may get more students and their parents to perform community service also. So inclusion, yes, you should make in required, to get the students to help their community. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
719,563,"This was what the 21st Century looks like.. People using cars more and more every single day to the point where half of us don't even want to take a lovely little stroll through the garden, over the bridge, and straight to the tree house. Nope. Nothing like that anymore. Ever since cars were created, it's given us a form to transport easier, but it's taken out a lot from the people. Among all the things they could be doing, they choose to sit in the car all day. Not anymore. There are people in different countries and states who are making a wonderful change in the world. It all starts in Vauban, Germany. People have no cars within their non-existant garages and people are paying thousands of dollars to park their car. Why? Well, consider it as a way to help the environment. Places like Germany, France, and small sections of the United States have banned cars because of the greenhouse gas emissions.  With a law that prevents cars, the states and countries can clean up the air quicker without any more polluting gas entering to make things worse. One of the greatest advantages for car bans is that there are less accidents. With rarely any cars on the streets, it prevents people from dying in car accidents or hit-and-runs. With this, we'll have less deaths and more people coming home safely to their families. With the majority of the population gaining weight from no workouts, car bans puts us in a different track. Whenever we need to go somewhere, we do it with a bit of exercise. Walking, biking, all that sweet jazz. We can become a better generation with just a little push and removal of something that restricts us from certain things. We've taken advangtage of cars by not putting so much work into getting the strength we need to keep us walking for more than just 20 minutes before our legs grow tired. The future is close, but we've still got a long road ahead of us to get to our goal. To cross that road, we've thrown all the cars off to the side and we'll walk, we'll ride our bikes, we'll dance our way over the other side. Whatever it takes to get to the other side, we'll take it.    ",I believe that a driverless car would be benificial in the sense that if you cannot afford to fly in an airplane for long distance travel then you could use the driverless car. The only way you would have to take over for the car is if the situation occurs like an accident or heavy road construction. If you are driving to California or Florida for example it would be alot more comfortable to do so then having to drive all those long hours. You might also have to stop for gas every once in a while but that is acceptable. The benifits of the driverless car are endless. If a certain car company puts in a television into the center dashboard then the driver could move his or her seat back and relax and watch tv. They could also just sit back and enjoy the ride. Much better then having to drive a long distence thus running the risk of falling asleep or getting dristracted by a phone or something like that. if need be the car shuts off the tv automaticlly and moves the seat back in the set position and the driver takes over. The sensors would be able to sense something far down the road to give the driver enough heads up to be able to take control of the car in time. A luxury car company like Cadillac or Audi could also make the interior of the car more comfortable and more enjoyable to make the long distence drive more worth while then flying and going through airport security and all those lines when you could hop in a driverless car and jump on the highway and let the car take over. The car company would also have to make the car more safe if an accident were to occur. I would much rather ride or drive a driverless car then having to risk falling asleep at the wheel. We all know how dangerous that is. Thats a big problem for the U.S and the soulution is the driverless car. This i think would be a great idea for car companys and would make them alot of money. If they could make these cars affordable. There are a few draw backs to this car but i think its a great idea.  ,"I think that Luke should get back in the Seagoing Cowboys program,because then he can see the sea, and he like's to take care of the animals he get's different types of job's while he's there the problem is that he craked some ribs, so he wont be able to get back in the program for a while if it wasnt for his friend he wouldn't have been in the program at all I think that Luke really likes his job he gets to see the world as he is going around the world if I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I would want to stay because it would be fun to be able to visit new type's of places most of the time i would want to help the animals! because I would have to check up on them like every hour just like Luke he didn't know he was going to be in the program but they just told him what to do unitl he get's back he he just got done with high school and now he has to deal with the seas it seems like he wants to go back home so he can finsh his two job's and then he could go to collage either way i tink that he was a good guy in the Seagoing Cowboys progarm ","Today majority of humans own or use a cell phone. Most people may use it on a daily basis, when they at work, school, and home. People nowadays can't live without their phones. However, having a phone nowadays can be huge distraction to humans. People shouldn't operate phones while driving a vehicle because it can injury them, others thats driving. Driving can be very dangerous, when anyone's driving they have to drive for themselves and others. Driving can seriously kill someone so being on your phone while driving can be even worse. No matter if it's a text, injuring someone or killing someone is more important . People can check their phone if they stop somewhere , not while driving. Humans nowadays can't live without their phones. Majority of humans use their phone everyday and this may be a huge distraction while driving. Maybe like 80% of people are distracted while driving. They may not understand how serious it is driving while being on your phone can not only injury others but you can be in bad shape to. A phone notification is not worth taking someone's life or injuring someone. It's other ways people can check their phone notification. Things people can do to prevent them from getting in a accident while being on their phone while driving. They can use a google voice device to help send messages. Also they can bluetooth their phone to their car to answer calls. This can be a big help and much safer for drivers. Most people would be less distracted now. Overall, people should not operate their phones while driving. A cell phone notification is not that important than driving on the road. Anyone can be seriously injury by cell phone distraction so therefore it's not safe. It can be safer ways people can see their phone nonfiction. Driving can be much safer without operating a phone.           ","Are students up for the challenge of making a yearbook? I think everybody should participate in designing a yearbook. Making a yearbook could help the teachers out a lot, it could take less time to make it if everybody helped, and it'll make a yearbook full of everybody's ideas. Making a yearbook would help the teachers out a lot because i see teachers trying to take pictures of us to put in the yearbook and i think it would be fun if we did it! Teachers already go through enough in their day and they dont have a lot of time to just sit down and create a yearbook. I feel like we could take a stand and help out for once. The students and I need things to do, some kids have nothing to do. A group of us would take pictures around the school and the others would help create the yearbook after school. The teachers need a break from us and planning sometimes. All of us working together will accomplish a lot. There are hundreds of us at this school and we are a smart group of people if we try hard. There are a lot of pages in a year book and it'll take days to finish but we got this! My grandma told me yesterday ""hard work pays off."" It's just like Field Hockey, its a group effort. We all need to work together as a team. Every person in this school is different in their own way. If you take a very imaginary girls idea, or a very bold guys idea, and even just a chill persons idea; it'll all come together and make a beautiful yearbook! We could take our own pictures from our camera rolls at the school and put pictures in there, we would put paint in it to make it colorful, and we could take people's pictures for the yearbook. I'm a very creative person, i'm in art pause and designing things are fun to me! It could also get people to branch out and meet new people. My mom said to me ""you should help the school by doing something"", i never thought about making a yearbook but it seems like it would be fun! We could be helping the teachers out, we would take less time as a group, and all of our ideas would be put into it. Its good for the teachers because they get a break and good for the students because they can interact with people. i would rather do something and help out then do nothing!","I believe the ''Facial Action Coding System'' is a original idea that nobody has never thought of that till now. Teachers can know now when students are not really interested in a assignment or its boring. '' A class computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''Teachers need to know when a student is not feeling well. So you now not to push the students buttons. The students point of view is that it will be way more better .''Then it could modify the lesson, like an affective human instructor.''My own opinion is that if we had those ''Facial Action Cody System'' would help alot,so the teachers know when we are not interested in a assignment that they end up giving us.''Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.''Not even does this idea help you produce feelings like (happy,sad,and disgusted) them in a drama class, but even tells the teachers what you feel also. ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking by the look on your face.'' i wish we had this idea at my school but we dont.''of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial that conveys happy,worried,etc..'' I know how i feel when im sad because it is not a good feeling . We know how we feel we just have trouble saying it to teachers or others. With this idea we can actually say how we feel without even saying anything.       ","Dear principal, My friends do not like community service they think it is a waste of time and energy. I say that they shouldn't have to do community service if they don't want to. community service is about giving and doing in your free time not in time given to you or being forced to. then they do the job with a frown and a groan for example say my friend OTHER_NAME is helping the elderly with OTHER_NAME. OTHER_NAME likes doing this so he helps during school after school and during the community service class he happily does it with a smile on his face. OTHER_NAME will only do this if he has to and, during this job he will moan groan talk back and slack off. If you warn him to be good and not make noise he will think stuff in his head. So Mister I ask you not to make this mandatory not just for me and my friends but for the school let this be extracurricular for character education or something along those lines. ,Sincerely STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
719,901,"There can be many advanteges and disadvanteges to having a car but the advanteges to not having a card greatly outweighs having one. There can be many reasons why not having a car is great but the main three are it reduces pollution, reduces stress, and having less cars reduces the noice pollution in a city. Can you imagine a place with no cars? First off the main advantage of limiting car use is less pollution. Cars account for 12% of gas emissions in Europe and 50% in America. Without cars the air would be much cleaner and the Smog would be gone over the cities. London had so much smog over the city that they had to cut car use in half with all of their cititzens. After only five days most of the smog was gone and people could go back to driving. Imagine if we had everycar in the world stopped driving we could get rid of most of the smog in less than one week. Another great point on how limiting car use can help is it will reduce the stress gratly in peoples lives. In the first source a man from Vauban Germany said, ""When I had a Car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also another man from Columbia said during a day without cars, ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Most stress comes from roadrage or getting stuck in a major traffic jam. Imagine how stresless people will be without cars Finnaly reducing car use will graetly reduce the noice pollution everywhere. When you go out side whats the first thing you hear? People? Childrean? NO, all you can hear is the engine of cars everywhere. In a city where they banned most cars the sound of childrean drown out the occasional car engine not the other way around. Can you imagine how peacefull that would be not waking up to the sound of cars? In conclusion having a car can have its advanteges but limiting there use would be far better for people. It would help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and reduce noice pollution in cities and suburbs. Is having a car really worth it?    ","Is driving cars manually a thing in the past? Some people think and hope so. The new topic of having driverless cars might be the next big thing. There are some people out there that think that having these cars might be unsafe for people and the result is that it is illegal to test and drive computer driven cars in some states. I do believe that having these types of car will be great for our future. I think that having cars that are driverless would be a great thing. People saying that these cars are very unsafe and banning them from different states is nonsense. In the passage it says, ""In fact, none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills..."". This tells the reader that they are still manualed by the driver, the car just can do some of the ""easy"" things but can't do tough things like: driving through work zones and around accidents. There are some concerns about the car that would most definatly needed worked and studied on to make sure the car is safer and better for the people. A major problem that this car would have would be getting into accidents. In the passage it talks about the accidents and says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"". This is a very big problem because right now, no one knows who's fault it would be. If the ""driver"" was sitting back and letting the car drive its self and its crashes into another car or an object, who's fault is it? This is a major concern for a lot of people and the people making these cars; however can be solved by lots of studying and testing for the cars. This is why that having these cars that are driverless would be a great idea. In conclusion, having driverless cars might seem crazy to some people and seem like there is no way it would happen. Lots of studing and testing have gone into this idea because some people want a dream to become a reality. These driverless cars are big concerns but in the long run might be safer to people then just normal cars. Having driverless cars would be very good for us to have in the future.

Do you like to help people in need then you should join the seagoing cowboys. Lots of people need help ,they need food supplies ,animals and many other things. You will also be having lots of fun and you will be able to enjoy yourself. There are lots of other place to see and different foods. If you join now you will see different cities,countries and foods. There are lots of diffent types of food to try and maybe you might really like one type of food. Cities are diiferent from other ones they may be alike but not really. There are different types of cities to see . Countrys are way different nthan other ones and some other ones speak a different langue. Don't you think it would be great if you to lean a different langue? When you would come back to your home you would be ale to teach others different cultires and lanuges. Helping others is a great thing to do and very inportant. There are lots of people without food or cloths to wear. People need help because their towns have been destroyed and they have nothing left for them. They also need animals to perduse meat, wool, and they can sell htem so they can get money to buy things. Lots of those people are dieing from hunger or they are out side with no place to sleep or even sit. They need our help,they need your help. You might be think how am I going to get there. We will take you by boat but you might be wondering that seems boring and we will have nothing to do on the boat. There is lots of things to do on the boat. You can feed the animals as we take to different places. Does that seem boring to you if so you are right but there are othering things to do such as baseball and volleyball games and other games. On the back that is when you can really start having fun. SInce there are no animals on the boat that extra space can be use as a table-tennis room and you can have tournamets. You can also have fencing,boxing,reading, whittling. Do you still think you will not like being Seagoing CowBoys? There are many different food,cities,and countires. Helping the people in the need who dont't have food suplies and animals. Also all those fun games you would be able to play and how you would be able to make new friends and talk to different people. That seems like a great program i would join and i have joined the Seagoing CowBoys. To see different things,to help lots of people ,and to meet different people and have a good time with them. I don't know about you but I sure would want to be a part of the Seagoing Cowboys. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys program you would have a great time.         ","Distractive driving Two seconds is all it takes to risk the lives of the driver and people on the road. For the driver to take their eyes and brain off the task of driving is highly dangerous. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they are putting their safety and others endangered and risk rising insurance prices. Multitasking and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is distracting to the driver, which can be life-threatening. Distractive driving effects all drivers equally whether the driver is talking on the phone, texting, on social media, or taking photos. For example, Emily wrote, ""Unfortunately, more and more people are making the dangerous decision to text and drive, which causes 1.6 million crashes and almost 400,000 injuries per year, according to The National Safety Council-that's one out of every four car accidents!""(Delbridge) In other words, studies found that operating a mobile phone while driving slows the reaction time of the driver, and restricts a driver's perception skills; which increases the likelihoods of being involved in a collision. Distractive driving is equivalent to drunk driving because the behavior causes negative consequences that are life threatening. Especially for inexperience drivers and those who lack skill. To add on, the ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"" states, ""In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States."" (Distracted Driving Research) All driver should know that if they cause an accident because of risky behavior, their car insurance rate will certainly increase. It is important to know because the bad behavior of distractive driving can have an impact on other drivers too. For instance, Emily's article states, ""Because of this, car accident rates have risen over 14 percent since 2014. Not only does this make driving more dangerous for everyone, but it also contributes to increased car insurance premiums for everyone."" (Delbridge) The car insurance premiums are established by many different components, including the drivers' neighborhood, age, distance of commute, driving history, and the behavior of other drivers. The last category is why texting and driving effects everyone. Those who tend to use their cellphone while driving is the reason that the annual U.S. traffic fatalities are rise with insurance claims. Drivers should not use their mobile phone in any way while operating any motorize vehicle. If there is any need to use the cellphone for emergencies, the GPS, or music, Please, pullover or do it before you start to proceed driving. In conclusion drivers need to drive and only drive because whatever it is that is distracting is not worth people's lives. Work Cited Delbridge, Emily.

Wallington 3            ","I agree with the principal on this decision. Extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. Colleges and jobs like people who are determined to learn and try new things. These activities allow us to get a full grasp on life and truly live through it. We can use these activities to meet new people and make new friends. Extracurricular activities shape peoples lives, which is why I will be explaining why everybody should try at least one activity. Firstly, extracurricular activities allow us to learn new things which we can use later on in our lives. These activities spark new hobbies and interests which shed some joy on life. Their are a variety of activities around the world which lead to a vast amount of things people can learn including, a language, a new sport, or a musical instrument. These activities allow us to do things other than sitting at home watching television. We need to put a good change in our lives otherwise their is no point in living it. Secondly, colleges and jobs like people who are determined to learn and try new things. Extracurricular activities show we can handle multiple things at once, which allows employers to know you can handle the work they give you. Also, after learning something from an extracurricular activity you can use it to help your associates at work which could lead you to getting promoted. Colleges like people who enjoy trying new things, it shows you are willing to do the things the college has to offer, which looks good for the school. Colleges also like people who use the knowledge that the school gives to them instead of wasting it on nothing at home. Lastly, we can use these activities to meet new people and make new friends. If you do go to extracurricular activities their is a good chance you will meet new people who like the same activity that you do and it's someone that you can talk to. Humans need companionship, and an easy way to find friends is through extracurricular activities which give us someone to laugh and have a conversation with. We don't want to be lonely all our lives, and an easy way to get around that is to make friends, friends help us when we fall ,and cheer us on when we get up, we help them and they help us and everybody feels great when doing so. We need to realize all the good extracurricular activities have to offer by now. They help us learn new things, meet new people, and get a better college education and a job. These activities shape our lives and give us something to enjoy and look forward to daily. We need to appreciate all the opportunities we have to learn new things that other people don't. We can't waste this precious life away by doing nothing fun or exciting, to fully get a grasp on life we need to reach out and grab it. Our principal isn't torturing us by making us do an activity, he's trying to help us in this short but amazing life of ours.","Facial Action Coding System I think is a good idea because if someone is trying to figure out how you are feeling and you don't tell them they can look on the computer and tell what your emotions are. In the passage it tells that the computer is 3-D and has 44 major muscle. This tell us that if a friend is feeling a way you can tell and you would actually know itts true and not false. In paragraph one it explains to me that there are six basic emotions and they are happiness, surprise , anger ,and ect. For example your frontalis muscle above your eye raises your eyebrows when you are surprise. Some people wouldnt think that this is possible but I think its something good. When a student is looking at the computer they can pick up all emotions like if you have mixed emotions or just one. Someimes teachers want to know how they students are feeling but just don't want to walk up to the and just ask. This computer I think was a wonderful thing that someone can make. If I ever had this computer it would be very useful to me because want to know how others feel. Some people who try to just look at someone and tell how they are feelings is not always helpful they might think its one thing but its another. Most people are not just good by going off someone's look but this computer can help out alot you don't need to try and guess what that person is feeling. Evan when some artist are trying to draw a ppersons emotion they don't always know either they would also need the computer . Dr. Huang says in te story that Da Vinci has and comuter when he draw so that he could get the specific factial expression. If I was to get one of these computes i would like to use it on everyone around me because I love to see people happy and if they are not I would like to make there day. If I am taking a test and I get confused I know that the computers see that and the teacher would know and try to help me out a little. Using these can help everyone out in so many differen ways. Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one. If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is. This would be good when a school have a play and the people that are watching them need or want to figure out how the characters feel.   ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, There has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home. My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink. My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work. My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program. In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, student of SCHOOL_NAME.",,,,,,,
719,923,"Limiting car use can help us live better lives. The terrible smog that harms the environment called pollution is caused by the excessive use of vehicles in communities. I believe limiting car use can help us reduce pollution, more accessibility to public transportation, and helps you save money. Reducing the use of vehicles can help the environment. Join in and make the world a better place, literally. With less cars being used in communities the risk of pollution can be decreased. When you don't use your car you help the environment. People use cars to go to places they can easily walk to, but they don't. Some people don't even care about the environment or if they harm it. By reducing the car use in many communities pollution can be greatly reduced. Public transportation is cheap and quick. Using more public transportation helps you save money and helps the environment. Pollution can be reduced by just taking the bus instead of your own car. According to ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky more people tend to get the initiative to take public transportation. You don't have to do something extraordinary to help the environment, maybe all you need to do is take the bus. People tend to buy less cars if you limit car usage. The less cars you buy means the more money you save. According to ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal a study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. The people who drove less between that time must have saved alot of money on gasoline. When you don't use your car as much it ends up benefiting everybody. By limiting the useage of cars the environment benefits a great deal. Pollution can be reduced to a point where it causes minimal harm if everybody decides to pitch in. Transportation will recieve more funding. You will be able to save plenty of money on gas and use it for whatever other purpose you may need it. In conclusion, car useage should be reduced so that everyone may benefit from it.    ","The driverless car seems like an interesting invention that could possibly keep drivers safe and form good habits, but what if it just makes the problem worse? The driverless car is new to us and it might give us a hand on the road. There is also the possibility that the cars malfunction or don't respond to commands. These cars are part of the age of technology and we all know that it's not always helpful. Smart cars take a long time to assemble and adjust to. With all of the sensors, motion sensors, and a GPS, there hass to be something on the car that hasn't been looked over. The GPS has to update to be aware of it's own surroundings. That may seem like a handy feature but GPS's aren't always right and this could lead to trouble. The sensors in the car are able to detect danger on the roads but they can only detect a certain distance away. In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels to detect out-of-control skids and rollovers. They have advanced to be able to signal the brakes when this happens. These operations stilll need improvements though. The big problem nowadays is texting and driving. The roads are a lot more dangerous with people constantly getting distracted on the road and this has caused many injuries and deaths. Now how would a car that can operate itself, help to get rid of these habits? The answer is, they don't! Allowing drivers to take it easy on the roads and be lazy isn't going to help anything. Adding alarms to the car can lower accindent rates but people shouldn't need to be alarmed of danger. Driver's should be watching the roads like a hawk does it's prey. Adding safety features can only do so much to keep someone safe. What is needed most is a feature that can break these habits of bad drivers. ""Some manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" That's actually a good thing to make sure people behave right when driving. If the driver forms better habits, then we wont have a thing to worry about. Sensors to detect pedestrians and other cars coming provide better transportation and lower accident rates. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe."" With these new advancements to personal transport, we are making the world a little safer. That doesn't mean that we saved the world from the apocalypse or anything.","In World War 2, I was asked if I wanted to join thew UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. I believe that you and others should join because you maybe be helping your country and other countries. Also if you join it will help you in the long run by getting you special offers from other army groups and countries. If you could join would you, why or why not? I really think you should join because it is a really fun experince. I have multiple reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys of the UNRRA. One reason you should join is that you could sightseeing while you are picking up the animals from the country ar in or on the way to other countries. Another reason you should join this program is when you turn 18 you could join other military services and other projects like this one. The thrid reason is the you get work with animals such as young cows, mules ,and horses. Final reason is that when you ngo from country to counrty you will go relaxz and have fun with your mates and you could final read that book you been wanting to read. Those are my reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. After all of these reasons would you want join the program. I am telling you it will do you some good later on in your life and you will love going aroundthe wolrd and explore. Oh and did I forget to teel you that you have you do an hourly check on the animals and you get to feed them. After all The trips you will be very grateful for the experince and opportunity to go acroos the world. Lastly You can do so much fun stuff on board after you are return from trips by doing stuff like fencing, boxing, table-ennis matches. and ithers games and activies. JOIN THE SEAGOING COWBOYS PROGRAM!!!  ","Phones & Driving Nowadays, most people have a cell phone and use them in everyday life. People own cars as well. Imagine mixing the two, phones and cars, using the mobile devices while driving. That doesn't seem so smart but most people do it anyways and it's very dangerous. ""Why is it dangerous?"" you may be thinking. Maybe you're just changing the song playing because it's an annoying one that just started and you don't liked it, maybe someone texted you, maybe your mom is calling you. As simple as changing the song, texting back, or talking to someone on the phone sounds, it's very dangerous. Doing so is known for causing most car accidents today, if the impact is bad then it could lead to death. Using a mobile device while operating a vehicle is illegal and you'll get pulled over for it if you get caught by a cop. As bad as it already is, yes, hundreds and thousands of people still do it every single day. Maybe the person doing so didn't get pulled over or didn't get in a car accident, but one never knows when that is going to happen. That day can happen sometime today, or tomorrow, or sometime next week. Whether one is bored in traffic, it's still not a good idea to be using the phone. As for having a hands-free Bluetooth device, that's the only possible outcome for one using a cellular device while operating a vehicle. A Bluetooth is a source of operating a connection between anything, in a vehicle, most people use the connection for their phones so they can drive without touching their phone so they don't have to let go of the steering wheel. Having a Bluetooth is a very helpful and beneficial device to have inside a vehicle. People tend to think you should be able to use your phone while driving, not for texting or phone calls, but for directions or a GPS. If one is using their phone for directions to a place then that should be okay. They don't have to be holding their phone as well which is even better. The person with their GPS on, can purchase a phone stand or phone holder that they can install inside of their vehicle. The benefit of having this is that it's both safe, and affordable. With the stand/holder being safe, no phone has to be held with one hand and the other on the steering wheel. One will just have to glance at it for a second or two so they're aware of where they're going. As well as being affordable, it won't hurt purchasing one from your nearest store, it's found inside many stores and pharmacies. Some cars nowadays come with a Bluetooth installed already in the car, so if one's car has it or not, there should be a consideration in purchasing one. In conclusion, using your phone while driving is very dangerous, but that's why there are Bluetooth and hands-free calls now which makes everything better and safer. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, unless they have a Bluetooth device, which either way, they have to be safe and careful for their safety.         ","Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? I disagree with making kids do extracurricular activity For example, time is something that passes all the time. Not all of the students can get a ride, adding this will cause the student to become more stressed. In all, adding extracurricular actives is a bad idea. Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle. Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air. buses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride. Sols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. Making kids do something that that they don't have time to do creates a lot of stress. Students should be able to chose what they want to do. If they can handle doing extracurricular activates then they can, it shouldn't be a must. Making kids do something that isn't needed will drag them down making them now want to come to school. School should be a place of safety were kids can chose what they need to succeed in life. Making kids do extra activities will make students have less time for home, not all kids can get a ride home from school, doing this will ad more stress. Do you have enough time?             ",I think teaching how to do this to students is a very good idea. Because if we teach this to students we can tell if a person is having a dad day and you can help them out or not. You could also tell if someone is happy or sad. You could tell if they are havin g a dad day and you could try and make them have a good day. You could tell if someone was having suicidle thoughts or is just joking. If you see someone that is happy you could try and keep them happy all day. The author also tells you could not do this with your home PC because it coundn't handle the complex algorithms that you would need for this to work. He tells you what muscles to look for that are bieng used if you try this on a lab partner. He tells you what muscles that are needed for a genuine smile and what muscles to look for on a forced smile. Like in a real smile the person would be using Zygomatic major(muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. But in a false smile the person would be using the muscles called the Zygomatic muscle and the risorius muscle also.,"To The Editor: Many people think that cleaning trash is very helpful and many people think it wastes time. I believe that the students should choose whether or not if they would like to clean trash or spend their time doing what they want to do. Some students might not clean litter but those students may be doing something else for the community. Furthermore, it should not take many people to clean much trash. Students may also be cleaning trash on their own time as well. People who tutor the elementary school kids, that is very nice, but some students also think it wastes time. Let those students choose to tutor or not. Some students may have important activities to do and cannot afford to waste that time. For example, some students have a sport team to go play with or practice. Others may have after school classes to attend to. Many students can help trash but there are many who cannot afford to do those stuff. The principal should not make all students require to help perform community service. Students who do other community service might have a lot of free time, but there are those who have little time to spend. There are those who might have a part time job, or helping a friend, or they have to do a lot of homework as well. These students have a lot to do so they cannot spend their time on community service.",,,,,,,
271,220,"I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accidents and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving.   ","""The Face on Mars"" Could not be an alien creation becuase, it most likely would be more high tech because ""Aliens"" are lightyears ahead of our technology. Also NASA said it was just a huge rock formation that was formed by shadows to create ""The Face on Mars."" Also Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a really good picture which first appeared on a JPL website that was confirmed that the face was not an Alien monument. Also if aliens were to create this ""Face"" why didnt people in space see them do it. The Mars Global Surveyor's took at picture at maxium pixel to show that this ""momument"" was accually a little bigger then a buttle or a mesa. ""The Face on Mars"" is not an alien monument reason being they confirmed ot was in fact a rock formation that had shadows make it look like a face.","Dear TEACHER_NAME, 2/15/11 I heard that you were considering two different policies about cell phones on campus. Many students are going to be happy that you are considering to change the current rule about cell phones, but I think that the second policy is the way to go. No cell phones of campus is the best for many reasons. First, they are extremely distracting because if we are aloud to have them, that is all we will be worrying about. I know, personally, that my cell phone can make me a different person. Texting can be addicting, as most teenagers will tell you, but if you allow us to have phones on campus, we are likely to be on it all the time. Some will say, ""I can get away with it"" or ""the teacher won't even know."" Nine times out of ten, if we have them at one point of the day, they are likely to stay with us and not be put away when they are supposed to be. Second, many teenagers can be bullied over the phone. One kid will act like he is someone to else to trick another, and that will turn out to be bad because that person was not who they said they were. Another reason is that if there are two people who don't like each other, and one of them gets a-hold of the other's number, they can say extremely mean things. Finally, cell phones are to much of a distraction for us to be aloud to have them on campus. I hope that you take my opinion into consideration and help it influence your decision. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME         ","When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad and her friends. They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue! I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts on what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on. Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. ","well i think we should all help the community. so i say yes to assign community service because i going to tell you my three main ideas why we should .first reason is because we should all help out the community second is because it will show we care about are community and finally we should feel good we help everybody around us. my first reason is we should all help out the community because we don't want be living in a community that is dry and there's tagging all over the wall it doesn't look right .how are people want move in if we got are community looking like a trash can. or you rather be living in a nice community where there's parks around us and the grass is green and all are houses are nice taking care of. well i rather live in a nice community. when young people start to make a different about there community it make the community much better. even if one person gets a bag and goes around start cleaning the community each the community looks nice clean and care for. it only takes one person to do that and after that a hole group of people could paint old house and community will just feel better look better even smell better. finally when you ever helps someone else from your heart don't my feel better about yourself. well you should because helping a community its like helping your self and everybody around you too. who wouldn't like helping other because you should feel happy .its a get feeling when you help some they really persisted your do in that. as you can see those are my three main ideas why you should give every body community service because we should help the community out ,to show we care about are community and last because it feel nice to do something for others why we should have community service.","The story about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describe how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enable computers to indentify humans emotion by writing a essay arguing weather the use of this technology or to read the emotional expression ? Will I think by using this technology if it bring a smile to my face while it shows how much this computer can do. Then I might have to get it. Like if the computer no if im happy or sad in my emotion then thats a be a good feeling I dont know why but it will. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. So if you confused on something the computer could help or figure it out for you . I think its good because if the teacher is helping another students work the computer could help the kids or whoever. So I think it will be good for students to get a smart computer like that so when you do need help like that or feeling disgusted or fearful the computer will help. Like on her last asignment she could feel not knowing how to do things .Then you can calculate emotions like the math homework . In the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face in if you dont know how to work a app it will show you . But one reason why I dont know about it because one day you can be mad in not let no one know . Or want somebody to know whats going on with you. So I think thats probably one reason . Then you might not want help or want people seeing your emotion even the teacher. so thats the reason I probably would'nt get on the computer for that reason or some people probably just dont like the setting to it or probably want think its useful.. But last I think its valuable in someways in school or at home . Sometimes people dont know whats wrong with they body. They can get right on the computer in so the computer could tell them like your despress or things like thats . So I think its a good learning envoirment for the kids in grown ups . So thats some reason why I thi nk its valuable. ","School is a stressful place for teens nowadays. Having to look good, having the best hair, keeping up with friends, or just trying not to start trouble. With these things always plaguing the back of their minds students can hardly stay on task or get to work. But with modern technology there are now more options; using the internet online learning is possible just from staying at your own home. Doing this will reduce students being stressed out from being at school and help keep them focused. Having the option to take classes from home using online or video conferencing will be beneficial for students. Teens always stress over the littlest of things, so if they were at a place where they are most comfortable it would help them stay calm. Most distractions in the classrooms come from students worrying about themselves wondering what the other students think about them. This takes away from their focus and keeps them occupied in their mind about something completely irrelevant and not about the class. Allowing them to stay at home and take classes from there, they don't need to worry about that since their is nobody to judge them. Online classes have more usage than just getting rid of classroom distractions. It also provides a way for students to still be learning with issues in getting to school. Missing class is damaging to students learning and because unforeseen events can happen at random times, these problems are unavoidable. It could be weather, sickness, a problem within the school, or there being traffic delaying school buses and parents dropping off kids. With the usage of online classes however, it would help keep students learning even if their is a problem outside of their control. Now, some people may say that because students are at home they can still get distracted from other things around them. This is a good point however, the benefits still out weigh the negatives. Students will always be distracted by something but being at home all they need to focus on is their work and not their peers around them. Mainly phones are a huge problem but with the help of parents or guardians they can keep their child away from distractions when it's time to work. Now that they are away from all of those problems they can completely stay on task with their work and complete it proficiently Regular school should still be an option but allowing students to have the choice to choose online classes will help those who believe it would help them more. Even students who believed that simply going to school would help them more could still find benefits from using online classes. With the use of modern technology and the help of schools, online classes could just be the future of learning.",,,,,,,
271,563,"Cell phones were first presented in the US in the time of 1980 and their utilization right away developed during the following two decades. One of the essential explanations behind the enormous development of phones is that they encourage correspondence offering an increasing amount of adaptability contacting wanted individuals inside seconds. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. Different drivers out and about consider drivers on their mobile phones whether they need to or not in light of the dangers they make. Mobile phones allow users to reach others during crisis notwithstanding during driving, in spite of a viable method for correspondence, utilizing cell phones during driving outcomes in diverting consideration of driver increasing road safety concerns. To begin with, we have turned out to be so centered around the amount we can do at one time that we are eager to chance our own security just as the wellbeing of others since we can't put down our cell phones. Studies found that a cell phone put drivers at a four times more serious danger of an accident. When driving, once in a while it is hard to concentrate out and about which makes it simple to overlook that the streets are shared by everybody and not for your use. A young lady slaughtered a walker on a bike while she was messaging on her telephone. She might not have proposed to take such an individual's life, however she settled on the poor choice to drive and text which she needs to live with for the rest of her life. Any of us could have been that poor individual on that portentous day. Regardless of the dangers, individuals still use cell phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says ""He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of "" ... the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. On the other hand, those whose work relies upon a mobile phone like legal advisors or agents state that they generally must be accessible to pick up the telephone to keep their business running. Be that as it may, due to their propensities, they can make risky and unsafe circumstances like an impact or a mishap. Business issues can be upsetting and perilous while driving since it can cause enthusiastic responses that can prompt disaster. As a result of the discussion they may get furious and this can bring down their driving capacity that can prompt lose power over the vehicle. If Individuals don't settle on a choice to secure their mobile phones their routine can hurt honest individuals. Rivals state that without hands set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. Nonetheless, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing a mishap and even may it intensify by recommending that the conduct is sheltered. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing headset can be as risky as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture individual who they conversing with and that doesn't meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves startlingly or person on foot venture into traffic, and the mind comes up short on the handling capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn't in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap in view of need man oeuvre, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the especially time. In conclusion , if individuals don't surrender their cell phones, the quantity of fatalities on the streets will even now increment. It is individuals duty to not bring about their very own and others individuals lives. these days mobile phones are pointless gadgets since they are untrustworthy in crisis circumstances while On Star is dependably plan to help you in a mishap. Reckless driving is something that we as a whole get very worked up about, particularly on the off chance that it makes us late or is generally an immediate burden to us.      ","Brock was walking in the woods along the creek. At the edge of the water, he saw something that made a body type figure. Brock went down to see if it was a body, but when he got down there, it was really hard to see if it was a body because of the running water. He went back up to where he saw the body, and he coud see it clearly again. He took a picture of the body figure and sent it to the Elkart County Lab. They went to take a look at it and they posted the picture sent from Brock online. Most of the people who saw it, including some of the scientist, thought it was some sort of alien figure. They dug it out and found it to be a rock formed into a body shape by the shadows of the water, and the erosion that has been done to the rock. I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it isn't an alien formation, you can see what it is made of, and there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real. One example that proves my claim is that the author explains in the excerpt that it isn't an alien formation. The author states that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed that it was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The author also states that it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Another example that demonstrates my claim is that according to the author, you can see what it is made of. The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" A final example that proves my claim is that the author demonstrates that there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real. The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze. Now I hoped I gave you enough information to convince you that the Face is just a natural landform, and not created by aliens.   ","Dear principal, Many people in our school probably think that cell phones use should always be aloud. For me it's different , I think that cell phone use should only be aloud when students have a free period or a lunch period. This should be aloud because students may need to use there's cell phones for important things like , if there is a intruder in the school students might want to call there parents and let them know. Students should not be able to use cell phones during school because they can be distracting & disturbing. Cell phones are very addictive. Students may use there cell phones all day when they are at home. School is a place for learning not using your cell phones. Teachers get very annoyed when students phones go off. During school hours I think cell phones use should be limited at the time you can use them . For example, lets say we are sitting in English class & a students phone goes off. To you , the students who are also trying to do there work and the teacher it can get very annoying & very disruptive. Students should be aloud to use there cell phones during free & lunch periods because they aren't disrupting anyone when there cell phone goes off. Many students text their parents during school & other kids in their lunch period. Students may need to text their parents during class but they just have to wait until they get a free period . In conclusion, in my mind students should be able to use their cell phones during free periods or lunch. Other students may think they should be able to use there cell phones during all school hours. Why do other people think that ? People can get hurt by the people who are texting in the halls & not paying attention. That is why i think students should not b e able to use cell phones during class time","How many people do you go to when you need advice? People usually go to more than one person like their mom, dad, sibling, aunt, grandparents, friends etc. People ask other people for advice because they think that a different perspective might help them make a better choice. Sometimes it does work. Seeking multiple opinions is helpful because, sometimes people have more experience, you'll get different opinions and next time you'll know who to go for advice. People always ask to someone who has more experience. This is usually someone who's older than you, been through the same stage or knows you closely. For example, maybe you go to your mom for advice. Your mom is older than you, she might have been confused like you and nobody knows you more than your mom. Whenever a person goes to ask for advice their is always person he/she goes to that's an elderly. Another reason, is that you'll get different opinions. So then your brain will work differently, you'll have multiple choices and your decision won't be biased. Like, maybe you want to go to a specific college, but your still not sure. So you ask for some advice. After you listen to different people's opinions, your brain will work differently. Then you'll realize that their are many other choices and then when you finally decide to go, then you won't blame yourself for being biased. So it's good to get different opinions because they will really help you. Finally, if you ask for advice once then you'll know who to go to next time. After you ask advice from one person than you'll go to them again because, you know them really well, you trust them now and you know that they will help you no matter what. For example. you ask you grandmother fr help again. You go to her because, you already know each other really well, you trust each other and you know that she will do anything to help you. So once you ask for advice, you'll know who to trust next time. In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people is helpful because, you'll get multiple choices, you'll know who to trust next time and some people will have more experiences to share. You'll get multiple choices because your brain will work differently, you'll get lot's pf options and your decision won't be biased. You'll know who to trust next time because, you already know them, you trust them really well and you know that they will help you no matter what. Some people will have more experiences because, they are older than you, they have been through the same stage and they know you really well. So next time don't hesitate to ask advice from more than one person.","Dear Principal I think we should help with community service, because it makes our town a better place. People could help by recycling, cleaning up our lake or picking up the trash on the sides of the roads and at the parks. people should recycle because it gets rid of all the plastic waste that could harm the animals in their ecosystem that they survive in, and it just makes the world a better place in general. cleaning up our lake is another good way to help our community factories should not put waste products in the fresh water that we use in our every day lives it can harm the animals and most importantly us, by getting rid of all the trash think of how much more prettier the lake would be no one wants to go see a trashy lake and then later get a drink of water and think wait this may of had tons of trash in it gross. Getting rid of trash in the parks and roads are also good for the town it makes us look like a town who cares about what they look like. there should be schedules saying who cleans where, when, and how long so its not just one person doing all the work and every on taking the credit , and that would eliminate arguments over who cleaned more. i would recommend community service for our school.","The use of the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because we can know how that person is feeling at the time. Would you like to know if a person is feeling sad,happy,bored, or even angry? Of course,not only do we know how they feel but we can also take a step futher on helping them. If a person is depressed we can talk to someone close from them and explain what they are going through, or advice them for that person to take therapy. The Facial Action Coding System is also a great start to poeple who are new to school or even to sports. If a person feels sad because they arent doing as good as their other teamates, The coach should use the software because it will let him/her know why that person isnt really trying in the sport. Another reason why im for it is because teachers really dont know when you are bored or confused. Especially if you are one of those shy prsons that dont like raising their hand. By using this software teachers can go up to you and explain you with what you are having trouble. If a student is bored with what the what teacher is teaching, she should probably try something new to get the students attention. This technology can also show us when someone has a fake smile for example if you think that you have a friend that really isnt your friend and you talk to her she might be giving you a fake smile because she probably doesnt like you. The use of this software can determine if you are having problems in your house,the expressions that will show would be sadness and probably anger. In todays world you may be going through a lot but people may not know and they would treat you like garbage. This would then cause you depression and probably then commiting suicide. Having this technology ""Facial Action Coding System"" in hands can help you stop somone from danger. having this technology can ressolve a lot of problems with putting yourself into it. Every perosn has a falling action and a resolution to their story. With just a facial expression it can change realtionships and friendships.""Making people smile"" is what we need with Facial Action Coding System!","Some schools offer online or distance learning as a way of still taking classes outside the classroom or at home. Because not every student has the same circumstances, the traditional classroom may not be the best fit for every student. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because not everyone learns in the same way, and it can be the right path for some people based on their circumstances. One way online learning benefits students is it allows them to attend classes around their own schedule. Some students may be exceptionally talented at a sport or musical instrument, and they can spend more time practicing while attending online classes that fit their schedule. If a student plans on pursuing a talent based career, then going to school seven hours per day will likely not prepare them for that specific career. For example, it is more important for a professional swimmer to spend time practicing swimming than time taking classes. This can also be applied to prospective professional swimmers. With distance learning, talented students would be able to continue practicing their talent while also continuing their education. Online school would be incredibly beneficial for those with who choose to take different paths while still pursuing their education. Students spend around thirteen years of the first few years of their lives in classrooms. While education is very important, sometimes the most effective way of learning isn't the traditional classroom. Cultural and language immersion in different countries is another way to learn. Immersion is without a doubt the quickest way to learn a language and about other cultures around the world. Worldly and cultural experiences are valuable ways to learn, and may be the right option for some people. While traveling the world, students can still keep up with their studies through distance learning. These experiences are very valuable and do not come from the traditional classroom. People with nontraditional familial circumstances can also benefit from distance learning. For example, if a student has a child, parent, grandparent, or sibling that they need to take care of, they can attend online classes while still caring for their family. Another example may be if a student needs to work to help support their family or child. If a family member gets sick and needs extra money or assistance, students can take online classes and work to support this family member. Education and family life are very important, and distance learning can assist students to balance each of these parts of their lives. Even if this is a temporary condition, online school can help people adapt to unexpected circumstances while remaining in school. Finally, distance learning can benefit students who have unique learning styles and can allow them to take classes at their own pace. Attending online classes can be more personalized in the way that students can go as fast or slow as they want. They could attend four online classes in a day, or take one and have the opportunity to make sure they understand all of the content. Some people may also be more comfortable alone while learning, and want to figure problems out on their own. The traditional classroom is not always right for everyone. Whether it be because of the choice to travel or hone a skill, the need to take care of a family member, or personal learning style, distance learning offers a more flexible approach for any student's circumstances. It is important to be sensitive and open to other people's priorities and conditions, and the option to attend online classes offers this flexibility in freedom, while allowing students to continue their education.",,,,,,,
271,901,"Phone should not be used while driving on the road because you're putting yourself, others drivers at serious risk and you can get in trouble. That's why the law says know texting while driving because it wouldn't be safe. Well really you get a ticket but I think they people should go to jail because that's something can't pay around with like people get in bad car accidents because of people wanted to be hard headed and not following rules. Rules are helpfully especially when it's serious that that people should follow. That all about being safe and doing the right thing. If you don't want to follow them. Then you will have to face the consequence and learn from them. People may make mistakes but when you're on the phone or texting and you get in a car accident, someone dies from it. That something you can't really take back. Then you would really want to go back and change things for the better. But you can't. Just imagine you lose someone because of that person was on their phone and not pay attention, you would want to know why just wait wouldn't till their done driving. You would of have been very much be upset. I think that drivers should text and call before getting in the car. Its better and it would make more since if they do that. They can also leave their phone at home. At long they don't drive while texting and call other people knowing that they can get a ticket. It's not good to put other people at risk while driving you can hurt yourself, that person, or people that's in the car with you. Being safe is important and following the rules is also important too. That's why people should take thing like this serious and tell their children to put on a seat belt and also don't text and drive eat the same time. You never know what might happened to you and you may face some consequence.   ","Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed ""Face on Mars"". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous. First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now. Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface? Additionally, even if NASA had found this further evidence, why would the company try to hide it? Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public. Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel. The photo just happened to be taken at the right time, at the right angle, by a pilgrim piece of technology. Further pictures, such as the ones taken in 2001, reveal that the ""face"" is just a mesa, with next to no details that resemble that of a human complextion. Think of it as the ""...Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" (paragraph 12) All in all, this ""face"" on Mars is no different from other conspiracies. Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the ""Bigfoot"" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence. The face on Mars is simply a clump of rock, nothing to be even slightly concerned about. Unless, of course, you are an individual who likes to be concerned about clumps of rock.","Dear Principal, I don't think cell phones should be allowed at school at any time. The reason i think this is because; it would be unfair to others, some people would take advantage of it, you should be studying or finishing work during your free time, having phones out at school could cause many problems, people would use phones to cheat on test or class work, and grades would start slipping in with many people because their phones would distract them from doing their work. Some ways it would be unfair to others is; those who don't have a phone wouldn't have the same advantages as others, while others are at free time or lunch the people in class wont get to have their phones, and those that don't have free time won't get to use their phones. Also, some kids would always have their phones with them and they would be texting instead of paying attention to the lessons. By doing that they wouldn't learn a thing. Therefore they are taking advantage of he privilege given to them. Free hour or free time should be used to study or make up on late or unfinished assignments. Free periods or free time is given to you for certain reasons, it is school time still, and you should use that time for school work not for social time. Having cell phones period causes problems imagine what it could do at school. Rumors and gossip will be spread around way more and a lot faster then without phones. Cyber bullying and fights will happen more. Phones may possibly be stolen or lost and that would not be good. Some people who aren't in class and have access to their phones might help someone cheat on a test or just the class work they have, and in that case grades from many people would slip because they aren't actually learning. Without students actually learning the school might start to look bad. I hope you agree with all or some of these conditions. I honestly believe cell phones and schools were not meant to be together. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Many people ask for advice in their lifetime. When it comes to asking for advice it could lead you to success or even failure. When people ask for advice they could get the right or even the wrong answer. Advice is not just a simple thing most people ask because they are clueless on what to do. It is a good idea to ask multiple people for advice in ways like it gives you more than one way on how to do something, someone might have a better opinion, and one person could have better experience on the topic you are talking about. One of the reasons that seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by having more than one right way on how to do something. By having more options open it can help someone handle the decision better from just having one idea. In order to having many ideas you would need to ask people around you for their opinion. With having more than one way on how to do something it can be good in anything you do. Most people like having multiple ideas on a topic because it helps them figure it out better. When people give you more than one way you dont always have to take the more reasonable advice, take the one that you think will help you at the end of the day. In the end having more options to choose from can lead you to success and to making the right decision. Although, having more options to choose from is better, someone might have a better opinion to give to you. With someone having a better opinion they could affect the decision in more ways than one. For instance, if your best friend has one idea but another peer has a better approach you would go with the idea that works the best. Sometimes in life the people you that think will have the best advice might not have advice for you at all, so you would have to make the choice yourself or find somebody that you normally wouldnt ask for advice. After all having better opinions on things can help you out more ways than you could imagine. Another way how asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better decision is that someone might have past experience with the situation. Asking someone that has experience with it can help you make a better and quicker choice than from someone who does not have the experience. People with experience often help those in need of their advice. For example if you ask your parents for advice and they dont know what to tell you, you could ask other family members that would know exactly what to say. Giving advice is sometimes like cheating on a test, it could help you out deeply or it could turn around and hurt you. Always ask someone who has experience with the situation rather than from someone who does not because it could help you out in the long run. In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is a good thing to do. Trying new ways to ask for advice can most likely always help you find the advice you really need. As showed asking multiple people for advice is good because it gives you more than one way for something, someone might have a better opinion, and someone could have more experience. Good advice has helped people over the years in different ways and it continues to do so. Most of all asking someone for advice is a key to when you are trying to make a big decision.    ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I am writing this letter to inform you that I do believe in your decision in making all the students of SCHOOL_NAME to do community service. I think they should do it because community service it a great way to interact with younger children and the community. There are all sorts of things to do from spending time with the young and elderly to cleaning the city. Some students think that doing stuff like that is boring because their not getting paid. It doesn't matter who you are or what race you are it matter about everyone coming together as a family. When you here the words community service you automatically think that its for bad people , but it's not. I would describe community service as a chance to reach out to people. It's just not about cleaning up you can have fun raisers. You can also have community get-togethers to help support breast cancer or something like that. It really doesn't matter just show your community some love and I hope the students and teachers of SCHOOL_NAME understands that. Yours Truly, STUDENT_NAME:) *_*","In my opinion, I think that this technolgy in this story can read emotional expressions. It says in the story: ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the falce all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Dr. Hunang says that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". The technology from this story and the technology in our present time is way different then in this story in our real world the technolgy has changed in many different ways having phones that track where you are and what your location is. The Phones, computers, and tablets have really changed over the past few years. Although in this story you are talking about mona lisa and what there technology consits of. In our era now we have 3D and 4D printers that you can print projects and other things from. In the story it says it scans mona lisa's face and tells whether she is mad or angry and a whole bunch of emotions and other things that go on during the scan. But you can proably tell how your friend or a person is feeling by the look on him or her's face. Computers are really changing alot on what processor it has in it and a bunch of new features added to the computer each year. Meanwhile, in the story it says by moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but it also may even help produce emotions. In conclusion, I explained whether the use of this technolgy in this reading to explain the emotional expresssions of students in a classroom.      ","Imagine you are attending classes at home you wouldn' t take it seriously as you do at school. Kids who are home schooled don't usually focus as much as they would at school. Some kids parents or tutor would give them more advantages that aren't given at school. Such as more breaks, better food options for lunch,linear schedule, and starting and ending time being optional. If students are learning a specific lesson by a video conference they wouldnt benefit the lesson as well as being offline. Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would take advantage, start on their own time, and they wouldn't understand the lesson. Schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conferencing. I used to baby sit this little girl named Generic_Name she went to school for two years now shes in the third grade and her parents are homeschooling her. Sometimes Generic_Name goes out to eat for lunch and she wakes up later than normal elementary kids do. Learning a lesson through a video isn't very beneficial for some students because they probably need more help understanding. The teacher can explain the lesson in a different way if the student doesn't understand but if they keep watching the video it isn't going to help them. Although,some may believe schools should offer distance learning as an option for students because they need a numerous amount of breaks, they should be able to work on their own time, and it's the same as an online class. Distance learning is the same thing as taking online classes or taking a college class online. Distance learning shouldn't be an option this is important because it can affect the way kids learn and how they understand it. Students can be thinking of the lesson in a different format than how the lesson is expressed in the video conference. It was important in the past being it wasn't and option because they didn't have the technology resources that we have today. It helps in the future because instead of going to college you can take an online college class and you would already have experience from it. If you are attending classes from home then you switch your routine and go to school you are going to be more experienced with online conferencing and you are going to be wanting to do everything on your own.         ",,,,,,,
271,923,"Cell phones should not be allowed while driving due to the big problems it usually causes. Using a cellphone while driving should not be allowed because you need to be considerate of the passengers. Using your cell phone while driving should also be banned because you need to be considerate of other motorist. Most importantly, cell phones should not be used while driving because you are more than likely at risk of having a wreck. Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Having other passengers in your vehicle you should think of them while you are driving because now not only your life but another person's life is in your hands and all it takes is one mistake. If you were to get into a bad wreck and you live and the passenger dies you will live with the guilt. There were 2,823 motor vehicle accidents among people age 13 to 19 years old. When driving you should not use your cell phone, because you need to be considerate of the other motorist driving. Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. Texting or on the phone while driving can be annoying to other motorist while driving also when you are swerving into other lanes. When you start to move outside of it, you start to risk hitting something, or someone. Most drivers who use their phone while driving put themselves and other people who are driving at risk of being in deadly car crashes. In 2011, 1.3 million automobile accidents were caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving makes you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident. In 2015, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers on U.S. roads. The AAA Foundation found that distractions last at least 27 seconds even after ending distracted activities. Statistics show that reaching for your device while driving you are 1.4 times more likely to crash In conclusion, Your goal while driving is to be as safe as possible. Not going to say it's an easy goal, but it is essential to ensure the safety of yourself and others. To make reaching this goal easier, eliminate distractions and stay off the phone until you get to where you're going. People should help reduce the number of accidents and teens killed in these accidents. Be Aceable!   ","If I worked at NASA and someone I know told me he/she beleive it was created by aliens I would tell that person to look at the facts. It shows in the picture and article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars"",""hugh rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."" While other people still think today that the picture was formed by aliens I have this to say. ""Why in the world will an alien was its time making a human face when they have never even seen a human before unless one came on earth."" In my point of view I personal do not belivie in aliens but I do belive that that ''face'' in Mars was a hoax. Like I said before I know that that face is a mountain that was accidental formed to created a human mask face. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. "" That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."" The mask itself is nautural formed the shadows just happenedly popped showed up in those spots and here on Earth weird things happen but does not mean that an alien did it. The fact, the edivence is all showed in the article and picture that it was a rock/mountain that formed a mask face if a human. ","Dear Principal, Cell phones are a big part of a child's life. Cell phones can help you thru a lot. Cell phones can be helpful or hinder you during school. I am here to help you choose one of the following polices that you are considering. I am going to tell you the positive and negative effects of policy one and two. Policy One: Positive: Students need to have there phones with them at all times for emergency purposes. They need to be able to come in contact with their parent or guardian. During free periods they should be allowed to talk to peers because it is their free time and should be allowed to associate with each other in a manner that they like. Negative: Some students would try to abuse this power so it would be best to have some type of limitation to this policy. During class time if you are caught with your cell phone out I think the student should be given a warning. It would be ok for a teacher to take the phone away if a warning has already been administered to the student unless the phone was off. If the phone was out and it was sited out then i think it should not be taken but to just tell the student to put it away. Policy Two: Positive: T","It has been shown in scientific studies that people who seek for advice are smarter than your average human and here's why. In today's world people who don't take advice seem to make terrible choices and actions. That's why taking someones advice could help you stay out of trouble and give an affect on you that makes he or she a better person. People that are giving you advice is just like an opportunity because you have a choice, listen or not. The people that don't listen are the same people that make bad decisions. On the other hand the people that do listen, learn now that the decision they were about to make could of had long lasting affects on their life. Seeking opinions can help someone make a better choice. As an example if someone was a serious beer drinker they are putting their life long affect on their body, just like someone who had a opportunity, they are like the people who don't take the advice. The long term affect it could have on you and your mind could last very long, inmates at a prison often regret their life decision. They wish they had someone tell them no or don't do it. Someone who has taken your advice could be a better person and spread your advice to other people. He or she would remember what you said for the rest of there life. This affect can result how they raise there children, what job they take when they grow older, who they become friends with, and what choices they make in everyday life. Every single one of those affects can decide their outcome as a person and they come from one source of advice. In conclusion seeking help can help in everyday life by saving people or just helping them get through the day. I hope to see tomorrows world take more advice and stop doing bad choices. I hope I would be able to walk down the street and see that there is less bad decision making and more better choices. I hope these two reasons would stick to you as great advice has stuck with me.","STUDENT_NAME Dear Mr. Principal, Community service to me is something that everyone should be a part of. It's good to help people who need help or deserve help. Community service is good because you get an opportunity to help others in need. Some people just need someone to talk to, or they need a friend. You only get a couple of opportunities to actually do something for the community. When you get to do something for the community you can also have a chance to show God's love to a person who could use a little bit of God's love. Some people just don't know where to get God's love, but you can help them get a little taste of love when you do something nice for the community. I definitely don't think that community service is a waste of time. Community service is something that you can do for the Lord. Community service can usually only take a couple of hours from your day. Community service can also change some ones life. It's nice to do something for the community. Community service is not just a waste of time it is a way to show people that you care about them, and love them. It's also okay if it takes just a few hours away from your day, it's important to show people God's love for them. Serving the community is something that everyone should be a part of. Everyone should have a chance at some points in their life to show community service to people. If no one shows community service, then how will we show God's love to others? God put us on this earth to tell people about Him. Our job isn't just to sit around a t home and watch television. We're actually supposed to get of the couch, and go get God's word out to people who need it. Some people will never get a chance to experience God. We might just be about the only people ever to tell them about God. We can even get a chance to witness to them, and lead them to the Lord. Yes, Mr. Principal, I do think that everyone should be a part of Community Service, because it is a chance to actually change the community. We can change some ones life by just doing a small act of service. You definitely should make everyone do community service. We need to get God out into our communities. Everyone needs to be able to get a chance to go to heaven. We need to get out there, and help people!","""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a great way to see if someone is happy. It can possibly help others to see the person in front of them and what their emotions are or what that person is 'trying to hide' It's all about muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (the muscles that begin at the cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around the eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being thruthful. Making a fake smile can also help produce a real one. Practicing with putting a pencil across your mouth works the same muscles as when a person is smiling for real. This project does help in forms that can tell when someone is being sad, happy, disgusted, surprised, angry, fearful, and/or sad. ","Is learning online a gift? Students should attend to classes from home because that way the students would have more time to study or do homework, the students would get less distracted, and the students would learn better if they feel more comfortable. Students would have more time to study, or do homework because they could start school later on the day, or students could start early it depends on how the students feel. Students would feel better if they had a better rest, or knowing they could do school whatever time they feel good. The students would get less distracted if they learned from home because they are not around their friend or peers, who are usually a distraction. Of course the students will get bored of being alone while doing school but it's better for them to stay focused on what they are doing, and plus they have a better understanding on what they are doing if the students don't get distracted. The students would be more dedicated on the homework's, tests, or projects because they would understand a lot more if they are not distracted by their friends. The students would learn a lot more if they are comfortable for example people pay more attention when they are in their rooms on their beds or when at their house. Students would rather sit on a comfortable chair rather than a school chair because when your sitting on the same chair everyday your body starts to hurt, or you don't feel comfortable sitting in that position. Students should have the opportunity to attend school from home because its more beneficial for them, they have a better timing, they are more comfortable when working from home, and they would get less distracted from other students.",,,,,,,
404,109,"Dear Principal, I believe that students should not have to have a B average. I believe this because most students aren't as smart as others. But they try their best, and sometimes peoples best are only C averages. Which if you think about it, it isn't that bad at all. The students love sports and you shouldn't be able to take that away because of one grade. If you take away our sports because one C average that's like taking away our exercise. And everyone needs to exercise to stay healthy. So, that's like a threat to our health. Most kids have a C average so most students wouldn't be able to play the sport or sports they love so much, and as a principal I know you would want what's best for the students and you want to see them happy. It shouldn't matter their grade average, let the students be happy while we're young. Let us continue to exercise. Another reason it should be changed to a C average or better is because being on sports teams is another way to make friends. A lot of people are shy but if their around the same people sometimes they can make new friends, and be more social which is good especially because we are young and many students are shy. Making new friends sometimes can help boost kids confidence, which is very helpful to students because many of them are shy, not social, and don't like talking to other people they don't know or haven't ever talk to. Sports teams is always a good way to be active and make new friends and sports are just fun! Grade averages are for school, not for sports teams. Coaches aren't worried about the grades. Their worried about getting kids into shape and having a good time. Like say a kid a on a sports team is a really good player and the coach really needs him for the big game but the kid has a high C average. Then the kid can't play and chances are the team might lose that big game. Then everyone is going to be disappointed and that chance might not ever happen again. And that would be extremely sad because that kid might not being playing next year he might being going to a different school or something. And that could be the last chance you ever get to a big game like that. the school and the students in it would be very upset because they wouldn't be able to say that their school made it to the championships or something like that. So, please we're asking you to make it at a C average or not even get our grades involved. Thanks so much. Sincerely, The Students","Modern day technology can identify human emotions. One very strong claim and great example is the 3D computer model. It begins when the computer constructs the model of a human face or painting. Leonardo da Vinci, a famous artist, painted The Mona Lisa, but new technology computer software can recognize emotion, according to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The 3D computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body, but it must move like human muscles. The movent of one or more muscles during this process is called an ""action unit"". According to Dr. Huang, ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", even though some individuals often show varying degrees of expression. When using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can track facial movements in a real face in a student or painting. Weighing in different units, the software can identify mixed emotions because each experssion is compared against a neutral face. For instance, in person, you can probably tell how someone is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. Scientists and Professors today would go over types of human emotions through the 3D computer model. The home PC you own can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's or any humans smile. The Facial Action Coding System only enables lab computers or computers at a University to identify human emotions. This same technology is used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. In conlusion, modern day technology can identify human emotions through a 3D computer or The Facial Action Coding System. The value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is very valuable and can be used to express how someone feels. I'm 100% for the use of this technology becuase this is a one of a kind new age technology.","Dear Principal, I write you to make a request to not make community service a requirement because not everyone will be comfortable doing so. You should make it a choice to be able to do community service. You should also give whom ever does participate gets extra credit, as a reward for doing so. Community service may seem fun for some people, but for others it may be boring or a waist of time. One of the reasons for that maybe that they don't have time or that they have other things that need to be done, like babysitting or something of that sort. Now if you want to a lot of people to do community service without being forced, then do something that they would like to do other than picking up trash for an example. Pick something like taking them to the A.S.P.C.A and let them work with the animals that they like. Take them to the senior citizen home and let them entertainment or be an audience for them. If you really want people to come offer an award of some sort that you know everyone wants and needs. That is all we ask of you. sincerely, student","TEACHER_NAME Allowing students to use cell phones at school is alright as long as you don't use them in class. The reason why I say this is because when you are in class the teacher is teaching and if you start using it, it's disrespectful. Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do. Using phones in class is really disrespectful and you'll never learn anything in class. If you are in a middle of a class, your teacher is teaching and suddenly you have a phone call or text. you shouldn't pick it up. Ignore the phone and stay with what the teacher is teaching you about. Also, you shouldn't leave your phone on in class because then its easier to concentrate what teacher is telling you. If your phone is on then your phone will vibrate, ring, and bother you. Then the phone's noises will urge you to pick it up. The bell ring's and its time for lunch or break time. Now, finally you can use your phone. Nobody is going to bother you and no teacher will be teaching you. So, now you can do whatever you want. Look at the text your friend gave you or call him. Also, no teacher or principle will come up to you and take your phone away because it's your time to do whatever you want. If the school's were like this, then nobody was going to pick up there phone's in class and they were going to wait until free time.","I would say that driverless cars could be dangerous in many cases. There could be an accident if there was a driver just going across the road and the driverless car malfunctioned. The driverless car could crash straight into the driver no matter how people see it. The article stated that driverless cars can't see the road themselves but they can sense when something is coming near it. Even if a driverless car sensed something near it; if the car was going at any type of speed like 25 mph it would probably hit somebody that it might not have sensed. Anything bad could happen with these new generation of cars, sticking to how regular things are is better than taking a risk of someone getting hurt. The moral of my essay is to tell people that even if people say there is no harm done by making these cars, the truth is anything could happen and it could malfunction anytime. My answer would be no to having driverless cars even if they made it a bit safer that doesn't mean it wouldn't accidentally crash into someone. Driverless cars would work better as a gps not as a car that could move on it's own.  ","Dear state senator I'm against the Electoral College, and i wish it would change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational, and there are many reasons why it should be taken out. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president(Source 2), this is unfair to voters because the people are not the ones that really choose the president. Also, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they focus only on the tight races in the swing states(Source 2). Why should we put the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters? Another problem with the Electoral College is its method of selecting the president, which may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state(Source 3). Knowing their vote will have no effect, the voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular vote(Source 3). If we're not voting for the president, but for the electors who will choose the president, then why are we voting at all? I say that it is our right to be able to choose who our next leader is going to be. With all the evidence I have listed in this letter, I hope you, state senator, will change your mind about the Electoral College. We must do what's best for our country, and the Electoral College is not fair to us, the people of the United States.                                     ","Phones and driving This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road. Using your cellphone can actually be deadly. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective. Using your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays. When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect. Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society. Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them. Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe. When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second. Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car. Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens. That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours.

404,235,"Dear Principle, I think that your ideas are great because in school we must have policies. The policy you are considering is a great one because people do not come to school just to try out for the football team or to play other sports. They come here to learn and hopefully get a better life or maybe go to college and actually be someone. We must not let sports ruin the grade of every student in the school. We must take a stand where learning meets sports. Many people let their grades drop because they have to ""focus on their game"" well now they must focus on their homework and on their big tests! Many students are good in sports and that's final but they fail every single test they lay their eyes on. So I think its great that you want them to not only be great at sports but to also be great in school. In fact I think that you should make them be in honor roll to be able to play sports.","Today's world contains greater technology than ever before, and it continues to become more advanced. Just one example of this technology is emotion recognition technology in which a computer can identify one's emotions from only his face. For example, Thomas Huang used this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotions of Mona Lisa, a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Experts are beginning to realize that this technology, Facial Action Coding System, could result in great advancements in the classroom. But will it really have great benefits in the classroom? I believe that there could be some tremendous problems with this new technology; but if it is used properly, it could have far greater results. Although there are some dangers involved, the Facial Action Coding System has great potential value for the classroom. The Facial Action Coding System could become a valuable tool someday in classrooms around the globe. But before looking at the great value that this tool could potentially bring, we must look at the harm that it could cause. One-on-one individual contact is vital to a child's education. Whether at home or in a classroom, a student needs an individual present in order to best teach him the concepts necessary for learning. If the computer begins to replace the teacher, then this Facial Action Coding System is no longer a benefit to the student, but rather a harm. On the bright side, however, the Facial Action Coding System does bring large benefits. Most importantly, it engages the student. Doctor Huang, innovator of this Facial Action Coding System said that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" It would then recognize that it needed to better explain the topic or rather grab the learner's attention. This could greatly benefit the academic world. Students could be taught individually, at their own pace, and possibly even in their own way. Those more advanced could move on to more advanced subjects, while those struggling could receive the help they need. Facial Action Coding System, a wonder to us all, could greatly affect today's world, but it must be used with wisdom. It does not replace the teacher, but rather aids the teacher in teaching. Teachers are still tremendously needed for our students, and their personal mentoring is still of priceless value. Yet, along with these great blessings, the Facial Action Coding System could be added to better improve our academic world. The world needs educated men and women, and this Facial Action Coding System, innovated by Professor Thomas Huang, could be the exact element needed better educate our students, and make for a brighter future.","Dear Principal Students should be required to clean the community that reason is because half of the garbage is there's they need to be helping and cleaning up there mess not so others can do it for them plus it is good exercise and u still get to hang out with your friends. So yes i do think that students should be helping out by picking u garbage so ti can help the community and help the planet and make are school a little more better than what it is. By helping the community i think that we can make the environment around the school better such as other places at home. Cleaning up are litter will help with the problems at home u get to hang with your friends and you get to help the environment, it doesn't take time from anything cause you still get to hang with your friends play games and still have fun with the whole school. We can help the community in so many ways exercising , cleaning up the garbage doing a lot to help the community now that there has been a oil spill we can help those animals in need give them a brand new life. The tools we have today will make it better especial now that we have tons of students here and maybe those who help can have extra credit or meet new friends or maybe have new friends that we didn't even know we had in the school that existed because we hang out with the same people we made friends with. So cleaning up the school will not only help the school , but the wildlife, kids who are over weight and do not get out as much as your suppose to , help kids get along and share what they have in common. It will also give are school a better name than what it is and raise more money for schools equipment and uniforms. You might even have you parents come out and watch, just be helping out a little can make a big difference. The school needs to be cleaned and it needs to be done , You have free time so why don't we just help out a little and make a change in the community just a little will help everyone in need. we can have are sisters are family have a good time.      ","To TEACHER_NAME I think that policy 1 is a good policy. I agree that we should be able to bring our phones to school. There are many reasons why i think we should be able to bring our phones to school. What if there was an emergency and no-one was around you would need a phone. In your classes and you had nothing to do you could be texting on your phone because that is what the kids are in to these days. Some kids have there mom come and pick them up from school and after tutoring classes they would need a phone to call home and tell a parent. Cell phones are really good acceries for kid and adults. They give you something to do at all times. School is not a place for a cell phone but we should be able to bring our phones. If everybody cut there phones off during classes and would not play on them during class some teachers would get a lot more done. There would be one less thing to worrier about while your at school. From what you have noticed is that i like cell phones, and i think we should be able to use our phones at school. In case of an emergency or just boredom. We should be able to text on our phones at school. Like i said before it would be one less thing we would have to worried about at school is getting our phone taken away.","Technology has evolved in many ways over the years. Yes, this technology may be very good for our expanding environment yet do we really know the real cost technology may bring us? Does auto-driving cars seem right when there`s everyday hazardous drivers out in the world? In my perspective I`ve already seen on news, on the internet and in my own eyes cars and automobiles get torn up or pummeled together just because they forgot a turn or they didn`t stop at the right time. These cars may have innovated warning signals to alert the driver but what would happen if the warning was to late? Would we lose lives and supply that cars/trucks may be bringing? I rather have the least outdated technology then suffer a live and food or clothing that could`ve helped me and others. The cost of making cars that self drive may just be hundreds of dollars just to make a specific part thats needed in the vehicle. Maybe all together. But the real cost is those that may suffer injurys of a unexpected accident. They probably just lost themselves money that couldve been better spent. Perhaps other people may not mind that they lost a valuable car and can throw money like its nothing. But they don`t know the impact it has on themselves and others. If anything were to happen who will the law punish? Those that were in the car or those that it exist in the first place? It has already been declared that their are some states that banned any self-driving cars. I as a single person respect that. But, is it enough to let more states and cities still trying to invent/improve cars that can auto-drive? If its woth getting in accidents, losing money and maybe even losinga whole business then lets hope the new and improved self-drive car can make it into the future. In other words disaster is soon to come and I never would have thought that technology was meant to hurt others.     ","Dear State Senator, I believe the way this country was founded should remain the same. From laws, to printed documents of government and even electing our president. We should keep the Electoral college to vote for president. We should keep it the way it is for many reasons, this country was started that way, you vote in either democratic or republican party, and there are larger states then others with more people. There would be a whole lot of confusion if it was based on election by popular vote. This country was built by the Founding Fathers with a purpose, to be free, have rights, but built with certian laws and ways that are done by government. This country was founded with the system of Electoral College when voting for president. The story states ""The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" That statement means all the laws and ways of government that we have today for electing presidents was made by the founding fathers for a reason. Many people have certian beliefs and some aren't found in Democratic or Republican party for certain people. Some Republicans may believe in a certian way that some Democrats do not, and even the other way around. Because of the Electoral College, we can vote for a specific party that we agree more with their beliefs. We go through the slate electors that we agree more with and then vote for President. Popular voting would be difficult in another way because, there are larger states that the majority of people may believe in one way then another state that is tiny that believe in a whole other way. With states like California and Texasthat are huge states compared to Rhode Island and New Jersey that are tiny, the popular votes wouldn't be fair if the larger states believe in a differents way that the smaller states. It would be less difficult to just keep the Electoral College. Although both systems may have a confusing side, we were made as a country in certian ways of government. This country was started with the Electoral College. You vote through a slate with either Democratic or Republican party. Lastly, there are larger states then others so popular voting would be unfair. So I think we should keep Electoral College when voting for the President of the United States.         ","I'm a teenager myself, phones are very addicted. They are like a key part of our life. People use cellphones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, planning, internet browsing etc. Sometimes we like to do two or more of these things at once. Some people are choosing the wrong times to use their cellular devices. When they are driving. As a society we have became so focused on how much we can do at one time that we don't realize how it could be effecting our personal safety, and the safety of others around us. When driving its already pretty hard to stay focused on the road. Let alone with a handheld phone as a distraction. The roads are shared for everyone and not just you, don't let your dumb decision affect others life on the road as well. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if its causing us to be late to work school or whatever else it may be. In the article made by Consultancy Buss Maven Labs, Scott Clark says ""A young women killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone."" She may not have intended to end the poor boys life but now she has to live with that. Any of us could have been that poor boy riding his bike. Don't be selfish! There are many more ways to distract a drivers attention. Talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. Therefore, drivers have to operate the vehicle already. Why let a cellphone distract you trying to operate it at the same time? Cellphones while driving have caused thousands of wrecks across the world, some even leading to death upon the passenger or the people in the other car. Think before you pick up your phone behind the wheel. Is it worth it? Your life and anybody in the car with you lifes could be gone just so you got to send that text. Focus on what is more important, Getting to your destination. You can be on your phone another time. Hoped this helped you.            ",,,,,,,
404,494,"To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME Many students are complaining to teachers that they have nothing to do after school but play video games and hang out with friends and family I agree; 60 percent of students in our school just go home and do homework, their should be after school activities for kids who at least past with an 75 average in all academic classes. Not all kids can have higher than a B average in every classes. I think if students want to do after school activities and there grade is lower than a 75 they should first go to after school tutoring to get extra help and bring there grade up. Doing both of these things will keep kids with better knowledge and become more healthy by playing sports such as football, basketball, soccer and other kinds of sports students will stay out of trouble doing bad things like stealing and fighting. Over time kids will develop better social , mental , and physical skills. Our neighborhood around our school will be more safe and will keep a lot of kids off the streets and away from trouble. Kids will want to join sports and other activities. Please and thank you for your time. p. s your favorite student STUDENT_NAME","Have you ever looked at someone and thought, I wish I knew how they feel? Well now with the help of a new technology called Facial Action Coding System you can do just that. An article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" goes in depth about how the system works and what it does for society. Basically, this system shows you exactly what a face is feeling emotionally. I think this is a great idea and a step into the technology of the future. One reason why this system is great is it can show you exactly what emotions someone has. The system constructs a 3-D model of the face on the computer. It then compares the face to a face that is showing no emotion. The system then looks at your 44 muscles in your face to see how you are feeling. The system can even detect mixed emotions. Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois is the creator of this system and he says this about the system, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" Dr. Huang is explaining that this system can even detect if you are feeling multiple emotions by weighing different units. Another thing the Facial Action Coding System can do is recognize faces from paintings. The most recent piece of art they have studied for emotions was the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. After the process, they discovered that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Gettng these results can now tell us what painters from a long time ago were thinking about in there art when they painted it. This can be very useful in figuring out more ideas from artists in the rennisance age. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a great tool that can help out the future of emotions greatly. It can detect all emotions and even detect if someon had mixed emotions. It can also detect emotions in paintings like the Mona Lisa. I think this is a good idea and that it should be spread to the entire world.","Community services Dear, TEACHER_NAME i am sending you this letter in response to your requirement that all students do community services. In this letter i will tell you what I believe are the pluses and minuses of community services are. I will also tell you about what i think the overall decision should be to make all students happy. Let me start of with this I think community services are a good thing for kids to do in there spare time because it overall benefits all people in some way. So with that i know that some kids probably already do community services and some kids probably have never heard of community services. The benefits of community service are they help the people in need or help keep the earth a clean place to live. For example if you are helping out a homeless shelter you are helping out the homeless people to make there lives better. If you are cleaning garbage then you are helping save peoples lives because it stops polluting the air. So these are just two of the many ways that community service is good. I don't really think there are necessarily anything bad from doing community services but i think there are many kids in this school that after school the have to go to sports and then get home and have to do there homework and then on weekends they have family stuff or sports tournaments so they just don't have time to do it. So i believe that the overall best solutions is that you encourage kids to do community services and maybe have one day every month that the kids take two hours of school to go outside and clean up or go on a couple of field trip to homeless shelters or other places like that so that the kids fell good that the did something good for another person. And then they wont have to miss the other things they love to do something like that. Thanks for taking the time to read this letter Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME                  ","Dear principle, I am glad you are considering letting us use phones in our free times and I absolutely agree with that. we might can have a vote on the whole cell phone or not. As long as we respect the new rule and not use them during class time. I see no problem in using our phones in our free time. As long as we don't have any inappropriate items on it. I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school to use in our free time, as long as there turned off in class. because that is our free time and we should have the privilege of having them out. As long as we are responsible enough for them. like, we could have a strike system and if we get a certain amount of strikes then we wont be able to use them in our free time. That may also be another way of getting kids wanting to behave. So they can use their phones. It could also be a bad thing because the kids that are less fortunate might not have a cell phone. Or not even be able to afford a cell phone. kids might not understand their situation at home. That could make them feel bad or maybe even be picked on. We don't wont to start any drama because , we already have enough here. So, I guess I have mixed opinions about this situation.

I don't think we should like ban cell phones from school as long as we can use them responsibly and appropriately. -STUDENT_NAME","Are Driverless cars safe for the future? In the Article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it talks about how driverless cars is not an imagination for the future but how it's coming to a reality and how the idea is coming together. Even the company Google has starteed having cars that drive independently since 2009. But in my opinion, I believe that driverless cars are unsafe and that car companys should stick to manually driven vehicles. There are reasons that driverless cars are unsafe; they can't drive around complicated trafics issues and navigate through road work, and still need assistance of a human to navigate and drive the car, and repairing the roads to be suitable for these vehicles is costly. How can a car navigate around traffic and know what to do in the situation? The car doesn't have capability of a human mind to work through these problems. In paragraph 7 in the article it staes, "" But all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating work zones and arund accidents."" This proves that these vehicles don't have the capability of human skills and problem solving skills to work around these obstacles. Another problem with driverless cars is that there still needs to be a human driver on the wheel and to be alert at all times. There is no point on having driverless cars if the car can't succesfully drive itself without a human. These vehicles are still not equiped and aren't safe for the pasangers becuase the driver needs to be alert at all times and wouldn't it get boring not driving but just watching? Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver says, "" The drive psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" If it's really that much of a challenge then it most likely will be impossible to fix this problem. Lastly, another big downside of driverless cars is repairing the roads to a smart road system to accompany the drivrless cars. These smarter roads will make the cars safer and easier for the cars to navigate throught but it will be costly and every road would have to be repaired. In paragragph 3, Enigeers at Berkley stated, "" These smart-road systems worked suprisungly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This statement shows that these engineers are agreeing that is impossible to rebuild every road to accompany these vehicles for a safe ride. Driverless cars was an imagination of the past but has started becoming a relaity in our furture. But these cars should stay an imagination and have been proven to not be safe. Driverless cars still need a driver in the seat to take control in complicated siuations and it's too costly. Why have ""driverless cars"" when you still need a driver?      ","We as Americans have the right to vote for who we want to be president.  American citizens should be able to vote directly for the president, not for a state of electors.  This is why we need to abolish the Electoral College.  It is unreasonable, unfair, and unreliable to the people.  In recent times, the Electoral College has been known to have made mistakes on purpose and on accedent.  The Electoral College system that they have going now is very unorganized and needs to be changed.  It is about time that we change the way our citizens vote for our president.  This is a huge deal to our country considering the fact that the president is one of the most important people in the country.  We as American citizens should be able to trust that our vote was for the candate they chose. First of all, lets discuss the past issue that have happened withe Electoral College system.  The incident in 1960 with John F. Kennedy was a huge disaster.  As said in source 2 ""...The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.""  This is a perfect example of how the Electoral College is a misused way of voting.  They tried to basically sabatage Kennedy's election.  What about other problems that also occur with this system?  The voters can't always control who their electors vote for.  The confusion is a big key factor in the situations also.  voters can easily get confuse about the electors and they will accidently vote for the wrong candidate. The peoples rights.  Dont they have a right of who becomes president?  They should.  The Electoral College is taking away from the excitement of getting to make a huge decision on who will run the country.  When a teenager finally becomes eightteen, what do you think is on their mind?  Freedom.  And part of getting their freedom is getting to vote for their country.  The people should have the right to vote for whoever they may choose and trust that it went for the person they chose and not to a state of electors to vote for them.  It's in the facts that more people prefer to have a direct election.  The people think that it is unfair to their rights and we all believe that it is not the best way to decide who runs our country. Organization is a key factor in this country.  So why aren't we showing it?  The voting system that we use to this day is very unorganized and has many flaws.  The Electoral College is much to confusing of a system that we need to be using.  We need to change our system now while we can before we hit another mistake.  We need to take advantage of the freedom that we have in this country of ours and make a difference.  We can change this system so it is much easier and more reliable to vote from. The people want it, so it's about time that the government stands up and agrees with us on that point.  We can change our disorganization. Our country needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  I have discussed the problems our country has faced with Electoral College system, and hopefully it changes your view on what really is the right and better thing to do for our country.  Voting is a very big deal here in America and it is one of the ways it shows we have freedom.  The voting system would be much more organized if the system were changed to direct vote by the people.  That is the right way.  Its about time we change the system for the better.

So all this day of the wreck she was mourning, and after all day of being at my mom's house we were packing up and leaving just pulled out the driveway and over the train tracks. It was just getting dark outside I would have to say it was 6:30 and my sister pulled out her phone and all I here was her crying and I looked up and we where going around a sharp turn. Then everything was going in slow motion Like I can not even explain how none of us got hurt. The police showed up about 15 minutes later and they started asking everyone if they were ok, then the police walked up to sister and asked ""if she was on her phone"" and my sister said ""yes"" so they wrote her a ticket and it was a BIG ONE. So do not text and drive it will cost you!   ",,,,,,,
404,563,"Dear principle I understand that you would like to change the grade policy from C average to a B average for playing sports. I think this is a bad idea. we should have the limit be a C average because, not all students can foucuce as good as others, some students already know that they want to play sports for a living, and some students cant do everything at school. Not all students can foucuce as good as others. some students have very short attention spans. some students are really good at paying attention wile others may have something holding them back. When students have a lot on their mind, something bad has happened, or they have a disabilities that is making it so they cant fouscus that causes them so miss stuff in school so they don't quite know every thing. some students already know that they want to play sports for a living Some students already know that they want to play sports for a living. School is suppose to help you decide what you what to do as a career. If a student already knows what they want to do then having elective classes are completely pointless. Students should be able to decide if they want electives. Some students cant do everything at school. Some students may have ADHD or ADD with causes them to have a short attention span or not be able to focus and or pay attention. Other students may have a lot on their mind such as the death of a loved one or fights with friends. This may cause them to be distracted and not focus so they cant work. so again I understand that you would like to change the grade policy from a C average to a B average. I think this is a bad idea. we should have the limit be a C average because, not all students can focus as good as others, some students already know that they want to play sports for a living, and some students cant do everything at school.","This technology of reading into students emotional expressions for the classroom can be beneficial because it gives a more in depth look into how a student is feeling during a specific lesson rather than them saying they understand the lesson when they do not. This new technology may make it easier for classrooms because some kids dont like to speak up when they dont understand something and that does not help the student or teacher. So this new technology will keep the teacher up to date on how there students or feeling about the lessons. Some students assume it is easier to just not say anything at all when they dont understand something. Students dont want to be a hassle for the teachers to have to go back and go over a lesson so they end up not saying anyhting on there confusion. Also students just do not want to be the only classmate to speak up. Dr. Huang says "" A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This can help the teacher in order to realize what they can do to make the lesson more fun like helping the students engage more. Also this can just help the teacher know what they can go over in order to make the students understand certain lessons more. This technology can help more so with the teacher because it is there job to help students when they do not understand something and to make the classroom learning process easier. Dr. Huang predicts that ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would really help teachers alot in the sense that they dont have to worry about if anybody is behind in there class because everyone will be at there own pace on different levels of the lesson. Using technology to read students emotional expressions during class will be very beneficial to the teacher and students. This will help the classroom flow smoother because the teacher will not have to worry about who is caught up and there understanding, if the computer can figure out where the student starts getting confused or bored. Then mabey eventually the computer will be able to modify the lesson for peoples learning pace and understandment.   ","Dear Principle, This is one of your hundreds of students at the school. I asking about why students should be doing community service when they have lots of other thing to do. They should not have to do community service unless they want to. For example students who participate in sports don't have time with community service. On the other hand, some students like to do community service because they have nothing to do. I like to do community service from time to time but, I think you should ask the students if they want to perform community service. So my decision is, that you should ask the students before making them do community service. Let me ask you this, what would you do? I'm just saying. Let me just say one more thing, would you like to perform community service and waste your valuable time? So that's all I have to say. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear, Principal I agree with the first policy. I agree because i think that it is a fair deal that students can bring their cell phones but they have to turn them off during classes. It is fair because teachers wont get mad and complain about us using our cell phones in classes. I understand that it can cause a big problem on our free time but where i come from in my mind is that what if something happen to us or to the school. Teachers cant watch all of the children they don't know what will happen. All the teachers cant let all the children use their phone if its an emergency because i would believe that its over 200 students in the school that we are in. That is why i think we should be allowed to have phones and if we have free time you will think you can never get our attention if we are on our phones well i agree but its always not true. I think you will figure something out if you speak loud enough in the microphone, you will have everybody's attention. That is why i think we should be able to have our phones not because of free time but just in case of an emergency. I hope that you agree with me!! Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Would you owe a ""Driverless cars."" if possable? Driverless cars should be stopped from being created. Driverless cars sensors can suddently stop working and can cause an acsedent. They can also are not fully in control someone always have to be in alert and ready to take over. The also mentions 'safety is best enforce within alert drivers.""Driverless cars"" should stop being funded because it can cause an accident, a human will still have to be aware and ready to take over, and the law also states that. Driverless cars sensors are nothing new of course, but they may also fail at occations. When sensors fail at anytime it may cause an accident. If the person in the vihcle dose not know what is going on it may lead to a extream unfortinit case. It may leave the passengers extreamly hurt, or even worst it may lose a life. In which case we do not want to occure. Technollogy may fail. They are also not fully controlled on it is own. Someone always has to remain ready to take over when ever is needed. Why will someone want to do that when not having fully controlled or no controlled at all. People would offten lose sight of the road. People may also get annoyed. They also say that they may place cameras on vhicle to watch the driver stay foucesed on the road. If the car cannot do that on it's own i belive it should not be a car to be able to use. Lastly the law it's own belives that 'safety is best reenforceed with drivers alert. When only people think that it is not quite a big deal but when the law belives the same way it is something major. As that have been said most states it is illegar to even test a driverless car. Some of those states are The distric of Columbia, California, Nevada, and also Florida. Whitch i agree and it is a great idea to enforce. That is why Driverless cars should not be funded nor try to be created. Driverless car sensors may fail and can cause a tragic. They are also not self conntrolled on it's own. The law also said 'safety is best reenforce with alert drivers.' Would you still want to own a car like thing? I hope this changed your mind if so. ",I favor in to changing election by popular vote because it would be more fair to the people who are running and it would be quicker to decide who is president. I think its better to be elected by popular votes because people actually like the person for a reason and actually listening to what that person is saying and actually agrees what he saying and they see something in that person instead of just having congress vote count mostly instead of the citizens. And its not really fair that a person wins just because of his or hers own group of electors gets him to win it should just be based on popularity because its fair as i said before for example what if their was some person running for president and he was not really good to run the United States and yeah some people voted for him but he wasnt as popular but he won the election because of his group itb wouldnt really be fair because  the people perferd the other guy better in office. Why because ethier people liked what he had for the states n what he would offer to the people and actually help us live good and thats what is important for the state its all about the people wants because thats how we will live right. Also the person running for office might not have any electorial votes because theie campaigning wasnt heavy in a certain part of the state so they would oviously vote for the other person because they really havent seen what that person has to offer to them and he will have less succes in winning the election. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate witch means that they can relie on  their state as much so they really wouldnt pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by a popular vote but of course no voters vote swings a national election. And thats why I favor in popularity votes because its more fair for the canidates and its a better system in electing a president.            ,"Phones & Driving Essay People use their phones for just about everything such as texting, talking,and the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. But you cannot do these while driving. You can kill someone if you're not focused on the road. we have become focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our phones. Using a phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for some good reasons below according to the law. 1. Its illegal 2. You are much more likely to have a wreck 3. Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. According online 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 6 million accidents per year. Did you know 520 pedestrians were killed by distracted drivers in the United States in 2014. Moral of this essay you shouldnt drive and be on your phone it causes alot of people to be killed   ",,,,,,,
404,923,"Dear principle, I think that we should keep it at a C average because Some people that play sports stay at the average to play, and if you made it a B average then they would have to go to practice and go home and study and not have enough time to study. Then when they take the test they had to study for they wouldn't do so great on it them there average would go down. Then they wouldn't have a lot of people to play sports. Sports keep us active and in shape. It keeps us healthy if, students couldn't play sports then kids wouldn't be so healthy we would all be fat, and im sure we don't want America like that. I think a lot of people struggle to make B averages. A lot of people cant learn quicker than other. Some people need time to go home and study not stay up all night have a test fail it. Not be able to play or be lazy for the game. I would love for them to keep at a C average. C' s aren't that hard to make if you try, but if you don't have a lot of time to study then there isn't much possible chances to make a B average. Not a lot of people make B' s and A' s. I would hate for you to make it a C average. I wouldn't like it at all. Then they wouldn't pay to play a school sport, then the schools would have any money from they parents paying. Sports are for fun, and competitive. Something active to do. Something that make a person happy. I'm sure you wouldn't want to take that away. Im sure a lot of parents wouldn't be so happy for there child about this. The kid would be pressured to do better, then they would be able to do the sport, then they would get so caught up in it they would fail at keeping there grade up then they wouldn't get to play there hobbies. The sport they play could be something they want to be when they get older. They need lots of practice when they are younger to be a good player. This sport they play could be there carrier. Then they wouldn't have much of a chance to make it in a good collage they want to get in for there sport. I would love for you to keep it at a C average thanks.

I believe that the students should choose whether or not if they would like to clean trash or spend their time doing what they want to do. Some students might not clean litter but those students may be doing something else for the community. Furthermore, it should not take many people to clean much trash. Students may also be cleaning trash on their own time as well. People who tutor the elementary school kids, that is very nice, but some students also think it wastes time. Let those students choose to tutor or not. Some students may have important activities to do and cannot afford to waste that time. For example, some students have a sport team to go play with or practice. Others may have after school classes to attend to. Many students can help trash but there are many who cannot afford to do those stuff. The principal should not make all students require to help perform community service. Students who do other community service might have a lot of free time, but there are those who have little time to spend. There are those who might have a part time job, or helping a friend, or they have to do a lot of homework as well. These students have a lot to do so they cannot spend their time on community service.","Principle, I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school at lunch time but if you have them out during class you'll receive the normal punishment. What would be the point of not allowing students to have they're cell phones out during lunch? They are eating and/or talking to friends. Although, the only true downside to this is if your texting it does not always get to the other persons phone right away, depending on the amount of signal you or they have it could take 5 seconds or it could take 30 minutes. And because of that the students cell phone could ring in the middle of class and end up having them in detention with they're phone taken away. So as you can see in the first two paragraphs that there is a good thing and a bad thing about allowing students to have there cell phones out during school hours, or at least class room time, and with that being said why can't we also have our cell phones out during school dances, it would not be very different from lunch time and your after school. The only problem i can see by allowing this is if you drop your phone, leave it somewhere, or its been stolen. These things are not very big things to worry about but some of these things don't really have a complete point to, like the one for school dances in the last paragraph, it doesn't really have a reason why we can not have them out. Truly there has to be a really good explanation for not allowing this. Now for not allowing them in class I understand, the way I see it is because students will, most likely, most of their time texting or calling friends or family about what they are going to do after school. If this is allowed the this will probably happen, the students will not pay attention, they will not learn, won't get their homework finished, they might get held back a grade, not graduate, not go to college, won't get a very good job (that they actually like to do), from then on their are a few more problems and all because the school allowed cell phones in class, but that doesn't mean that this will happen to everyone some will actually want to pay attention, finish homework on time, and so on. But luckily schools don't allow phones out whenever the student wants to text his/her friend but maybe at lunch or at school dances. Now throughout this response i have said/typed what I think is, in a way, best for the school and that is to carry out with the no cell phones in school policy. Because the student might lose his/her cell phone or other electronic device.                  ","Driverless cars may be coming in our future, but they most likely will not be commonly used. Driving a car run by a computer allows a number of problems to occur. Since 2009, driverless cars have been around. These cars are only considered driverless under certain conditions though. If the car is not reliable in all traffic conditions, people should not rely on them to get them where they need to go safely. Society today relies on technology and computers for almost everything from talking to friends to sending military signals hundreds of miles. At times, even the most advanced technology glitches. Driving a car that is controlled by technology would pose the same problems. Would the car still drive if it started raining? What would happen if the rotating sensor on the roof glithched? A driver, assuming the car is driving, may not be attentive and see the signal given by the car for the human to take over. The car could crash causing even bigger problems than just faulty technology. Crashes occur even when human drivers are in control of the car. It is inevitable that crashes are likely to happen in the autonomous cars as well. Paragraph 9 states that, ""in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" If these driverless cars are better than having a human behind the wheel, most states would allow them to be tested. Even if they were tested and allowed to be driven new laws would have to be put into place. In the case of an accident, would drivers or manufacturers be at fault for the accident? Drivers might claim that they did not see the signs that the car gave them signifying that the human was supposed to take over. Manufacturers would argue saying that the driver was unattentive to their surroundings. Drivers who rely on computer driven cars may loose the skills needed to drive a car over time. If they do not drive in favorable conditions, because the car is driving, how will the manufacturers expect them to be able to drive in hazardous conditions. Practice makes perfect; without practice, a driver will not be close to perfect. Switching to cars being driven by humans in times of unstable conditons could potentially cause more accidents. Driverless cars might sound like a fantastic idea. When the different risks are taken into consideration, a human life should be more important than not having to drive. The reliability of the autonomous cars is not strong enough at this time to be considered safe. Humans should keep driving cars and computers should stick to sending text messages.","Dear state senator, We should definitely strive in keeping the electoral college for so many reasons. We need to keep the electoral college because it serves so many purposes in the united states. It hepls us decide who our president and vice presidents will be and it is a big help on our state workers. And most of the reason that people want to stop it is because they think that some of the nominees arent getting what they deserve. We do understand that they put a lot of work in trying to become president but not everyone can win. And to be fair, after the presidential election is over, our govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candiates who ran for president in our state along with the names of their respective electors. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors. Having this Electoral College is so much help to our state workers. They dont actually have to do everything now...thanks to the Electoral College. So please strive to help keep the Electoral College. sincerely, PROPER_NAME            ","Although cell phones have not been about for a really long period, they have turn into a significant part of our lives. People have their cell phones for about everything, e. g., Texting, speaking, schedule thinking, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we may still do two or furtherer of these feelings simultaneously. Alas, people are also selecting the wrong moment to take using their cell phones: While they are taking. As the country, We have grown therefore concentrated on how some we will do in once that we are prepared to seek our own safety, too as the safety of others because we can' 't put down our cell phones. Using the hand-held cellphone while driving is harmful to the driver themselves for a few good reasons. One much fact is the number of accidents caused by this type of technology. Some states have created certain cases of cellphone usage prohibited for drivers while they are running motor vehicles. Some of these bans refer just to texting, and some bans refer to all handheld cellphone usage. Some people contend that all cellphone usage by drivers is harmful and that all usage by drivers should thus be censored. Should the government completely ban all cellphone usage for drivers while they are running motor vehicles? Could cut down on distracted driving, could decrease accidents, save lives, getting calls may take just as distracting as texting, And could send the message that no distractions are good while taking. Is it really that important to keep the cellphone while taking it? Some drivers nowadays have their cell phones while driving and find it as a harmless act. Cell phones are today not just the form of communication, but also a distraction and harmful component. People believe that checking their phone while driving is only a fleeting activity and doesn't be, yet it may make less control the vehicle and less power to focus which leads to very serious consequences. Regardless of what period this driver is or how skilled they are, under no condition should they be using their cellphone while taking. Drivers recognize that cellphone use is incorrect while driving and even they do it anyway. The University of Utah's Applied Cognition lab discovered that the response of the operator of the vehicle while on the phone is equal to somebody that is legally drunk (Hanes ). -losing Chart College Students' dependence on cell Phones While walking to and from the course on the field it is nearly impossible to reach the end with out looking at the fellow course mate using a cell phone in some way.

509,109,"Have you ever thought its time for change? Germany, New York , Columbia , and the United states are trying to reduce cars driven. Many benifits are coming from the downfall of cars being driven. Less stress, no smog from pollution, and less money spent on expensive cars. Vauban's streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter says she is less tense and much happier without a car. Walking, bycicling, and hyking are much more eco friendly. In 2006 a trend is growing in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents may be the most expieriment in low car suburban life. Car ownership is allowed but there are few places to park large garages and the edge of development. 70 percent do not own cars and 57 percent sold cars to move to Vauban. Car pollution is at its all time high, in paris motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home due to smog. 67 percent of vehicles in France use diesel fuel. Only 53.3 percent make up the rest of western europe. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases, and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states. Chicago to Shanghai people tend to make their homes which is a huge reduce of green house gas emissions from tailpipes. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years pass. Americas love for vehicles seems to be coolig down. The number of miles driven dropped in 2005 and continued droppimg steadily. In 2013 the number of miles driven was nearly 9 percent below its peak. If this persists there will be beneficialimplications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Last year a study was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. This is why life today would be fantastic and more benifitcial with car free cities and more walking, bycicling and hyking. less stress, less pollution, and less money spent on cars. As days continue the percentage of cars and miles driven decreases drastically.                                    ","My Claim About The Author Idea That Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's more important because it's the closest planet next to Earth and it gets more attention then the other planets because it's closer to us humans I jus feel like that's the more important planet & it's value, but my explantion about my claim in this article. In the article it says Venus is referred to as Earth ""twin"" and it's the closet to Earth & the also call Venus the ""Evening Star"" its the brightest light in the night sky and a another fact I can say it's in between the Sun and The Earth and I think thats why it make it so special even though Mercury is Closer Too The Sun and in the text it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system and Venus haves features that are analogous to those on Earth so in my opinon Venus has almost alot of things to do with or deal with Earth.","Would you wanttolive in a world where driving is now done by computers? I mean, wouldn't that just be sweet? Well, I'm going to let you on a little secret that I call the ""Three Part Series"". This world would be dangerous, promote laziness, and would be quite expensive. Firstly, this invention would be dangerous. Not only would these computers have to be programmed to completely analyze and control the road, but new laws will have to be published for these driverless cars. In paragraph 9, it says ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" which over all make you stop and think. If this tecnology fails or makes a mistake, who is at fault, you the driver or the manufacturer? Will driving tests still be required in case of an emergency or will everyone lack the knowledge of driving? It's so dangerous that California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia has started to limit the use ofsemi-autonomous cars. Secondly, this invention will not only promote laziness but bring about other inventions that will promote computer controlled programs. These cars will provide a better respose and control than a human, like it says in paragraph 5, so will this push us to be less aware of the roads and dangers of accidents? You might say ""what's so bad about that?"", well not only are you losing your everyday self-awareness but you're allowing yourself to become lazy. No longer will your attention be on the road but instead focused on the lastest updated picture of Justin Bieber, while you drink a sweet tea from the dollar menu. Sooner or later you'll be the girl/boy everyone has seen give their clothes to a robot to wash them or your kitchen to a robot who cooks for you. Lastly, not only will you be lazy, but, you'll be broke too. In 2000, ""Radar"" or these driverless cars we're estimated to cost 200 million dollars. I don't know about you, but I know there's no way I'll be spending 200 million on driverless car when that's all I'm estimated to make for a LIFETIME. With the price of this car, I can imagine how much money these companies will be needing just to manufacturer one set each of these cars. So, just take a minute and think how money these companies are going to blow that can be used towards something else, like charity,at-risk neighborhoods, homeless shelters or even just rehab centers. So, ultimately you'll be spending more on this car then you'll make in a lifetime or even spend in a lifetime. In conclusion, I would like to say that I still agree and stand by my ""Three Part Series"" or TPS for short. As you can see, not only will this car be inefficient but it will be expensive, dangerous, and will promote laziness. So the next time you might think this will be a great idea, remember the engraved ""Three Part Series"".","Dear, TEACHER_NAME I agree with your new policy for having a grade B average because then you make the students push themselves so they can reach there full potential. Even thought i have a grade C average i can make it so that i get it up to a B. For children that have a grade C average and they play sports they can stay after to catch up on papers or they can get extra help by asking there teachers. Another thing that can help then is they can study the classes that there not doing well on even if its 5 to 10 minutes a night it will hep them. They can also go home online to look at what homework they have and do it ahead of time so you are not rushing. Next reason i think it is a good idea for that policy is so that people that need help or have a grade C average will work to get it a B. Which means that they have better grades to get into college with and for the sport if they want to they can try and get a scholarship. Even thought there are some bad things about the policy there is a lot of good things to this policy they can also get to have more privileges with school if there grade are up. i appreciate that you might make this a policy because it makes me push myself to the full potential i can be and that makes me feel good. Scincearly , Your student","The Electoral College consists of 528 electors. in order for the popular vote tobe valid, an Electoral Colege should continue as is. The Electoral College is a wide range of people who  know what it is thta they want. The Disrrict of Columbia is even considered to be a state just for the Electoral College purpose. The people of America choose their electors in which when they choose their Presidential candidate, they are choosing it's electors. The people of America are practically setting themselves up for whatever outcome comes into play. Some people claim that people are not voting for the president, but are voting for the slate of electors. These people, however, are simply dramatic and have no sense as to what is actually going on in their country. People do no tvote for a president just because of his or her electors. Presidents are elected because they, as a candidate to be a president, have somehow persuaded the majority of the country to vote for them on their own behalf. A good president is elected because he or she is a good president, not because he or she has good candidates behind them. Yes, with a president comes his or her electors, but the electors are not the ones running for president, therefore they are not the ones persuading the people of America to vote for them, for it is the president that is doing the persuading, and the president that is receiving the votes. The Electoral College has worked for many many years in the past and if held with respect will continue to work an be a successful way and form of voting. The outcomes will be valid and the responses will be accurate with reasonableactions following it. The disaster factor is a claim that goes against the Electoral College, however it is not worthy of being a factor. A tie in the Electoral College is not likely, and if it were to happen, it could easily be resolved.    ","""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a great way to see if someone is happy. It can possibly help others to see the person in front of them and what their emotions are or what that person is 'trying to hide' It's all about muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (the muscles that begin at the cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around the eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being thruthful. Making a fake smile can also help produce a real one. Practicing with putting a pencil across your mouth works the same muscles as when a person is smiling for real. This project does help in forms that can tell when someone is being sad, happy, disgusted, surprised, angry, fearful, and/or sad. ",When your asking for advice it is good to get multiple opinions. Its is good because if you only ask one person they could tell you to do the wrong thing or something bad. Also if you only ask only one person they could be telling you to do something thats to nice. If you ask multiple people for their opinion and advice it gives you more variety of opinions so you can pick the best choice. It is always better to get multiple opinions when asking for advice. Lets say you ask your a random person for advice and your mom and dad for advice. Your mom and dads advice will most likely be better than the strangers advice. The stranger doesnt know you and probably wont care what you do. Your mom and dads advice will be better because they know you and will probably want you to make the right choice. Thats why it is always better to get multiple opinions when asking for advice. If you were in a store and people were stealing if you ask multiple people what to do their responses could be completely different. If you ask one person what to do they could say that you should join them a steal with them. If you ask a different person they could tell you to tell somebody that those people are stealing. Another person could say to just get out of there and get away from those people. So now that you have multiple peoples opinions now you can make the better choice. If you would have only asked the first person for their advice you might have went and stole with them because thats what they told you to do and you didnt ask any other people for their advice. Thats why it is always better to ask for multiple opinions when asking for advice. Say you are at a party and people are doing drugs. If you ask a good friend what you should do if you are getting pear pressured to do drugs a good friends advice would be for you to say no and not to do the drugs. If you ask somebody else they might tell you to do it with them. If you didnt ask that good friend for their advice you could have done the drugs and gotten hurt. Thats why it is very important to get for multiple opinions when asking for advice so now you can make the right choice. So whenever you are in a bad situation and you need advice make sure you always ask for multiple opinions. If you ask for multiple opinions you have a better chance of making the right choice. If you are asking strangers for advice ask at least five people they might just say something random because they dont know you. If you are asking family for advice you should ask at least two people because you still need to get multiple opinions but they care about you more that and stranger do so you dont need as many opinions. These are all reasons why when asking for advice it is better to ask for multiple different peoples opinions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,,,,,,,
509,235,"Do you ever wonder why Earth is polluted? Well Earth is polluted because the amount of car ussage their is in Earth. If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason for not using cars is that you can save money by not buying gas. Another reason is that you can walk and it is a great way to exercise. Last but not least is you can stop air pollution. If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason is you can save money by not buying gas. What I mean by this is that gas now a days are pricy. So when your not using your car you save money. Also gas is what causes air pollution. Gas stays in the air and kills our environment like our oxygen and trees etc . If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason is that you can and it is a great way to exercise. What i mean by this is that some people are lazy to exercise so people just sit down. But with out their car they'll have to walk to their destination. Also when you walk alot you loose caleries and you start getting muscles on your legs. If we can lower the percentage of people using cars we can stop air pollution. One reason is you can stop air pollution. What I mean by this is that the gas that we put in our cars goes out in the air. With air pollution it can make us loose our oxygen. Also it destroys our trees that we need for oxygen. That is why we need to the percentage of car usage. In conclusion, if we can lower the percentage of people using cars then we can stop air pollution. One reason for not using cars is that you can save money by not buying gas. Another reason is that you can walk and its a great way to exercise. Last but not least is you can stop air pollution.    ","The author did a pretty good job explaining everything about Venus and all of this stuff about outer space. He said some very powerful things within this artical that should be changed in this wolrd and some should not be changed. The way he put everything into his own thoughts before just outting it out in the wolrd he had done a lot of reaserch about all of Venus and the planets. I well enough think that he did a very good job at explaining everything about Venus and how the earth works. When the author states "" our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edge"" he is saying that even if there is danger in this world you shoudl never run away form it you should take a risk. The authour has some very good points on why you shouldnt be scared of this earth and all the new things happening with Venus and all the planets. When the author was talking about the computers we should use on the planets and the new hovering saftly to the planets instead of taking rocket or a plan. That would be a good idea to try because with the hovering system you can get closer to the planets more than you can if you take a rocket or a plan all the way up there. It may not be as safe as taking a rocket up there because tou are more open being able to get hit by things up there. But with the new technology he is trying to use and to bring back that could honestly work becase the computers and tech that we are using today you cant take up there becasue there are no cell towers. What the author is trying to do is a good idea and they way he explained everythung was super good to because he had so many reasons on what you could do to make it easier on everyone that has to go up in outter soace and work. He had a reason to back up everything that he was saying anf that is what is going to make people think that this is a good idea to start using diffrent things in this world. ","Driverless car's isn't safe baceuse there are to may things that can go wrong. Or someone could get badly injured or even die from a drivless car. And in the article it also says what car is really the safest."" The only safe car has human control at all times.""And if there was an accident with one of these car going wrong it would be extremly hard to find who's fault it really is. It also says in the articel that ""If the technology fails and someone getting injured,who is at fault the driver or the manufacture.""That is why in most places in the United States baned people from testing these cars.""In most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" So really these cars is a big accident waiting to happen And the only person peopel can blame is the driver for buying the driver less car. That is why I would not buy or drive one of these cars because there unsafe and dangorious to the public.","There are a lot of obese children in this generation. You cannot take away sports even if their grades are low. It is unfair and we need to exercise. We need P.E. because it is important for a lot of unhealthy children!! We need all the exercise and fun. If we don't exercise then we will continue to be obese and lazy. Not having exercise isn't going to make us do better on our grades! Being healthy helps us focus, eat better, and concentrate more on our grades. Trust me, those who aren't getting exercise won't have better grades. Even if you only give the Grade A and B averages exercise it wouldn't be fair for all the other students that have low grades. It wouldn't be fair whatsoever. This is uncalled for, just ripping away exercise to kids who need it, but have extremely low grades! You should be ashamed of yourself for even considering not letting kids have what they need! Sure lot's of people say you don't NEED exercise, but honestly we all do actually need it. We need to have the running, and strength that our gym teachers provide us. And just forcing it away because of lousy grades, which we can fix easily, is just cruel! Gym helps build muscles. When you take it away because of grades, not only are you letting kids become obese, but you are also taking away what strengthens them. Their legs won't be any good because they will be too weak. They can hurt themselves when they finally get good grades and randomly start exercise. They need to start from the beginning like everyone else to build up strength like everyone else. Don't take away what we need the most. I beg of you, do NOT take away our exercise, strength, and fun! Its cruel and unusual punishment to make a child suffer! We are suffering when we aren't getting exercise! Obesity is striking America everywhere! When you take away sports then you are just helping the obesity problem grow!! Please don't do this! For the sake of us, the kids! Don't take away what we hold dearest! We cannot help it if we aren't good in math or algebra! Instead of taking away things, get special classes for after school, make time for a study hall and send the kids that need a little help to a class for extra learning. But taking away sports is just plain unfair!! Listen to reason and don't go through with this plan.","Would you want your vote for the U.S. president to count? More than likley  everyone said yes, if so then why would we keep the electoral collage as it is right now?  Did you know that when you vote for the U.S. president it goes directly to the electoral collage and your actually voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. according too, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" from Mother Jines by Bradford Plumper. Other things being rqual a larger state will get more votes than a smaller state. in Florid in 2012 when obama won the electoral election by only 3 votes also a victory in Wyoming in the same margin. Also all larger statees get more attention from the presidential candates. If we keep this going how it is eventualy are vote arent going to even count it will all be up to the electoral college. When casting your vote your vote you should know that it may not count because the elecoral college is supossed to count and seperate the votes and vote for a specific one but tecnically anybody from the electoral college can cast their vote for anyone they choose. If you were to look at wyoming and Californias votes California would have an unbelivably amout more votes casted than wyoming would. Thats simply because acalifornia is a much bigger state and can easily get 35 million voters while Wyoming can only gwt 500,000 voters which lowers Wyomings chance of  getting the president they would like too have. anf to equal theese out thee electoral college would have a group of people that would vote for a specific person but here this becomes an issue is when the electoral  college vote for whom they want to vote for instead of eho they are told to choose for and it makes the voting unequal. Keeping the voting system hoe it is right now is a verry bad idea and something needs to be done about it. It is not fir for bigger states to hhave a higher advantage of getting the president of their choice, and the smaller states have  a less of a chance of getting who they may want. Do you want you vote for the U.S. president to count? i know i sure would.                                         ","I agree that this technology is hepful, I believe it can help a lot of different people in many ways. I believe that this could be helpful because some kids/adults go through hard times and turn to death as an option. Many others may not agree with this technology because they don't want help nor do they want their emotions being able to be detected. This type of technology could help others in a various amount of ways. Here are some examples, a kid at home could be upset and the parents will never know because they don't pay attention to their childs emotions. The parents would be required to do an everyday scan so they are aware of their childs emotions. Some parents could find out how their kids really feel and get them help. This technology could keep the suicide rate from uprising. Doctors could use this in their offices to help patients. Especially infants, infants can't state how they feel. The doctor could scan the babies face and see their emotion. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" Those six emotions detectors could be very helpful. Who knows they might even come up with more emotions to detect. This could help large amounts of people. So I agree with this technology.   ","Do you think others thoughts are worth hearing? Would you trust someone else's opinion? These are some questions for you to think about. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and will have better thoughts on different situations. You're getting someone else's perspective. This gives another persons opinion on the situation. Another persons opinion almost always overrides your own because they are giving you a different thought in your mind and it makes you second guess your own thought. It's a reliable source to use when you are in a tight spot. A reliable source is something or someone that you can trust to be right and it helps get great information out of. This gives you better ideas on how to do things differently. Sometimes better ideas that others say is all you need because if you have a better idea on how to handle things differently you have a better solution. A different perspective is like good cop bad cop they look at things differently. You have a dependable person to talk to. Sometimes all someone needs is to be heard. Good listeners are always a good thing because they will listen to the things you say and will try to problem solve. Someone you trust and know will help you out. Almost all the time a person you can trust is the right person to talk to because you know they won't judge you and will help you clear things up. Someone you can rely on even if you are in a rough spot. A person that is reliable and you know you can depend on them for anything is always a keeper because they are the people who will help you make the right choices and will keep you on the right path. Having a dependable person is like having a conscious it will tell you right from wrong. Dozens of peoples opinions are not always reliable. However, some people might say that a lot of people are not always a reliable source. It depends on who you chose to get advice from. People who you don't trust or depend on. These are the people you should not get advice from because they are not a dependable source and you do not know if they will lead you down the wrong path. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and you will have better thoughts on different situations. People who chose to make better choices and ask others for help succeed in life more than people who don't. Better choices lead you down a successful path and asking others for advice when you think something is wrong is the first way to get there.             ",,,,,,,
509,494,"Should we give up our cars in order to live a better life? That's the question on everyones mind right now , but it's a no brainer! Places all over the world have done this as an experiment and it seems as if they like the results. Here are a few key points from passages that will help persuade you into joining the idea of getting rid of cars. Vauban, Germany has given up their cars for a better and healther life. So many families in Vauban have given up their cars that 70 percent of them don't even own a car! The reason why Vauban did this is because they realized that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and more than triple that amount in car-intensive areas in the United States. Looking on the bright side of this since there is less space for parking stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. If you want to drive a car you can always buy a small area for $40,000 that also comes with a house where you can park the car which would have to be a hybrid. Paris did the same thing that Vauban did but in a different way. On Monday mototrist with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Of course there were people who didn't obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine; however, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The only exceptions were plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers since they didn't really affect the pollution as much as cars that use up a lot more gas. Doing this cleared the smog for some time in Paris, in fact, so much of the smog cleared that the French party was actually able to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. Instead of making a law BOGOTA, Colombia , created a program called car-free day where millions of Colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to do whatever they had to do. The goal of this program was obvious, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Violators faced $25 fines). For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event of having no cars except for taxis and busses. By Bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved of this idea and have turned uneven, pitted sidewalks into broad, smooth sidewalks. Along with the new improvements, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared. In conclusion, getting rid of cars permitly or even just for a day or a week seems like a good idea. Lots of the people mentioned above highly approve of this and say that it actually makes them a lot happier and stress free. Of course the people who don't approve of this idea are the ones who were fined for driving on a no drive zone. All in all i still recommend this idea if things in Florida start to get out of hand and we must resort to something.    ","The author say that venus is called the ""evening star"". venus is actually a planet. venus is the second sun planet from the sun. also venus is the twin of earth. venus is one of the closest planets to earth. both has the same density and size. venus mission is was unmanned and no spacecraft survived the landing no spaceships arrived on venus for ""3 decades""many factors said that venus is an challenging planet for humans to study .planet temps are up to 800 degrees fahrenheit. the atmospheric pressure is is 90 times greater .venus has the hottest surface tempture then any planet there is. it presents additional impedimits like natural desaters .for example strong eartquakes and erupting valcanoes .

Experts have said that they are still developing this technology and they are not completely driverless. I feel that they may never be completly driverless. They just don't have the right technology to make this idea work. I believe that this is a bad idea because it is not safe, it's pointless, and there would be no relaxation. The driverless cars may seem like a good idea to others, but the manufactures cannot be sure that the car won't have serious problems when driving itself. I would not want to be in a car that could drive itself on an interstate and then suddenly stop working and cause a severe car crash. I understand that they are atill developing this technology and that they are still testing these vehicles, but I also think they should keep them away from public roads until they develop the technology they need. These cars are not quite ready to have passengers. They may one day be the great thing everyone imagined, but we are not there yet. Not only are these cars unsafe but they are really pointless. If you bought a driverless car thinking you would never have to drive or at least think that the car would drive itself most of the time, you would be mistaken. There is no point calling a car driverless if it isn't. The price of these cars would most likely be extremely high. You would be sadly disappointed if you spent alot of money for a car that says it can drive itself when really you do still have to drive in certain situations. Most people would think that they could let the car take control and that the passenger could just sit back and relax. Unfortunately, you can't. The car still requires you to be aware of your surroundings and have at least one hand on the wheel. You may ask how can they tell if you are following these rules. The answer to that question is that they would have a camera that would be able to detect if you are paying attention or not. They would also have sensory triggers in your steering wheel that lets them know if you have your hands on the wheel. If you were driving for a long time and you wanted a break for a little while then the car could take over, but you aren't really getting a break because you still have to pay attention in case something were to happen. Driverless cars may one day be a gigantic break through for industry and technology. Until that day comes when they can completely drive themselves withought needing a passengers assistance, there really is no point in buying them. The saftey, pointlessness, and lack of relaxation makes these cars unprepared for passengers and being out on the open road. They still lack many aspects that must be met before they are ready for use.      ","Dear principal, If you decide to only let students with a B average play on sports teams then you would encourage students to do better in school, and also teach them that they should do the best that they can also that their grades shouldn't be lower that a B average. People with a low average should be rewarded doing things that they like to do because then they will think its okay to have low grades because no matter what your going to let them play on the sports teams. That should be a reward to play on the sports team. Also kids would try harder to in school if you only let B average students play. You will encourage students to do better by not letting them get away will bad grades and being able to play on a sports team. You would also encourage them by showing them responsibility on doing their work and trying their best to succeed in school. That's really important too. So you'll have more students with a high average then low because most students in school like to play sports and some will do just about anything to be on the teach. You should reward students for having bad grades and if you let low average students play sports then you'll show them that no matter they do they will get away with not doing work or trying their best. In sports you have to try your best to win in school it's the same because you have to try your best to get the grades you deserve. If you reward students with low grades doing sports then they aren't trying their best or getting the grade they deserve. You'll have more students with a good grade then you will with a bad grade because if you reward students with good grades then you'll get more students wanting to get better in school then you will if you just let students with bad grades play sports. I hope you that you will see that it would be better if you let students with a B average play because then your going to have students want to do better so they can play sports in school. Also the students would learn to be responsible for their work and they would also learn that if they try their best then they would get the grade they really do deserve. Thank You, Student","The Electoral College shouldn't stay the same, in fact we shouldn't even have it anymor the reasons why we should not keep the Electoral College is because we are voting for electors, the tie that occurs in a election and representatives in states. There is so many problems with our constitution and the Electoral College is one of them. You may not think voting is what it seems to be. We don't vote for our president like we should but instead we vote for electors, in which all the electors in that state gives the president their vote if the majority of the population voted for them. Wouldn't it just be easier if can automatically add up all votes for each president since we are so technologically advanced? I say we just let the people of the United States vote the way we should vote and everything would be easier and there would be less complaints. A tie that occurs in an election is unfair. The House of Representatives is now responsible for the election. The winner-takes-all is also a big problem. The eclection is basically in the ""Swing"" states because the election is so close. So i guess the smaller the better. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Says Bradford Plumer in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" The biggest problem in he electoral college is the representatives in the states. ""Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much asthe 55 representatives from California, who represents 37 million,"" Says Bradford Plumer in paragraph 12. That makes no sense at all. Why would a smaller state with a smaller population have more votes than a bigger state with a larger population? That is unfair to the citizens of the United States and is unfair in the election. My arguement for this voting process could continue on. Agree or disagree, you still know that there are tons of problems wrong with the Electoral College. I hope one day it'll change and less talk and arguements will occur, it's time for a new voting process.    ","I am against technology being able to read students emotional expressions. We shouldn´t have computers telling exacly how our students are feeling. Some things are personal and some kids might not want other kids to know if there feeling sad, mad, or happy. In paragraph one it tells the percentages on Mona Lisa, that going way to far with personal space and thought. Some things are meant to be un said and if a teacher asks you in class how you felt about that certain situation they can tell if your lying or not, and that´s your choice if you want to express that. Students could be bullied if other kids didn´t like there opinion about something. Even if something made a kid feel happy that something bad happened to another student like personal thoughts , that could be blown out of context. Even though you may not have the brightest look on your face doesn´t mean your not happy, like thousand of kids walk around school with bleh looks and they may actually be happy but just showing that expression, but the computer would read it as sad or mad. Computers are already taking over a lot of things, but when it comes to humans we should´t need a computer to tell us how were feeling. Computers and technology aren´t 100% right, only you would know exactly how your feeling. In conclusion computers shouldn´t be allowed to read students expression. In paragraph 5 Dr. Huang says it isn´t hard to tell whether a friend is feeling happy or sad you should be able to read that, so why exactly do we need a computer doing that? Some things us humans should be able to figure out because its our body and we know how it works. Therefore we shouldn´t need technology going pass our personal boundaries and telling us how we feel . It would just cause more conflict and more wasted money on things we ca just figure out ourselves.","Why people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person. When they are asking more than one person for advice they are usually seeking for multiple opinions about your topic. Because gives people better ideas, asking more experienced people, or helps people feel more prepared. Sometimes people ask for multiple people advice. Sometimes asking multiple people is better than asking one person how to do it. For example you have a essay on the 1960's, you have called your relatives that lived during that time period to help me with ideas and after me and my relatives discussed we changed our topic too something better. Well discussing with multiple about there ideas and opinions makes people change it to something even better. Asking experienced people who has been there done that rather than someone who inexperienced. Someone who is experienced is someone who has been at that point and has accomplished it. Asking advice too some one who is inexperienced and doesnt know as much is like this time when I was playing basketball tournament, I asked my dad for advice on how to score on this team his advice didnt work, then asked my coach who played the same position as me in high school and his scheme worked perfectly. Most of the time asking someone who is more expireneced tells you what a better decision there is. Finally by asking for multiple people opinions you feel prepared and ready. When you are asking for multiple people advice it feels like you are ready and when just asking one person you feel iffy about it and you dont want to do it. One time I did a public speaking at my school, it felt like I was going to fail this but lucky enough that my friends have already done it and gave me advice at being up at the podium and I did fine. Sometimes by just asking your friends for advice can make you feel prepared and ready to go. In conclusion asking for advice from someone who is experienced rather than someone who doesnt know as much as them in a certain topic, asking advice from more people gives you ideas or more opinions, and asking more people about there topic makes them feel prepared. Someone that ask for multiple opinions/advice can help someone make better choices.",,,,,,,
509,563,"To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. Automibles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution. Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has acheived these and so much more. Their streets are essentially car-free and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance (Source 1 Par 6). Simlarly-yet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a car-free day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaruants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving (Source 4 Par 28). these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting autombile usage can do even more. A limit in automible usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollution-seeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally autombile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants (Source 2 Par 10). France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles (Source 2 Par 15).  By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails. Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.    ","Being able to go on Venus would be great thing but we can not do that. This author explains how it might be done. Do you ever wonder if there is a planet out there just like earth? Venus could be that planet, the only problem is we cannot land on it. In paragraph 2 the author states "" offten refered to as Earth's twin, Venus is the clostest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance.""those are some facts about Venus and Earth. in paragraph two it also states "" humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world . Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survided the landing for more than a few hours."" The author explains how they have tried sending spacecrafts up too venus but have not worked very good. The author goes on very well too expalin how it would be very hard and how it would be bery hot and hard conditions too land there. The author brings up something from nasa that could work and he agrees on, in paragraph 5 it states "" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for semdimg humans to study Venus. NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. How this paragraph makes the author better is because he is researching it and comparing it too his idea. This idea would not be easy buy if it can work there is a chance we can still study venus and one day have humans land on it.","The concept of driverless cars has been a rather popular idea for decades now. However this concept seems to be getting further from being a concept and closer to becoming a reality in the past decade due to companies such as Google taking the wheel on research. However, as with anything shiny and new like a brand new car, there has to be some sort of counter agrument against it. Why do we need it? Will we be able to afford it? Will it run over the dog trying to back out of the driveway? These are only a few arguments that can be made against this new type of vehicle. One of the biggest arguments that can be made against driverless cars would be the overall safety they present. With the cars, they would (obviously) be able to drive themselves. How would they be able to drive on the unpredicatable roads? Would they know to stop for the skunk in the road or the toddler running across the street? Would they know exactly when to brake so they don't ram into the car in front of them? There are so many driving hazards that could come that we aren't exactly sure where to start. After all, no matter how well the cars are put together and how much research goes into making them work as well as possible, even the best technology still has it's bad days. What would the driver's job in this be? To look pretty until the car reaches it's destination? If the car where to need assistance of the driver,would the driver be able to take back control without a moment's notice? Most every kind of technology uses some sort of software to keep it functioning, and with that software come necessary maintenence and updates. How would the software keeping the car functioning work? Would you buy the car and have to hope and pray that driving laws and regulations don't change from the time you buy the car to the time it's time to buy a new one? Would you be able to connect your car to your home internet and it update itself once it's not being used? If that's the case, what would happen if the update where to disagree with your care and then the car would perform poorly upon the next usage? These are only a few of the arguments that I can make at the present time without more information on these cars. Yes, I realize that most of these arguments are hypothetical, but that usually tends to be the case when it comes to technology that doesn't yet have much coverage to the people. If we were to get closer to the reality of driverless cars being commonplace among the public, then I'm sure we could come up with more solid arguments. However, until that day, we'll just have to sit tight and wait for our questionable autoobile future. ","Dear Principal, The student body is very upset with the change in the grading policy they just don't like the idea that if they don't having a B or higher in every class that they won't be able to participate in after school activities such as sports or student council. I understand what the school is trying to do by making students try to achieve a higher standard in grades, but this punishment for not having excellence in the grade books is totally out of line. For Example, some students my try their absolute hardest in the class but yet they don't make the best grades and you want to take away their spot on football team or spot on the student council for making an effort in school. I would like you to put yourself in our schools and see if this is unfair or not. Some of the students only way to express yourself is through the after school activities and you want to take that away from them because they didn't do well in English or another class. I work my best in school and see that a lot of the kids here do the same, but I ask you to consider maybe have the grade policy lower so that more people can have a chance to work and play in after school activities. I just ask on behalf of the student body to reconsider the grading policy to be lower so more kids have a chance to play sports or have fun in after school activities. Sincerely yours, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Senator, The Presidential Election is one of the most important events that goes on in the United States. At the core of this election is the Electoral College. The only problem is, the college has many flaws. Like in Source 1, it states that our Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election by a popular vote from the citizens who qualify. As you know the E.C consists of the selection of electors, meeting of electors where they vote for the President and Vice, and the counting of the votes by Congress. There are 538 electors, 538 votes, and it takes a majority of 270 votes to win the election. This flawed system has been around too long and it needs to be altered. I am in favor of getting rid of the E.C and going to winner by a popular vote. If the Presidential candidate is favored by more than 50% of the country then he or she should win. Like in Source 2 history shows that in the past candidates have clearly won the popular vote, but sill lost the presidency race. The problem with the current system we have in place is that the people who are supposed to have a direct voice in the government do not. Instead the people vote for other people who they are supposed to trust vote in favor of their opinion. I can see how some people believe in this system of trust, however some history has shown us otherwise. History has shown that electors can go against the opinion of the public. When you vote for electors most of the time they in turn vote for what the people want. The only thing is you are not ensured that this will occur. In the end it is up to the elector who can decide however they wish. Personally for the U.S. it would be more effective to go to winner by popular vote, not only because of the unsureness of the electors, but also because that is what the people want. Another valid arguement to get rid of the whole Electoral College process is in Source 2, it states that sometimes voters get confused with the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. That could be detrimental to the country if the wrong person for the job was elected. If it was the popular vote sytem the selection of candidates would be clear and easy to understand, which leads to less mistakes when voting. The view of getting rid of the Electoral College is actually quite popular. In Source 2 it tells us Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and others have all agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College. Going all the way back to the beginning of our country we started off on the base priciple that the people must have a direct voice in the government. That is the reason our country was made a democracy. The Electoral College has bent those principles and hasn't fully allowed the voice of the people to be heard. With the popular vote put in place their are no middle men, it is just the people voicing what they want and who they want to represent them. Looking over the information that has been presented it is clear that the Electoral College has to go. The system is flawed for many reasons such as the popular candidate not winning, voices not being ensured that they will be heard, and the confusing system of not voting directly for your President. If the change of winner by popular vote in the election is made none of the previous flaws will be present. The popular vote sytem will ensure the people get what they want and the process is completely fair. For these reasons it is in our society's best interest that our government makes this change. Abolish the Electoral College and bring on a new age of simple and fair elections! From, A concerned citizen.                                            ","Facial Action Coding Sytems: Good or Bad? People have bad days at school, whether it is from a home sitaution or just a bad grade. Being upset in school can affect your ability to preform well. This is why it is important for schools to have a Facial Action Coding System. One reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Systems in schools is because it would help recongnize when the students emotion is low, faster so it would not affect their grade. For example, in the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson."" This proves that if the student can become more engaged then they will do better in school. Another reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Sytems in schools is because it can give more insight into the student's home life. For example, if the student is having family problems you would be able to read it on their face with the coding system more quickly than through a human's eyes. Being sad could affect a student's scores and plummet their grade. Finally, it would be smart and affective to have a Facial Action Coding System in the schools becuase it involves intense algorithims that kids could try and solve and maybe build one themselves. The system would promote science, technology, engineerng and math, which is very important. In the passage it talks about the types of algorithims Dr. Huang uses, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical inforamtion as electronic code."" The coding Dr. Huang uses can be taught to students in order to further techonlogy in the world. However, having a Facial Action Coding System could be a bad idea because it would not give student's the kind of action and discpline they would have with a human teacher. It is important for student's to build a bond with a teacher and to be able to open up to them. In the case with a Facial Action Coding System in the classroom the student's would not be able to have that bond. In conclusion, it would be very benificial for Facial Action Coding Systems to be put in schools. They could help improve grades and give a better insight into problems a student may possibly be going through. It is very important to be able to read a student's emotion to help them academically. Everybody should push for Facial Action Coding Sytems to be installed in schools.","Sometimes, you can be wrong. Most of the time people recognize it, so you go to other people for advice. Seeking multiple opinions is a good idea because you get more input, you can combine ideas to make one super plan, and if someone knows something you don't, then you can correct your idea and make it better. One reason getting different opinions is a good idea is because you can get multiple second opinions. The best that could happen is that you and whoever you are talking with can add so many good opinions to your ideas that you could do something great with it, like design a great video game, or develop a new medicine, or maybe make a way to keep our soldiers safe in combat. If nobody gives any good opinions, you might just get laughed at. Not a lot of bad could come out of it. Another reason second opinions are a good idea is because you can combine them into one super plan. Lets say you were playing a strategy video game called Total War-Three Kingdoms. You might want to do just a frontal assault on the castle walls, and take them by force, but your friend might point out that they have heavy Pole arms up on the wall, a great anti-infantry unit. Your other friend says you need to take down the arrow towers along the wall to stop the enemy from peppering your troops with arrows as you assault the walls, and also need to use T rebuchets to destroy them. Then, you combine all the plans into one massive one- use the Trebuchets to both destroy the arrow towers and destroy the walls, taking out chunks of the wall so your troops can breach into the fortress, knocking the Pole arms off the wall (effectively killing them), and taking out the arrow towers. Now that's good teamwork. The final reason second opinions are better than only your own is if somebody knows information that you don't, they can provide it and you can revise whatever your idea or plan is. Say you are playing the same game (Total War-Three Kindoms), and this time you are defending on an open plane. You are maneuvering your troops into a defensive position that will be great for deflecting frontal attacks, when your ally tells you that they saw that the other team has a unit of the Black Mountain Marauders (a very good anti-infantry duel-ax wielding unit with the special ability to be able to be deployed behind the enemy), but you and your ally notice that they aren't with the main enemy army. Your ally realizes that they must be hidden in the trees off to the left of your main army, and that if you hadn't realized it, they would have flanked your army and taken a massive toll. So, your ally decides that you hold off the main army, and he uses his archers and cavalry to rain hell on the hidden ax warriors so they don't destroy you. How fun and violent. So, second opinions are almost always better than one. Sure, you might know what you're doing, but ask trusted others what their take on the situation is. The reasons you do this is because more inputs produce better ideas, you can combine inputs into one super opinion, and others might know key information that you don't, so listen.",,,,,,,

Venus is considered to be one of the most Earth-like planets that is in our solar system and many scientists want to know more about this treturous planet. Venus has its downs even though the planet is always being looked at for exploration, the conditions can not be survived by humans, but even so NASA is still working on different solutions to get there. The ""Evening Star"", Venus, in our solar system is the brightest star in the Earth's sky bringing curosity to many of the scientists working at NASA. These people want to explore Venus and all it has to offer but there are some drawbacks. The passage talks about how every past mission, unmanned, sent to Venus has failed and no spacecraft has survived for more than a few hours in this toxic environment. Not to mention the not a single spacecraft has touched down on the surface of Venus in almost three decades. The planet Venus might at one time have been the closest planet to Earths conditions known to man, and from what scientists do know Venus has rocky sediment which shows signs of valleys, mountains, and craters. Although scientists continue to have an interest in this dangerous planet there are some key factors of how this planet can not be explored. Venus has an environment that humans can not live on because of how extreme the conditions are. The atmoshpere on Venus is about 97 percent carbon dioxide which is not compatible with human life as well as the clouds that are made of corrosive sulfuric acid. This combination makes it almost impossible for light to enter the planet. The average temperature on the ground of Venus it around 800 degrees on any given day, which is almost 10x hotter than the warmest places on Earth. This is the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system. These conditions on the ground of Venus are even more dangerous than any submarine going into the deepest part of the ocean, so hot that most metals would liquify. It is hard to even conjuor how NASA is even going to begin to think of an idea as to how to get some type of spacecraft up to Venus. Even though the conditions are deadly to humans NASA is still working on ideas of how to study Venus, and they have some ideas. Scientists have studied simple electronics made of silicon carbide to help with preventing the heat from damaging the expensive technology within, but with testing the spacecraft would only last about a week on the surface of the planet. Another theory originates with technology used in World War ll and has computors that aren't as technologically advanced but can still produce viable information. These computors are made up of gears and levers in order to write up important information. The strong metals in the older computers are proven to hold up better against harsher weather conditions over the tin mostly used on newer forms of electronics. The latest theory, and the one that may just work, is to create a flying mode of transportation in order to keep the technology from touching Venus's hot surface. Putting the craft up into the air about thrity miles makes the conditions almost the same as if they were on the Earths surface. These strong ideas of how scientists may study this hazordous shows how new and better ideas can develop in the future. Understanding different planets in our solar system may be able to help with how we take care of the one we currently live on. The exploration of Venus may become a true and not as daunting task with our scientists persistence in curiousity of the harsh planet. Being that Venus is at some points the closest planet to the Earth it is important for humans to understand what it has to offer, after all it is called Earths ""twin planet.""   ","The question of, ""should the development of these cars should continue or not"" is actually a pretty good question. The fact that this is fairly new and raises some questions like, ""will is be safe, will it be better to use than a regular car, and how far in development can this actually provide us with?"" We can really predict the futuce, but we can be able to know what might happen based on what we know right know. Google, and most likely other car maker company, are trying to make this driveless car a reality. But how will they go about doing this? First, it's good to mentioned that it is not yet completely driverless. It runs with sensors and cameras to see the area around it, along with GPS to guide it where ever you want to go. Comes with many other things that is ""to minic the skill of a human at the wheel"". Why is that important? That's important because that's what makes the car to be driverless. They have. Basic idea and model and it works perfectly fine. It mentioned, ""their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"" and they are still finishing the final product. More things are going to be added on to make sure it is 100% safe to be in. Is it better than a person? Well i think that it could become better than a human driver. Humans can crash into things all by accident, just because they went to fast or press the gas on fowards instead if backwards. Many things can happen on the driver's fault. Minus any accident outside of control, like a tree had fallen down on your car, the driverless in theory could serve as a way to decrease crashes or accidents. If it works the way it should, the mostion sensors and cameras could detect things and hit the brakes before anything happens. Although it isn't completely driverless, meaning it mentioned in the article, ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but are desIgned to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" and even if it isn't yet completely driver less, when the designers and creators finnally make it for there is not need for human assistants, the car could theoretically be safer than a human driver. Did you accidentally ran your car to someone else's? The driverless car sure didn't. Did you fall into a hole you didn't see? The driverless saw that from GPS and sensors p and avoided it already. Just things that can enhance the car to make it safer to be holding a baby or really elderly person in. Why is this good for us? Well, imagine that the world is now use to this ""driverless car"" and is safest thing because of it's enhancers. People could hop in one and go anywhere knowing that they will be safe and arrive safetly. It is just more convinant to have, when being on auto-poilet, you can do anything you wish like calling someone when needed to, play games on a screen that could be provided, any more entertainting things that destract you with the boring, yet safe, ride. It it mentioned ""some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and infirmation systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" The idea of having a driverless car is actually a great idea once you think about it. With many upgrades and remodels, the car can and will be safe to use. It can be better than a normal human driver, and the options and things it can do to give us during the ride is a lot more than a person driving himself. This car will be the best thing that could happen to the roads and transportation.","Dear Principal, You said that the students couldn't participate in sports unless they have a B average, I would just like to say that that's a bad idea because students have so much homework and other stuff they have to do outside of school. That with sports and keeping a B average, that's a lot of work for one person. And on top of that the sports practise after school then school projects. Students will not have time to keep a B average because all the work they have to do. So for every kid and parent that wants to participate in sports, please change this school policy back, it would be a lot easier to the parents to because they work and have to clean all the time they don't have time to do all that. So please change the school policy back to having a C average or you wont have that much people on the sports teams, it would be a lot less stressful to everybody if you just changed it back. And if you want kids to play sports and represent the school. Thank you for your time to read this letter, i hope that you change your mind. Sincerely: Your Student STUDENT_NAME","Dear Senator, recently there has been much debate about whether the Electoral College should be retained or not. After reading the artices, it is very clear to me that the Electoral College has worked efficiently for many years and, therefore, should be kept as a way of voting for our country's president. First of all, even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral college is quite possible, it is much less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Imagine if an argument broke out about the outcome of popular voting. There would be absolute chaos and too many different opinions. Even though many voters would argue that they prefer direct voting, the product of that would only overcomplicate the system and make things run less smoothly. Secondly, the Electoral College should be kept because it restores the weight in the political balance that the bigger states lose by the virtues of the mal-apportionment of the Senate that was decreed in the supreme law of our country, the constitution. It also makes a tie highly unlikely. Lastly, the system of the Electoral College helps to avoid the problem of run-off elections. There is a lot of pressure for elections in which no candidate gets a majority of the votes cast. If it were not for the Electoral College, that pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College reduces the risk of a run-off election and produces an obvious winner. According to article three, since almost all states award the  electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis, even the smallest plurality in a single state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for tht party's nominee, and that trust is hardly ever betrayed. Some people argue that the Electoral College is unfair because because it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote may not win the national popular vote. Although that is true and it is possible, it is also incredibly rare. It happened once in 2000 in the election betweeen Bush and Gore, but that was the first time since 1888. All in all, I believe the Electoral College has proven to be consistently successful in the history of our country. After all, it has given us great presidents and, hopefully, it will continue to do so in the future elections to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ","The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. But is this advcanced system valuable or particularly necessary? In my opinion, although this coding system is brilliant, there is not a need for it in the classroom. The fact that I live in a time where computers could calculate my mood and or my emotions is nothing short of amazing. But, this coding system doesnt benefit the consumer at all. In paragraph six, D'Alto gives an example of a computer analyzing your mood as you come across an ad. So, if you come across happy or smiling the computer will continue to display like minded ads but, if your computer sees that you are frowing upon seeing the ad it will direct you to different ads. Now this is great for the compant who sells whatever is in the ad, they get to literally profit by this technology. But what does it do for the one viewing ads? Nothing. Another example given in paragaph six is in a classroom setting. Dr. Haing states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". I'm not saying that this technology cannot do what it claims but what it does is utterly uneeded in a classroom setting. If a student is becoming confused about a certain topic they should raise their hand and ask a teacher (even online run courses always ave a teacher there to supervise). They should seek out a teacher guidance because, at least in my school district. cirriculum cannot be altered. My district is made up of is five different highschools. All five teach the same exact math, english, and science curriculum. So, the computer would not even be permitted to change my lesson even if I was confused. So whats so helpful about a notification appearing on my screen saying thay I am about 63% confused? the answer is simply, its not. In conclusion, although this software sounds very talented in what it is capable of achieving, is not useful in the classroom. This specific technology would quite honeslty serve me and my fellow classmates no use at all. What this software can do is what almost any human can achieve with sight and cognitive skills. Give me valuable software that will give me alternate youtube videos or websites to hellp me if im confused not software that just tells me im confused. ","It was a normal day at the lunchroom when I noticed a new girl standing in the lunch line. She started to walk to the empty lunch table where she sat by herself, because no one invited her to their table.""She smelled funky and looked funky too"" I thought to myself. I turned to my left to tell Generic_Name about the girl. I quietly whispered in her ear,""Do you see that new girl over there?"" She looked behind her back and gave her this nasty look. ""Should we go talk to her?"" I asked. ""No! she's not like us"" Generic_Name exclaimed. I listened to Generic_Name and never got the chance to talk to her, and now she's one of the most popular girls in the school. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best. The first reason for seeking multiple opinions is because you see from a different point of view rather than just one person. When I'm having a problem with something I always ask multiple people and see what they think I should do. For example when you go to the Ice cream shop and you always get Chocolate but you got bored from it. You ask your sister on whether you should try a different one this time and she tells you,""No, it's probably going to taste bad."" You end up getting Chocolate and it just doesn't taste good anymore. You regret not asking your parents. And you lost a chance of trying something different because just one person thinks it's not a good idea. Another reason for seeking multiple opinions is to hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved. For example you are going dress shopping for Prom. You pick out a couple of dresses and try them on. You pick out your top two and ask your friends which one they prefer. Some picked the Red one and some picked the Purple one. You're torn on which one to get, but hearing other people's opinions helped you pick. Finally you decide to get the Red one because it was picked the most. Just listening to what other people have to say and the things they point out that you didn't notice help you make a better choice. The final reason for seeking multiple opinions is that it makes you think twice about which advice suits you best. For example I'm in the store at the Smithsonian Zoo and I can pick one bracelet. The first bracelet has my favorite animal on it but it's not cool, and the second doesn't have my favorite animal on it but it's cool. It's a tough choice to make but you always have to think of what suits me best not what suits the other people best. I shouldn't just buy the first bracelet just because everyone thinks it's cool. If I like the other one better then I should stick with that. It was a beautiful day during summer. I woke up feeling the warmth of the sun against my skin. I slowly got out of bed and went to brush my teeth and get dressed up. I had two choices to make. So I asked my parents and my sister if I Should wear noodle straps with jeans or a dress. Majority picked noodle straps with jeans, and so did I. It was a great choice because it was really hot outside. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.   ",,,,,,,
286,109,"The Electoral College consists of 528 electors. in order for the popular vote tobe valid, an Electoral Colege should continue as is. The Electoral College is a wide range of people who  know what it is thta they want. The Disrrict of Columbia is even considered to be a state just for the Electoral College purpose. The people of America choose their electors in which when they choose their Presidential candidate, they are choosing it's electors. The people of America are practically setting themselves up for whatever outcome comes into play. Some people claim that people are not voting for the president, but are voting for the slate of electors. These people, however, are simply dramatic and have no sense as to what is actually going on in their country. People do no tvote for a president just because of his or her electors. Presidents are elected because they, as a candidate to be a president, have somehow persuaded the majority of the country to vote for them on their own behalf. A good president is elected because he or she is a good president, not because he or she has good candidates behind them. Yes, with a president comes his or her electors, but the electors are not the ones running for president, therefore they are not the ones persuading the people of America to vote for them, for it is the president that is doing the persuading, and the president that is receiving the votes. The Electoral College has worked for many many years in the past and if held with respect will continue to work an be a successful way and form of voting. The outcomes will be valid and the responses will be accurate with reasonableactions following it. The disaster factor is a claim that goes against the Electoral College, however it is not worthy of being a factor. A tie in the Electoral College is not likely, and if it were to happen, it could easily be resolved.    ","Who knew that a planet referred to as Earth's ""twin"" could possibly provide so many unknowns to humans? Venus is the second planet in our solar system and is the ""closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". Venus has a more harsh environment than Earth. With a surface temperature of over 800 degrees, and a thick atmosphere of nearly 97 percent carbon, Venus is not tolerable for humans. Despite these presented dangers, the author of the article suggests that studying Venus is worth the risks. The author of the article mentions clearly in paragraph three the intolerable living conditions of the planet Venus. Although the author has knowledge of these dangers, they claim that studying the Earth-like planet is worth it. In order to back up their claim, the author provides facts in the texts to convince the reader of the following: ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This excerpt for example, may cause the reader to make inferences about other similarities between Earth and Venus, and would spark more interest in learning about Venus. In addition to similar physical features, the author mentions how Venus is ""our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This is a very vital fact, and significantly backs up the authors claim. Many planets and stars are several hundred light years away, making space travel and new discoveries by humans difficult. The closeness of Venus would allow humans to visit Venus, if there was a safe way to get there. Leading off of the previous statement, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been formulating a solution to ""the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus... Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". This would allow scientist to get extremely close to the surface of Venus, yet not close enough to gather samples from the planet itself. The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author was able to effectively support the idea that studying Venus is worth the risk, as it is the nearest planet to visit, as well as the idea of a blimp-like vehicle allowing close access to the planet to make new scientific discoveries. Despite the dangerous temperatures, and atmosphere composed of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide, the author provided many examples as to why studying Venus is worth the risk to make new discoveries, and gather beneficial information about Earth's so- called ""twin"".      ","Would you wanttolive in a world where driving is now done by computers? I mean, wouldn't that just be sweet? Well, I'm going to let you on a little secret that I call the ""Three Part Series"". This world would be dangerous, promote laziness, and would be quite expensive. Firstly, this invention would be dangerous. Not only would these computers have to be programmed to completely analyze and control the road, but new laws will have to be published for these driverless cars. In paragraph 9, it says ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" which over all make you stop and think. If this tecnology fails or makes a mistake, who is at fault, you the driver or the manufacturer? Will driving tests still be required in case of an emergency or will everyone lack the knowledge of driving? It's so dangerous that California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia has started to limit the use ofsemi-autonomous cars. Secondly, this invention will not only promote laziness but bring about other inventions that will promote computer controlled programs. These cars will provide a better respose and control than a human, like it says in paragraph 5, so will this push us to be less aware of the roads and dangers of accidents? You might say ""what's so bad about that?"", well not only are you losing your everyday self-awareness but you're allowing yourself to become lazy. No longer will your attention be on the road but instead focused on the lastest updated picture of Justin Bieber, while you drink a sweet tea from the dollar menu. Sooner or later you'll be the girl/boy everyone has seen give their clothes to a robot to wash them or your kitchen to a robot who cooks for you. Lastly, not only will you be lazy, but, you'll be broke too. In 2000, ""Radar"" or these driverless cars we're estimated to cost 200 million dollars. I don't know about you, but I know there's no way I'll be spending 200 million on driverless car when that's all I'm estimated to make for a LIFETIME. With the price of this car, I can imagine how much money these companies will be needing just to manufacturer one set each of these cars. So, just take a minute and think how money these companies are going to blow that can be used towards something else, like charity,at-risk neighborhoods, homeless shelters or even just rehab centers. So, ultimately you'll be spending more on this car then you'll make in a lifetime or even spend in a lifetime. In conclusion, I would like to say that I still agree and stand by my ""Three Part Series"" or TPS for short. As you can see, not only will this car be inefficient but it will be expensive, dangerous, and will promote laziness. So the next time you might think this will be a great idea, remember the engraved ""Three Part Series"".","In the article Luke was asked by his freind don to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so when he said yes that would change his life. So then now he has been on nine trips since the first ever trip that he has taken. Luke was always busy tending the cattle during the day. He was having lots of fun even when he got knocked over the boat and broken his ribs. He was playing board games and everything like that to keep him busy while he was healing. The reason of Luke going on trips across the oceans because he likes it and he was born to do it. Also his freind asked Luke to come with him to keep him company during the trips. Luke was waiting for some thing to drastically change his life and he to his wish off the drastic change. Luke would stop going with don if Luke didn't like the motion sickness,or because there where a lot of storms,or he didn't like tending the cows during the long and tiring journey. If the possibility was that Luke didn't like the sea his freind would be like are you ok and or something like that. In conclusion Luke loves the sea and he wants to keep going out and adventuring the wild and the unknown. Luke couldn't say no because it was his freind don and he wanted to explore another island. Luke loves the same because he likes tending the cows and he likes his fellow crew mates that are with him on his journeys to the out and the open sea. Another reason that is because he wants to be in dangerous storms and worlpools. Luke want to take the risks in the dangerous sea.","In 1976 the face was founf by NASA. the face was casued by a natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 was going around a planet and capturing pictues for a future place to land if they were to go to that planet, as they were going around they spotted a mark they sooned named it the Face on Mars, it reached nearly two miles from end to end it looked as if it was staring up at the ship. Scientits at fist thought it was just a shadow that looked liked a Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA soon let the pictures go public for all to see. Many people thought it was just giving an illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth. It ingaged the public and attracted attention to Mars. On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor went over Cydonia for the very first time. Michael Malin and his MOC team took a photograh that was ten times sharper than the first Vikings photos. On April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for another look. Some people say it was created by aliens, but the people at NASA say it was just created by a natural landform. There have been other spots found similar to the one on Mars, found in the America West. It has reminded some of the people at NASA of the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idho. Which is a lava dome that has formed mesa which is about as tall as the Face on Mars.","Many places all over the world are starting to become ""car-free"". This can have a lot of advantages. Air quality will improve, people will save money, and people will have less stress. A major advantage of reducing the amount of people driving is that the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted from those cars will be reduced. In paragraph 5 of Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it is stated that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars, with an even greater percent in large cities. If these cities were to stop using cars, the smog surrounding the cities would be able to clear within about a week. If all of the major cities in Europe would limit the use of cars, then the air would be much cleaner. In Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , the article talks about how cities in Columbia have had a car-free day for three years in a row. The goal of this day is to reduce the levels of smog throughout the country. It is also to try to get other countries around the world to have a similar day. If every country were to participate, the overall air quality would be able to improve drastically. Another advantage of becoming car-free is shown in Source 4: The End of Car Culture , where it describes that ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer liscenses as each year goes by."" The article also says that in 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked and has gradually lowered since. With less cars being bought, people are saving lots of money they would be spending on repairs, gas, tires, and other things that attribute to the price of a car. Not having to worry about whether or not their car will start when they have to go to work will be able to lower a person's stress. As less people drive from place to place, they will begin to walk or ride a bike to get where they need to go. Many people believe that excercise can also reduce stress which can make people happier and more willing to help others. Whether it's improving air quality, saving people money, or lowering stress, becoming car-free has many advantages. As less people use cars, more good effects will begin to show.    ","The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college. Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest. concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they don't put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers. according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes. concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ",,,,,,,
286,235,"""When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shouldn't be the way candidates win. The election should change, the candidates should earn their votes, win by popular vote. If the process of voting changes to ""win by popular votes"" then at least the candidate would win fairly. If you think about it, wouldn't you want to win fair and square? don't you think you should earn your votes? or in general, if you think people should earn their votes then you should get an understanding of what is trying to be explained here. I'm not the only one that thinks that the election should be by popular vote; ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" plenty of other people think we should vote directly instead of having the Electoral College system. Nobody wants to vote for other people other than the one running for President, well at least 60 percent of the people don't. The electoral college is unfair and it is why I think the election should count by popular vote. The electoral college is unfair because sometimes candidates don't a have chance to visit states so it's difficult to gain votes from those states the people who vote aren't really voting, it's the electors who are a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does (basically what I meant in reason 1) The point here is, I think we should get rid of the Electoral College since it has been proven that it is unfair and just have a fair voting system from now on. Maybe put on a debate to see what people would prefer.                                     ","Venus is the planet with the most similarities to our planet Earth. Venus is most definitely something worth exploring it is similar to our planet earth, it is dangerous, and it is just fascinating to explore different places. Venus is very much alike our planet earth Astronomers think that long ago Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported life. Venus also has many planet like structures for example valleys, mountains, craters, and much more. In pragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today... The planet has a surface of rocky sedimemt and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" That shows how Earth and Venus are so much alike. Even though Venus is so much alike Earth it is way more dangerous. For example Venus temperature is way hotter than our temperature becaus it is closer to the sun and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. I know that Planet Venus is a dangerous planet because in paragraph 3 it says ""A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosohere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaterthan what we experience on our own planet"" This proves that the conditions on Planet Venus is far to dangerous for us humans to be able to withstand. With that being said Astronomers and scientists still believe it is worth exploring Venus because it is such a fasncinating planet. Astronomers still want to explore this planet more because it is the planet that is the closet to being just like our planet Earth with the most similarities than any other planet in our whole solar system. I know this because on Paragraph 4 it talks about the similarities between venus and earth, it also says that the astronomers are fascinated with Venus. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" that shows that Astronomers think it's worth exploring. Planet Venus is mos definitely a very fascinating planet, is very similar to our planet Earth, and also very dnagerous for us humans. But is it worth exploring?","I am against the development of these cars because I do not think everyone should have them. These cars could be a great idea, but there are some things that could turn this good thing into a bad thing. There are people out there that mess these types of things up, there are safety concerns, and I just think this is unnecessary for some people. There are a few reasons on how humans could turn this good idea bad. There are people that do drugs and alcohol and drive afterwards. These are the type of people that would mess this technology up. In the article it says how the BMW would need human control over the car sometimes and if there is a driver that is drunk, they cannot do a good job of control. I think there would be a lot more crashes with this. People could also fall asleep or get very distracted while sitting there waiting for their turn to drive. One safety concern I have about this technology is what would happen if the robot car messed up. Technology is not perfect and has major issues. Although these cars would have some safety features, it can always mess up. The in-car system that has entertainment for the driver is also a distraction. Things happen in split seconds and this kind of system would leave the driver distrated and unaware of the things going on around them. This technology is also unreasonable to me because the only reason i think someone should have this type of technology is if they are handicap and cannot drive. People that can drive should drive on their own, I see no point to having a computer driven car. It is something that is not needed and extremely lazy. I do not think anyomne needs a car to drive them around if they can do so themselves. Overall I think this is a bad idea. There would be too many issues and people would take advantage of this. I think the more advanced you try to get in technology, the worse things will get because people can not handle themselves.","Hi my name is Luck Bomberger and as you may know i have crossed the Altantic Ocean 16 time. Why? You might ask because i wanted to help people recover from War World ll. And i could also trave the world. While helping so many people i was able to see Europe and China. While in Italy I took a ride in a Venice, Italy a city with streets of watere. It was amazing not only did i see amazing places but I was able to work with a lot of amazing animals. It took to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the east coast of the United States and a mouth to get to China. But carry for the aniamls took a lot of work. I had to feed them and clean up there mess. But working in my Aunt Katie's farm when i was younger helped me a lot. We also had a lot of fun off the boat to. When we let the aniamls of the ship we woiuld us the empty holds to play games like Vollyball and Baseball. but i have also got hurt in the ship where i have broke my rips.

See over hundreds and thousads of years land is formed and thats all this face is, a landform. Many people are on your side about the exstings of aliens which many people beleive in but the only reason most people beleive in ailens are because there are so many movies and television shows on aliens it seems real. There are so many land forms that look unusal that are here on earth, but you can't say aliens made them, we except the fact that it's a land form and not that some unknown creatrue did it. There can be a thousand people saying aliens made the face but no one is going to belive them if they have absoluty no proof at all.

The first source talks about a city that is in Germany called Vauban, where residents have accepted the challenge of no car usage. The city is designed for walking to department stores, grocery stores, ect. But this so what utopia is not all a utopia itself, where 30 percent of families own cars. Also the United States Enviornmental Proctection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities like Vauban. This action to have a car reduced communites was because of the damage done by cars on the enviornment by pollution. The second and third source is about how a city took matter into their own hands and had a ""car free day"". In the cities of Paris and Columbia is where it took place. First the reasons why is because of near-record pollution of poulltion in the enviornment of Paris. Where on Columbia the reason for the car frre day was because they want to promote alternative transportation and smog. In Coulmbia this day has been going on three years straight! In the last source, it tells about how car culture is ending slowly. In the United States pople have been ""buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" A study shows that driving by young people has decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009. Finally, all these sources have explained that a non motorized vehicle is for the best in our health and in our enviornment. it is a new and innovatied way that is being accepted by a numerous amount of the population.    ","Education is a essential part in your life and also an opportunity to have your dream job in the future, is really important assist to school to have education, but there is a many reasons to be absent in school for example: for some people is difficult assist to class cause maybe they missed the scholar bus and they did not have a transportation or they could have a part time job that worn out them to be ready for the next day of school and also the weather can be in extremely bad conditions and it is dangerous be outside so you can stay aware at home. Nevertheless, however there is also a many options for do not miss the content of the classes of the school cause you can attend classes from home by video conferencing or online, that is a good benefit for you cause you can stay in home and at the same time be able to keep on track your study, but also has a disadvantage cause not everyone has a internet connection at home and that make kinda impossible attend classes from home and also you can get confused with a topic and you have questions and your teacher could not be able in that precise moment to solve your questions then you will have to wait until the teacher could be available again. There is more disadvantages for example: you cannot enjoyed the activities that school organized or field trips that school planned, you could not spend some time with friends and also with your teachers and you could not contribute with school activities and be in clubs or sports team of the school. Those are activities that students were attend classes online from home maybe could not be able to get done. Above all the disadvantage of attent classes at home there is the same benefits that go to regular school offer to you but with a different method of learning. In conclusion, there is many ways to continue school even if you stay at home through a online site, of course there will be disadvantages but you always can see the benefit of that and you have to make more effort than normal to learn new things. I think distance learning is a good choice cause has almost the same benefits that go to school, but instead you staying at home",,,,,,,
286,494,"Florida State Senator, The Electoral College is a crucial part of the United States's election process. There are some negatives to the Electoral College but the positives outweigh them by a landslide. The certainty of the outcome and having a president that the majority likes are key beneficial factors to the Electoral College process that would be lost if we changed the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. With the Electoral College, there is a very rare chance that there would be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. However, according to In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible--it happened in 2000--but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" A clear winner will always be produced with the slight innormality of a tie. In 2012's election, Barack Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote compared to the 61.7% of the electoral vote. If the election process was by popular vote, it would have been a much closer race between Obama and Romney. To win the Electoral College vote, each region must like you. You cannot have a presidential candidate that favors one region and only one region favors that candidate. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner states, ""...a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" In contrast, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer claims that even ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register says, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President."" Because of the number of electoral votes each state has is based on population, meaning Texas has more votes than Rhode Island, every presidential candidate focuses on winning over the big states. The big states are a better representation of our nation's opinion. The Electoral College process should not be replaced by the popular vote due to the extremely rare chance of a tie. It should remain because an outcome is certain and majority of the population would like the president.

In paragragh 3 it says ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" meaning that Venus isnt the only thing that is challenging also meaning that, clouds highly corrosive are more challenging to learn or even study about. Venus is the secound planet from our sun, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely its often referred to as Earth's twin. In paragragh 4 it says "" venus was probably covered largely with oceans"", so maybe we didnt even realize we had it because it was covered by oceans or maybe it just didnt wan to be seen. The author says in paragragh 8 that "" Venus has vaule , not only becasue of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".","Driverless cars are coming! Google have these driverless cars. Companies are making these, ""driverless"" cars. These driverless cars are not actually...well, driverless. Electrical cars are coming, and you won't want to miss it. Television and movies have developed a theory of these cars. The theory is how the car may look and also, drive. Google has had cars that could drive independently under certain circumstances since 2009. Google cars have driven over half a million miles without a crash. google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor. Companies are already, and have already, been making these computer driven cars. As an example, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Google made the modified Toyota Prius, and BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. These, ""driverless"" cars are not really driverless. Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless carb to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. The Google Cars must have an alert driver when driving. The Google Car cannot pull in and out of driveways. When dealing with road contrustion or navigating through an accident, the driver must take over then as well. The BMW, ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" can reach speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Driverless cars are in the making. Google has already made a few cars that are some what driverless. Companies are on the uprising of completeing their first driverless car. The cars they're making out to seem driverless are not actually driverless, but they're in the making. The technology is close enough. Electrical cars are coming, and you won't want to miss it.","Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a good thing to be in. They help countries in need and can save peoples lives.

Luke and Ron helped out countries that were destroyed by World War Two. They did that by dilivering animals to the destroyed places. If they didn't do that a lot of people might have died. Thats why peaple should join. They could have a chance to become heros and save lives in countries in need. Also peole can have the advantage to see cool sights. Luke and Ron went to Acropolises in Greece, and went to a castle in Crete. They also looked at the Panama Canal on their way to China. Becoming a Sea Cowboy gives you the chance to go around the world. Being a Sea Cowbay isn't a dangarous job either. Luke only endered one injury on the job from what the story said. There's also a chance to have fun on board. When Luke went on return trips all the animals were unloaded. The crew was able to play games like table tennis, fencing, and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than going on an adventure. It opens up the world for people who have never been to a lot of places. Luke was very gratefull for the opportunity to be a Sea Cowboy. It makes people more aware of the things that need to be stopped in the world. The awarness stays with you to. Luke went on to host a lot of international students and exchange visitors for the next coming years. After the last paragraphs it makes it pretty obvious to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It makes a lot of good becoming one also. There is also new experiences to be made to. So if there's nothing working out for you maybe becoming a Seagoing Cowboy will fit yourself and give you a chance.","If I was a scientist on Mars with somone who thought the face was formed by aliens, I think I would disagree. I would disagree because aliens are not real and why would they just made a radom face into the ground. I would say that the land in that area is just deformed. I think that it is just Mother Nature, she put it like that, that spot is a natural landform. People might think that aiens are real but that saying is just a myth that some people that are nerds will belive. I use to think they were real and then I figured out they weren't. If they was real then when people or NASA went to a planet or just into space, why didn't those people every see them? If they did exist why wouldn't people take pictures when they were in space of the aliens? Why don't aliens exist? If aliens do exist do you think they would attack you if they saw you? I would think that aliens would be on earth. What would aliens be like if they were on earth? would the Earth still be the same if they was on Earth. Who would controll them if the did exist. Would aliens be in a zoo, becuse they are a weird like creture/human. people should know that akiens aren't real becuase if they were they would be on earth and people would take pictures and other things. Some could kill you other could hurt you or do other horrible things to you. That face on the ground was a natural landform it was not formed by aliens.  ","Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. Vauban's steets are entirely ""car-free"" - except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for $40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of Vauban's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."" - According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to the odd-numbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just five-days of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates the following day. Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this car-free day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, ""Day Without Cars."" 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a two-seat bicycle. Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally."" Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. ""I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bike-sharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being; safety, money, and pollution. If you had to choose between driving or public transportation to make the littlest difference in your community, what would you choose?                            ","Students every year are increasing from skipping school. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students should all have an option to learn from home. Some people can work better with online classes or videos. Students are sometimes not in the mood to go to school or see some other people at school, if so they could stay home and learn there with their classes. Some people can work better with online classes or videos. It can help kids if they dont really like there classes or if they are very independent. This is very neat and i think a lot of students would benefit off of it. Expertise now with this new technology some people like working on the laptops so they would like if they could sit at home and work on class. Students can also not worry about getting up early and getting dressed for school, they can just get up and get on there laptop and do there class work. Students arent happy to go to school all the time, but with this option they can do they classes online or watch videos about there classes. At home students can be conflictual and safer. The work at home can be nice they can take breaks and eat food whenever they want, therefore they would still have to work on there class work. however, student could always get distracted and not do there work. They can also choose just to take a day off at home so there should be a parent near to push them. Parents should be near the student while doing work so they can see what they are working on and help them if needed. So i think thats why we should have an option if students should have online classes at home or watch videos about there classes. either or is a good thing i like the idea. Some people still like going to school so that is fine too. Like i said early parents should be in on this and be there with there kids if they do choose to stay home.                                                           ",,,,,,,
286,563,"Me being a young teenager and only being in highschool, I feel as if we should keep the Electoral College. Reasons being, if we change too the election by popular vote, citizens are going too choose the president they like, the president that they think will change things, and the president that they think looks best. So of course the citizens are going too choose that particular president just so that president can get the most votes and become president. Changing too the most popular vote will not be the best idea because, citizens are going too choose the president that they like regardless if the president is good or not so good. If us citizens that are voting like the president, then chances are, we're going too vote for him or her. Not only are we going too vote for him or her, were also going to tell our friends too vote for them also so the president can get the most likes and get elected. With the Electoral College, the votes have to go through a process and then the election goes from there. Chances being with the most popular election is, we're going too get a not soo good president elected as our president. Most people think that if they choose the ""right"" president, then things are going too change when thats not true. People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say ""well, I only her/him for them because he/she looked as if he/she could change things."" Just because he/she LOOKS like they could change something, doesn't mean its going too happen. That's where the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes in. I've heard many people say ""I voted for such and such as president because he/she looks best."" In an election for president, looks do not matter what so ever. The president could be handsome or gorgeous and be the worst president in the United States and/or the president could be ugly and be the best president. In a president election, no one is going too care about the looks of the president. We're going too care about the person being voted for president, outlook on things as being the president. A lot comes with being a president and the looks surely aren't one of the things. In my personal opinion, if you're voting for the looks, then maybe you shouldnt be voting at all. There's many reasons on why we shouldnt change too the most popular vote election and why we should just stay with the Electoral College. The most popular vote election would not be the smartest idea of voting for president and honestly, in my opinion, I feel as if the Electoral College is best. Who would want a president being president because they got the most votes for being liked, voted because their the right president, or voted because they look the best? Truth be told, that's probably the worst thing too change too. With that being said, lets stick too the Electoral College.    ","In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" many challenges of studying Venus are presented; however, the author provides many valid reasons as to why researchers should find ways to study this planet. The author describes the similarities of Venus and Earth, provides solutions to living on Venus, and expresses how researching Venus would be an advancement of the human mind. The author supports their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit despite its dangers, by suggesting that Venus may have once been similar to Earth. The author wrote in paragraph 4, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" By suggesting that Venus could have some answers to Earth's climate, the author provides strong support to their claim. The text also states in paragraph 4, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author goes on to describe how Earth and Venus may have been closely related long ago. It is also mentioned that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit, which is beneficial considering the how long space travel takes. The author's claim is supported through this evidence of Venus being Earth-like at one point in time. Another way that the author suppprts their claim is by providing some solutions to studying Venus, despite the dangers it possesses. The author writes in paragraph 5, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" In paragraph 5, the author continues to explain how the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not go over the radiation levels on Earth. The solution that the author suggests helps support their claim of Venus being worthy of pursuit by giving direct evidence as to how researchers may go about doing this. Lastly, the author supports his/her claim by explaining how overcoming the challenge of studying Venus, would be beneficial not only to the insight of the planet, but also of human curiosity. The author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The claim is strongly supported through the author's description of how studying Venus could be beneficial to the human mind. Another detail from paragraph 8 is, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author supports that studying Venus would be worth overcoming the harsh conditions, as it would expand our views of imagination and innovation. Despite all of the author's reasons for studying Venus, he/she describes how Venus has harsh conditions that must be overcome first. The text states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The author expresses how Venus's conditions are far more extreme than any conditions on Earth. However, the author supports their claim by providing various reasons that support how Venus is worty of pursuit and how researchers may go about overcoming the dangers it possesses. In order to support his/her claim, the author was able to provide at least three strong reasons that show how Venus would be worth studying, even though it presents many dangers. By explaining how Venus may have once been comparable to Earth, providing solutions to current problems, and expressing the benefits of studying Venus, the author is able to strongly support his/her claim with valid evidence.            ","I believe that driverless cars should be developed. It may be true that some of the people and states go against driverless cars. But, people are making driverless cars improve everyday. With every new type of development there are going to be positives and negatives. The positives of the driverless car is that it can drive by it self. Also the driverless cars alerts the individual thats driving the car if he or she is in danger. The negatives about driverless cars is that it has lots of improvements to be made. For example,if the alert system didnt work while you was 15 seconds from a accident and the car was driving you in someone got hurt who would the police blame you or the manufacture. But, even with these error I still think driverless cars would be very helpfull. Some of the ways a driverless car could be helpful to a individual driver is on roadtrips. The reason why I said this is because road trips are very long. So even if you fall asleep while driving the car the car is doing ninety percent of the driving. So you should still be safe because the car is driving on its own. The only problem is that you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. But most people who fall asleep while driving always keep there hands on the wheel. So I dont think people keeping there hands on the wheel will be a problem. In conclusion I believe in the development of driverless cars because once the cars are fully developed I believe these cars will bring more positives than negatives. This is why I believe in the development of driverless cars.","One of the reasons is that there could be very sick poeple you go by and it might make you sick and sad to see that poeple are sick. Or it could be dead bodies floating in the ocean which might smell bad and make you sick to your stomach. Also feading farm life That will make you STINKY and smell bad. Also where does the ""waste"" goanyway do they throw it off the edge of the ship? or leave it there? I would not want to live there for two weeks it would be smelly nasty gross and disgusting. The ride would be long also I would be very homesick i would miss my family my friends and pets. Also what happens if you crash you you float out to see or get rescued or drown or live on to tell the tale? What would happen to the animals? would THEY drown or THEY float away or They survive or you could get eaten by sharks! Or get impaled by a storms debrie or get very very SICK! or even worse someone kills you. Now I wouldnt want to be on THAT boat. For my second to final papagraph I would 1 Not want to get sick. 2 I would not wanna get killed. 3 I would not want to get impaled by debrie. 5 I would not want to get eaten alive. 6 I would not want to see sick or dead poeple on my trip 7 I would not want to crash and get stranded 8 I would not like o drown 9 I would miss my family friends and pets. 10 I would not like to eat rotten or smelly food or drinks. What would happen if you have to eat the animals then no more food for the poeple who need it and it would be cruel and you cant drink plain ocean water it needs to be distilled and run out of water faster. And if you fall over board you could get left behind or get saved and live to tell the tale or get thrown overboard or get eaten by animals or if the animals die then they get thrown over board and it would be wierd and gross seing animals being pulled along by the current. So in conclusion I would not want to join the ""Sea Cowboys"" or any thing envolving the sea i get very seasick easily around oceananic trips around large oceans/or large lakes. I also have had abd experiences with lakes and even channels. So i know that i would not want to go out on a two week trip on a boat...over a ocean.....where i could die.",The thing they saw is just a natural landform. There is no evidence that someone could have made it. Its just the was people look at it making them think that its a face. Things occur and just move things and make them look different. they may also made different shapes and objects. there is no evidence that aliens could of done it. My opinion is that the way things move things could have crashed into it and made it look like a face. Its just something natural that happened. They don't have enough evidence to show what caused the face to form. Many things could have happened for the face to form but it doesn't mean that aliens or ancient things could of done this. NASA has been putting a lot of money into this to see what caused this thing to form. They think there is life on that planet and that is what caused it to form and something made that thing that looks like a face. They saw that there wasn't any alien movement that it ws just a natural land form and thats what is. No aliens could have done this face. The thing that they thought was a face was just a mesa. All of this was just that they thought aliens had done the face. but then they discovered that there was no alien movement and figured out that it was just a mesa. they were done with their research because they had nothing else to do with the mesa that they thought something had formed it.                                                                                                 ,"Ever since their invention, cars have been a very important part of the modern society. Everywhere you look there is someone driving to work, or shopping, or going to a doctor's appointment. These are all advantages to  having a car, but if you look closer you can see how these cars may be doing more harm than help. Air pollution is the problem most people see, however cars also keep people from face to face contact when you pass someone on the road, and you can't overlook the extravagant cost of having a car. These are the points of intrest for many scientists, sociologists, and general people all over the world. Air pollution, the bane of existance for every health and nature lover, is a massive problem that is getting way out of control. In an article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she explains that passenger  cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some parts of the United States! If you reduce the amount of cars on the roads, it would lower those numbers drastically. For example, in Paris, they banned certain cars from driving on certain days. The result was astonishing! Street congestion alone went down by seventy percent. While the pollution goes up, the amount of face to face contact of people goes down. Someone in a car could pass someone else on the highway without knowing that that was someone that they haven't seen in months or even years! Without cars the main way of transportation would be walking and/or biking. When walking and biking you have the ability to talk to people . That person you haven't seen in forever can see you and strike up a conversation. Someone who has had a bad morning can have the opportunity to let out some steam instead of  going to work angry and upset. Something you absolutely can't avoid about cars is the cost. Between the car's cost itself, the insurance every month, the cost of repairs, and the constantly rising gas prices, many people can barely afford it. Without all of those costs, most people could have more money for their home, groceries, education, and many other things. You can already see the improvements. In 2012, a study showed that driving by younger people decreased by twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009. Another study showed that there has been a large drop in the percentage of sixteen to thirty nine year olds  getting a license. These are the steps we need to take, this is the path to a better, healthier planet as well as the people on that planet.               ","Imagine being stuck at home all day and your mom being your teacher. How boring would that be right? Today we are going to take a side on if home school benefits more or if going to school does. Most schools give everyone this option to home school due to if the student can't make it to school for a reason. But they recommended going to school because it is a better way to learn. I feel like everyone learns and gets to experience more when you actually step out the house and go to school. However people who think online school is more benefical have their reasons. Such as being able to go at their own pace or simply how it is easy to reach. These all are some benefits that online school does have, but i believe that going to school gives you these benefits and way much more. Although some people believe online school is better, Actually going to school can benefit students more because you are able to interact with more people and can seek extra help. A big reason why going to school is better is that students get more of a experience. What does that mean? Well what i mean by that is students get to actually discover and learn more about what they are studying. For example if a student gets an option to study fahion at home or at a school in New York. It would be way much better to go study in New York because you are able to talk to industrys and other people who are into fahion as well. So if students go to school they would not online learn about the topics they are studying, but they would get speaking and other skills as well. Also another big reason is looking for extra help or learning more than what they know. If students do online school they would'nt be able to look for extra help if they get stuck on a unit. For example this one time i could'nt make it to school due to a sickness, so I attempted learning what i missed on my own, but I did not understand it till i went back to school and my teacher expained it to me. If students got stuck like me and could not go to a resource like a school to look for help. How would they learn? This is why i believe online school is not as benefical as they make it sound to be. So this is why going to school can benefit you way much more than online school. You dont get the benefits of interacting, experiencing and takling to other students. Overall online school will not benefit students in my opinion due to its lack of intercation with the outside world.",,,,,,,
286,923,"Dear Senator of Florida, Citizens and residents of the state of Florida, or ""Floridians"" may have an issue with the Electoral College vote. The majority of citizens and residents of this state may ask a request to change the Electoral College vote to popular vote. The reasons to why they're asking a request may be either because they're tired of it, find it unfair, or they want to try how successful the popular college vote can be when it comes to electing their president, although they don't know if their expectations might go wrong and it will be a complete chaos. Well, I personally believe that the Electoral College Vote should be kept in the state of Florida because it avoids run-off elections, and it has been practiced for the past 2 centuries and it seems it has been a success. To begin with, the Electoral College vote should be kept because it avoids run-off elections not only in the United States but especially here, in the state of Florida. This means that the Electoral College vote avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner Election"" it states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state... Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"". This quote indicates that the Electoral College vote equally distributes the states' votes to the corresponding candidate who's running for President and every amount of the state's vote counts. I understand that the Electoral College may be consider extremely unfair and useless to some citizens and residents here in the state of Florida because of its way of processing the votes and electing the President.                                    ","Exploring Venus is very dangerous considering the harsh conditions you would face when entering it's territory. The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents in this article. The author says the planet it much like Earth. ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" gives plenty reasons that could result in safe ways to explore this planet resulting in a big enough reason to further reasearching the planet. Venus is alike Earth in many ways. The author states that, ""...it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus had oceans, rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Researching this planet and getting information on this planet in very important because it will lead to many other things to explore in the future. If scientists are going to get hands on studying, there has to be a safe way to conduct a trip to the planet. There are many ways that NASA could get humans there safely. The author says a possible soulution would be getting a float to hover over Venus to observe the atmosphere and get photgraphs and videos. Because the extreme conditions of high heat an pressure have to be counted in on this, the float would make the conditions survivable. The author also adds that getting mechanical computers could also help in researching Venus. ""These decvices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" The device that the author is talking about could help because they are flexible to pressure, heat, and other forces that would be placed when on Venus. The author adding evidence that shows there could be ways to get around the conditions means that there is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers the planet presents. In paragraph 8, the text says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts bust should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author says that eventhough there are dangers, humankind should still fulfill their curiosity in this topic.    ","I think that driverless cars are a great idea. The computer will help with all the human error. Humans tend to cause a lot of problems on the road. There shpuld be a safety precaution incase the car can't manuver through a work zone or anthing harzordus. This driverless car will minimize accidents and speeding. These cars will help so much with human errors. The cars should have something for kids in it to keep them quite. So there would be no fussing while the parent is trying to relax. While the care is doing the work the parent she be able to sit back and enjoy the ride. In the passage the author said something about the car signaling when the driver needs to take control. There always should be someone who knows how to drive behind the wheel at all times. The car should know when there are harzardous threats apporching it. In conclusion, a driverless car would be a grat thing in this world. This car would minimize accidents and being pulled over. The car would be the first of its generation.","In World War 2, I was asked if I wanted to join thew UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. I believe that you and others should join because you maybe be helping your country and other countries. Also if you join it will help you in the long run by getting you special offers from other army groups and countries. If you could join would you, why or why not? I really think you should join because it is a really fun experince. I have multiple reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys of the UNRRA. One reason you should join is that you could sightseeing while you are picking up the animals from the country ar in or on the way to other countries. Another reason you should join this program is when you turn 18 you could join other military services and other projects like this one. The thrid reason is the you get work with animals such as young cows, mules ,and horses. Final reason is that when you ngo from country to counrty you will go relaxz and have fun with your mates and you could final read that book you been wanting to read. Those are my reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. After all of these reasons would you want join the program. I am telling you it will do you some good later on in your life and you will love going aroundthe wolrd and explore. Oh and did I forget to teel you that you have you do an hourly check on the animals and you get to feed them. After all The trips you will be very grateful for the experince and opportunity to go acroos the world. Lastly You can do so much fun stuff on board after you are return from trips by doing stuff like fencing, boxing, table-ennis matches. and ithers games and activies. JOIN THE SEAGOING COWBOYS PROGRAM!!!  ","Hve you ever been in an argument before? Well I am goingto try and persuade you that the face are a natural land form. First I will talk about the way I know that the face are not created by aliens or something. So lets get to it So now in the paragraph I am going to provide you with facts and details from the rticle of why I think it is a natural land form. First If this really is a face made by aliens or something where is the rest of the body? Also We as on earth NASA says that they have never seen or recorded a real life alien. If aliens did make this it would be in the news because come on how many aircrafts are sent into space a day most likly about one ever day. And we also have a satilite up in space and I bet you Countries like Russia, Canada, and probaly even the British have one up in space. And if something like that happened I would hope one of those satilites would see that happing. And for all you and me now is that are moon has craters in it. Right? So craters happen ever day so could something like this happen I would think so. And NASA also said that they did there reserach by pictures taken by the space shuttles and very accurte drawing of the ""Face"" not done by conserise theroys. In conclusion Those were some of my best argument reason of why I think the face is a natural land form not a face that was made by aleins. So thos eare my reasonings. So what do you think it is?","To the fellow citizens, the advantages of limiting car usage in the world could limit the numbers of miles driven, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and the parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city. To begin informing the fellow citizens more about the advantages, the numbers of miles can be limited. In the united states the numbers of miles driven peaked  and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by doug shorts of advisor perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- 39- year-old getting a licenses. Driven was found that young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. All according to source 4:The end of car culture. To continue the advantages, passenger cars are responisble for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissons in Europe. Beijing and china are well known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. In the suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes makes a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallyreduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, experts says. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emisson. Futher more the parks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city of Mockus, according to the citys mayor. the bicycle paths that is 118 miles has made parks and sports centers bloomed, smooth side walks, and rush-hour restriction have dramatically cut traffic which means less congestion. New restaurants and upscaled shooping districts have cropped up, which means the bicycle path made store good income    ","Imagine it, sitting at home in your pajamas getting ready to take a test for high school, and it sounds to good to be true. Many schools do offer programs like this so they can open up space in classes for other students. These programs have shown improvement in student mental health as well as scores. Students who take classes at home would benefit students because it would improve overall grades in certain classes, help students with more family responsibility get an education, and students don't need to worry about the stress of the classroom. Certain classes don't require as much guidance from the teacher as others, and that is just the reality of it. Classes such as math and sciences require students just to know how to work a problem, and that can be taught with a book or a video. So with more of the more technical classes being at home grades will improve because of the more time dedicated to learning a concept at home instead of a more limited time in the classroom. Also if you do have a question for the course at home technology today allows us to instantly communicate an issue to our teachers. Overall students in this environment can gain a lot out of working out problems at home. Some students have missed school some days or even dropout because of responsibilities at home. Online classes provides them means to be able to get an education and better improve their lives. This allows opportunities for higher education or even a shot at a job. Online classes give the time needed for students that have more responsibilities to learn key concepts in classes. These students have the work ethic to be great students,but lack the time to work on school. However because of online classes they can work and excel at it. The stress and anxiety of the classroom creates an setting that makes students not get the help required to learn the material, but with digital courses the more stressed students can learn the concepts. Students put pressure on other students to move along with a lesson especially when no other students are confused; this leaves some students behind in courses. Also for the few students that do fall behind are affect the whole year due to missing one key concept at the beginning of the year. This can be solved with online classrooms because it is a much more one on one learning experience, and allows students to grasp the main ideas. Students who suffer from stress and anxiety can have an equal opportunities as the more confident students. In conclusion,students overall who have difficulty due to time, mental health,and just plain boredom can have an equal shot at an education as other students. Online classes are the path to success for students that have to take care of younger siblings or work to support their families. Also they give students who don't need to much help in a class to have more flexibility in a class. Finally students who suffer from anxiety are given a chance to really learn a concept,and not fall behind their piers. The idea of an online classroom will be the future of the education system in not only Virginia, but The whole United States.",,,,,,,
899,109,"How do you use your cell phone the most? To text some or use the calculator? To call someone or check the date? A cell phone definitely comes in handy in some everyday situations, but is it necessary to use it in school when all of the tools that you need are handed to you? These are questions that most students don't really ask themselves. They complain about not being able to use their phone in school, but why do they need to use it? So does a cell phone immediately turn into a distraction as soon as it hits a school campus? Now, I'm as much of a kid as the next guy, and I use my cell phone probably just as much, but I've never needed it in a school situation unless I was just plain lazy. People say that they wouldn't use their cell phone to text in school, but to use it as a resource. Well, when a student sneaks and uses their cell phone in class, are they using it to solve the question in front of them or telling their friend how bored they are at the moment? My point exactly. Rarely is a cell phone taken out for a helpful use. Also, if cell phones are legalized in the school system, then how often would cell phones get used then? With out the danger and risk in using a cell phone, the students won't find much of a use for them then. Another argument might be that they need to call/text their mom to inform her of something that's extremely important. Well, if it's something of that nature of emergency, then that's why there is such thing as an office phone. If your sick, ask if you can go to the clinic, then the clinic will diagnose you, then give you the option to call your mom and ask anything that you may need to ask. Why permit cell phones when you have an already functional process at hand? Same goes with if you need something dropped off at the school. You can easily fill out a hall pass, walk whatever short distance it may be to the office, request to use the phone, and 99.9 times out of 99.9, they'll let you use it.","Dear Principle, Many schools take part in sports and after school activities for students pleasure and fun, but some schools are only allowing students with high enough grades. I think schools should not require students to have a grade of at least a B grade average because it would prevent some great athletes from entering sports, it would make less people interested in sports, and it would make students more nervous in school. I hope this letter is convincing. First, it would prevent good athletes from entering sports. Most students don't have a grade average of a B and have a grade average of a C. if you prevent students from entering sports that don't have an average of a B, less people would join sports or other activities because of there grade average. Second, less people would join activities and sports because they would have to bring up there grade average. if only people that had a grade average of a B joined sports, there would be a considerably smaller amount of people joining sports. also less people would join sports and activities because most of there friends wouldn't be able to do activities and sports with them. clearly you should allow students to join without a grade average of a B. Lastly, it would make student more nervous. If only students that had a grade average of a B joined sports and activities, than students would be nervous because they would have to work very hard to keep there graded up to a B average. the students would be very nervous during tests and quizzes and it could even bring there grads down even lower. clearly everyone should be allowed to do sports. in conclusion, all students should be allowed to do sports because less people would join sports, students would be nervous, and great athle","Imagine you are a student and your principal is forcing all students to participate in at least 1 after school activity and, you do not know if you should participate or not. In my opinion, I agree with the principal that all students should participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity due to the amount of fun, making friends, and less free time. Extracurricular activity can be so much fun and exciting, even if its a sport, helping with yearbook or even serving on the school council. But, remember not all activities are fun to you. What makes a extracurricular activity fun is that it makes that person happy of what he or she is doing. For example, In middle school my friend and I both tryout for our school Football team and Basketball team. After we tryout, My friend decided to do football than basketball because she like throwing and catching the ball unlike myself I prefer basketball over football because I like shooting and having supportive teammates. This example shows that extracurricular activities can be fun when you find the one that most interest you. Another reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is the people they are going to meet. When playing a sport or joining a club students are going to meet all different kinds of girls and boys that they probably never seen or talked to in their entire life. Doing these after school activities helps the students bond with other kids or even help them become friends. For example, there is a girl she new to your school and she does not really have friends but, she likes to draw. So, she sign up for the art club and see bunch of kids from her class that also sign up for art. At first, she was nervous then she and the other students started talking and were getting along well. This example explains that joining a club or sport team can bring you closer to new people. Even though extracurricular activities can be fun and bring people closer it can also take up a bunch of free time. Some students will just wake up, go to school, do homework, sleep, and repeat every single day. Doing after school activities such as basketball, soccer, yearbook, art and etc. Can keep students busy from around 1 hour or 2. For example, when I was in 6th grade I did not do any extracurricular activities but, when I tryout for basketball and made it. It kept myself pretty busy all afternoon everyday. Now, I wish I had so free time for myself. But, all the example was explaining that doing clubs and sports kept students busy. To mostly sum up everything, students should a least give it a try to participate in their schools extracurricular activities to see if they will have fun or even meet new people. That's why I believe students should participate due to amount of fun, making friends, and less free time.","Driverless cars is a cool invention. Everyone wishes they can have a driverless car. The cars could be very dangerous also. Drivers still have to be aware because you never know what can happen. The cars are also dangerous because it is not truly driverless, it may not alert you sometimes, and and can cause you accidents in a constrution area. Driverless cars aren't truly driveless. They can cause bad accidents because of that. The driver should always stay alerted while in the car because anything can happen. In the text it informs us that ""Google driverless cars have driven more than a half a million miles without a crash."" I'm sure the drivers were still alerted so they wouldn't crash. The driverless may not alert you sometimes. You never know when something can go wrong with the car that can mess up the alert system. In the text it say ""they can steer, accelerate , and brakes themselves,"" that can be a bad thing because if the car had a problem it could use one of those in the wrong situation like accelerating in a workzone area or braking on the expressway. It can also cause you to have accidents in a constrution work area. Driverless cars aren't perfect so it can mess up at anytime. It basically have a mind of it own so you should always be alert. You can easily have an accident because you'll be fascinated by the driverless car that you wouldn't be alerted. in the text it says"" it has complicated traffic issues such as navagating through roadwork or accidents. Driverless cars aren't truly safe. You should always be alerted because you'll never know what'll happen. It can cause serious accidents and you can get seriously injured, not just you other people too. It has a mind of its own and human drivers shouldn't a hundred percent trust a driverless car.","From riding horses with wagons to, drivng cars. this has been a big impact on everyones life. some people drive their cars to get place to place. Others either ride a bike or even they walk to get to where they need to be. In other words some people use cars and some people dont have the money to or just dont want to. So the qeustion remains does not having cars have a affect on our lifes? Perhaps people think that everyone in the world needs a car that is not true. For example:In the artical Heidrun Walter said that""When i had a car i was always so tense. Im much happier this way."" He said this because he even moved to Vauban where 70% of the families do not own cars and 57% sold their cars to move there. my next example will be by David Goldberg he says: ""all of our development since ww2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. And i think he is right most people in the world are focuse on what knd of car to get and how much they cost. Well maybe we as the people should spen a little less time on cars and a little more on how to better the economy. Next, In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Because if this happening it will end up that the world will have less accidents on the roads and highways so that means that we will have less people dying becaues of the accidents. For my next example: Vauban homes are 5500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for paking. In this new approch, stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. The other way to look at it is that hw are people going to get to work? How are they going to get to the store? Well how are people going to do all these thinds if the dont have a car. If all the car in the world was banned that woould be a bad idea because people would have to star knowing all of the bus,train and subway scheduals so that they would be able to get to work on time. But if they had a car they would not have to do all of that they would just get in to their car and go. Another reason what if you miss your ride to work and your already late then you would have to make a choice to either what for another bus or walk to work either way you are going to end up be late to work. this plan only works if everything that you want and need are very close to where you live and most of the time everything that we want and need are not even close to where we live and way to far to walk. People all over the world depend a lot on cars but we shouldnt. A lot of time i think that people in america are just being lazy. If you think about it if we take all the cars away then we wouldnt have to pay for gas,insurance, or for that matter buy a car. If we do this everything would be much closer together and it would be in walkin distance and you would be able to save a lot of money.    ","Every student has dreamed about the idea of attending classes at home. Unconditionally, this very thought has already been emphasized ever since the invention of homework. Now, with the advancement in computers and technology, homework can be transformed into classwork that students can do throughout the day from the bed they sleep on. Many benefits are offered to both students and teachers when using online videos and conferencing for students at home. Almost every student has online access, encouraging sick and injured students to still do work at home without missing class time. Though a few problems exist with attending class from home, the benefits ultimately outweigh the negatives. With current day technology, students have access to the internet almost everywhere they go. With the introduction of Google's Chromebook more than 5 years ago , students are able to use their schools laptop for completing online work at their house. This encourages the idea that students don't need to have a phone or a home computer in order to complete work online. Even with no internet at home, students have the ability to go to the library to get free public WiFi. Thanks to another Google based website; Google Classroom is a website where teachers can create private online classes where they upload classwork and other useful information students can view via an invitation code to the class. With a site like Google Classroom, students have an extremely high chance of doing online work without much hassle, such as needing hard copies of the missed classwork and lessons. Theoretically speaking, hundreds of millions of students around the world already do this. This enchances the idea of ""Online Classwork"" instead of just ""Online homework, which many of us are already familiar with. Additionally, the incredible online accessiblity grants students who are sick, injured, or missed school because of snow days, the option to do work online. When students are sick or injured, they are highly advised to stay at home. This brings up the still occuring problem of missing assignments and lessons. By offering online lessons and assignments, these students are able to complete their classwork without being behind and having F's put in for assignments, even with an excused absence. Furthermore, if school is cancelled because of snow or even the spreading of the Coronavirus, teachers have the ability to assign online work to their students. Teachers also have the ability to post videos of the lessons, which may help the students in need. With that added benefit, both students and teachers have less work to worry about. This introduces the idea of saving time. With the addition of online lessons and classwork, students and teachers are being granted the ability to not miss a certain unit or lesson, limiting many students from falling behind on classwork and other assignments. However, there are a few negatives that come to play when it comes to online conferencing and classwork. As many adults are aware of by now, laziness is common amongst many teens. Students who don't feel like completing their online work will instead: play video games, hang out with friends, or do non-educational activities. While this is completely up to the student, online assignments can be brushed off and seen as useless if given many opportunities to fix that mistake. Along with laziness, students are more capable of cheating by looking up answers or asking friends whether or not they have completed certain online assignments. This limits students from learning and not taking classwork seriously, which possibly limits their potential of passing future tests. If a student does not understand an assignment they are doing even if their teacher uploaded a video of a lesson, the student will need to schedule a time to have a video conference with their teacher. This can be a problem due to the teacher being unavailable until a certain time, or unvailable the whole day. Even with the few added negatives of attending online classes from home, students are offered the ability to keep their grades up by doing school work online at home. Teachers can also save their time chasing down a student for missing assignments as long as the student is able to complete their work online. In conclusion, attending classes from home is a great idea for students in need, as they get the opportunity to complete their assignments without hassle, stay on top of class lessons, and save both their and their teachers time.","Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, the use of this technology to read the expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Schools are already incooperating technology into schools so much more these days. If were going to be doing more online learning it should at least be taught as a real person would teach it. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" this could help alot with online learning especially if your doing work at home and dont have a teach there present with you to further explain something. ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... So computers need to understand that too"" Technology is becoming a part of our lives more and more everyday. We see it eeverywhere we go now. Most people probably interact more with devices than with an actual human being. So why not make it easier for people to learn online with the use of Facial Action Coding System's We should incooperate face analysis devices into a schools to make it easier for students to learn online.

899,235,"Dear Principal; I think Policy 1 is the better one out of the two because communication in school is important. Telling people about relationships is always a big deal in school. So instead of the class being the place for talk, why not free time or lunch. It would cut the chatter during class and would let teachers get out the information to the whole class without any distractions. Since lots of people have the same classes they can tell their friends what is happening in that class, so they can be ready for it. Also to tell them about projects or tests that are happening in that class. Sports are another big thing that require communication. Not just to fellow teammates but to parents as well. Say if a practice is cancelled or a game gets moved up a day early how will you be able to contact your parents. Emails may not get read until the next day, and if all the team calls on the office or nurse's phone then that will interrupt class time. Instead of all that chaos they can just call their parents on their phones or send them a text. So if you haven't been able to figure it out yet, Policy 1 is a much better choice than Policy 2. Also the students will be happier with the principal for allowing them to use their phones at all. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      ","Dear Principle, I believe that only allowing students with a grade B average to play sports is wrong and unfair. This is because without sports, students will lose their hobbies and it can get in the way of sporting careers that they may want to follow. Students can also get scholarships for sports which can help a lot if they're not strong in other subjects. Some students only like one thing. Sports. If they can't do the one thing they enjoy they may give up in school which will only lower their grades. Banning sports from the majority of the school might also lead the school to forfeit their games because they might not have enough players to play the game. Another reason why this rule is unfair is because maybe a student is aiming to get a scholarship in college from their athleticism. This is because they want to go to college to get a good job but might have a hard time making it because they aren't doing so well in school. Therefore, students start sports to go to a good college. To achieve a good sporting career, many students start on school sports teams and gradually get better and better at the sport they love. If students aren't allowed to play on the sports team just because they have an average grade in school they can't follow their career of choice and they might end up with a job that they do not enjoy. As you can see, banning sports from the majority of the school can lead to students lowering their grades and the school forfeiting their games. This also takes away the rights of students. This rule should not be made because it is unfair to most of the students.","Extracurricular activities are very good for kids. I believe making students participate in different activities can be a benefit for them. Not only would it be good for the students but I believe it can make schools healthier and have a better environment. There are many activities students can choose from so every kid can do something to fit his or her interests. I agree with making kids participate in different activities because by making students participate in extracurricular activities then kids can build friendships and bonds with one another, students can learn how to work with a team, and students can stay active with certain activities. First of all, if students have to do different school activities then it can help them build new friendships or bonds. If a student wants to go out of his or her comfort zone and try something new then they might meet new people. If a student wants to keep it the same and do something he or she is interested in then students can be around people that share the same interests. Making new friends is always good for kids, especially in school. If student were to make new friends I believe it can make school healthier for kids. Second, I believe that if students participate in certain activities, then kids can learn to work with a team. Students that play sports, work with the yearbook club, and serve for student council all work with with team members and can learn how to work as a team. Learning how to work with a team is good for students because it will benefit towards them when they get a job. Working with a team can also teach kids to work with other people that they might not know. Good teamwork is very good for students and can benefit the school by making it a better place. Lastly, I believe by participating in extracurricular activities then it can help kids be more active and healthy. Participating in sports is a great way for students to stay active and healthy. Track is a good sport that all kids can do because it is non contact, kids can be outside, and there are no tryouts. Being active can also keep kids nowadays from being to overweight, which is a problem that kids face because they don't get the daily exercise that is needed. Keeping kids active is very good for there bodies and it can keep kids healthy. Participating in extracurricular school activities is great for students. By making kids participate in different activities can benefit towards the students and the school. If students were to participate in different activities they could create new clubs to fit the interests of him or herself and expand the activities in schools. I believe students should always participate in school activities whether it is forced or not because school activities can be very fun. In conclusion, I highly agree with the idea of making students participate in extracurricular activities because it can help kids build new friendships, teach kids how to work with a team, and help students stay active.","Cars that drive themselves seem very fututistic, but we are very close to successfully making a car like this. There are many obvious benefits to manufacturing cars like this. I think the most important benefit is in our enviroment. Some other benefits are that we won't have as many deathly car crashes and we would still be able to take control of the vehicle if needed. We shouldn't be scared to make this change that could potentialy change our future for the better. Our enviroment has severely suffered from the massive carbon footprint that our generations have left. A big issue we have is that our air is very polluted. A big factor in this is that billions of people use cars all over the world. This self driving car would use half of the fuel that our cars today use. This could greatly decrease our pollution in big cities all over the world. Car crashes are one of the biggest contributors to our death rate. There are many innocent people who die every day due to other people not paying attention to the road. Google has a car that is somewhat driverless and hasn't crashed once even though they have driven half a million miles. The technology that would be used in these cars would be smart enough to drive safely and alert the person in the vehicle when human assistance is needed. We have the ability to save many men, women, and children by allowing the self driven cars to transport us. Many skeptical people think that giving up control could lead to accidents. When the car senses that there is danger ahead, they alert the person that they need to take over. If someone notices something the car doesn't, they can just put their hands on the wheel. People could still drive their cars if they felt necessary. We wouldn't be fully giving up control if we can just take it right back. Now you see that there are many benefits to making self driven cars. The possibility of some minor negative things that can be fixed, doesn't compare to the positive results we can gaurentee this vehicle might bring. The enviroment will be much better and we will have healthier air to breathe, because we will use less fuel. Our death rates will go down and we can save our future generations with these safe cars. Finally, if anything does happen, we can take back the control of the car at any second. The people of this world will thank us for bringing this self driven car to the streets.          ","Have you ever thought its time for change? Germany, New York , Columbia , and the United states are trying to reduce cars driven. Many benifits are coming from the downfall of cars being driven. Less stress, no smog from pollution, and less money spent on expensive cars. Vauban's streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter says she is less tense and much happier without a car. Walking, bycicling, and hyking are much more eco friendly. In 2006 a trend is growing in Europe. Vauban home to 5,500 residents may be the most expieriment in low car suburban life. Car ownership is allowed but there are few places to park large garages and the edge of development. 70 percent do not own cars and 57 percent sold cars to move to Vauban. Car pollution is at its all time high, in paris motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home due to smog. 67 percent of vehicles in France use diesel fuel. Only 53.3 percent make up the rest of western europe. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gases, and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states. Chicago to Shanghai people tend to make their homes which is a huge reduce of green house gas emissions from tailpipes. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years pass. Americas love for vehicles seems to be coolig down. The number of miles driven dropped in 2005 and continued droppimg steadily. In 2013 the number of miles driven was nearly 9 percent below its peak. If this persists there will be beneficialimplications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Last year a study was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. This is why life today would be fantastic and more benifitcial with car free cities and more walking, bycicling and hyking. less stress, less pollution, and less money spent on cars. As days continue the percentage of cars and miles driven decreases drastically.                                    ","Getting to school everyday may not be possible to many students based on their circumstances. To others, their mental health might put them in a position where they are not able to reach their full potential at school, causing their grades to suffer. Whatever the reason may be, taking classes online is a convenient way of being present in school while also meeting the needs of those who need it. Schools offering online classes to students would be a grand benefit to all students, and could make a profound impact on their learning and their grades. Mental health is a big issue in many teens and often gets in the way of learning; however, distance learning could be a solution to this problem. For example, some students have social anxiety, so going to a crowded school is hard for them. This mental disorder could and often will impact their learning, not allowing students to reach their full potential. If being in a school with a large number of students is upsetting to them, they could take their classes from home. This would allow them to still be able to pursue an education while not being in a triggering environment, which could make a large impact on their grades. In the comfort of their homes, students would be able to move at their own pace to make sure they know the material, stimulating academic success. Some students may have different circumstances in which they are not able to go to school everyday, but distance learning could help them get the education they need despite these circumstances. For instance, what if a student has to stay home to take care of their sick mother. Because the student needs to stay at home, online classes would be a grand benefit to them. Online classes would allow the student to be able to check up on his mother while still getting an education. With these classes, the student wouldn't have to sacrifice school for his mother, or vice versa: he would be able to do school and care for his mother at the same time. Sickness often leads students with two options: go to school and run the risk of infecting others, or staying at home while everyone else is learning, ultimately causing them to be left behind in school. Many students wake up sick but still choose to go to school because they are afraid of being left behind and have their grades suffer, especially in more advanced classes. Going to school puts the other students that they come into contact with at a risk of getting sick, and is the main reason how sickness spreads in schools. With the availability of distance learning, however, students who are sick would be more likely to stay at home instead of going to school and contaminating others. They could rest at home and wait out the sickness while not being stressed out about missing school and having to make up work for all of their classes. Online classes are a huge benefit that provides students who are sick with an opportunity to keep up with their school work while not putting others at risk. In total, distance learning and online classes provides a chance for students to be able to attend school despite their different circumstances. Students would not have to stress out about missing school because they would be able to attend class from home, which would make a positive impact on their grades. Other students wouldn't have to make a choice to pursue an education or care for their sick relative. Some students wouldn't have to choose between their mental health and the opportunity to go to school. They wouldn't have to run the risk of getting other students sick and missing valuable school time. Instead, they would be able to do classwork from home which would make it significantly easier for these individuals to go to school without sacrificing anything. Online classes would allow all students to have an equal opportunity to have an education, regardless of circumstances that would hold them back should distance learning not be available to them. ","In my opinion, yes that would be very helpful and valuable to have that type of technology in our classrooms. heres why. A lot of students hide all of their emotions and hold them inside and that sometimes can make us do crazy irrational things, like shooting up a school full of kids. If we had this technology we could figure out how a student feels and try our best and do whatever we can to help them before it gets to that point. If we had that technology we would be able to get a student into counciling or to a therapist or just to a close friend to talk to because who knows that could save that students life. If we knew what was bothering students or knew that there was something bothering a student we could maybe avoid all of those student v. s. teacher fights that happen because that student isnt in the right mindset and that teacher had no idea. Another reason why that type of technology would be useful is learning. Say a student was doing some school work on a computer and they start falling asleep because the content is so boring. If we had that type of technology the computer could change the way the content is being presented into a wat that is more interesting and exciting to the student. Every student learns differently and if we had that technology then we all could excel in school. Not only could we learn better and help the teachers understnad us better we could understand the people around us better. We could learn how to recognize those faces and understand how the person we are talking to is really feeling. Not only that we could make a whole new lie detector test for authorities. If they had those they could truely find out if someone is guilty because as the passage said faces dont lie. Maybe if we had that type of technology helping the law the crime rate would go down emencely because if criminals knew that no matter what they did they would always fail this test if they lied they wouldnt commit those crimes and risk getting caught. In conclusion, having this technology could help the world beyond our imagination. If we had this, maybe, just maybe our dreams for a better place might start to become true.",,,,,,,
899,494,"Dear Principal, I think that policy one is a better option because that way students can use their phone if they need to. Limiting cell phone use to their lunch period and free time is a wise choice because then their is no way they can get distracted in school with the feeling of wanting to check their phone all the time because they will have the option to do so. At my school we don't have the option to use our phones. We can bring them to school but the rule is that they have to be off and in our lockers the whole day. Now what really happens is that kids will keep their phones in their pocket and whenever they feel bored in class they will pull them out and start using them. I see all kinds of texting in my class that teachers don't know about because kids know how to hide them. If you give them the option to use their phones at appropriate times I think it will limit texting in class. Another reason you should allow kids to use their phone during free time and lunch is because in class the teacher may ask a question but never get around to answering it. The kid can then use his or her phone to google the question and come up with an answer. I know in my classes the teacher can be talking and ask a question but never get around to answering it. It bugs me so bad! But since we aren't allowed to use our phones in school we have to wait until we get home or on the bus. Well by that time most of us have already forgotten the question. So we never know the answer. One final reason is suppose a kid gets sick. Most kids don't like to go to the nurse's office. I know I don't. So if the kid can wait until lunch or his free time he can then call his parents to come get him so he doesn't have to stay at school sick. At my school if you get sick and you don't want to go to the nurse you are stuck at school. No matter how bad you feel. You can ask the teachers if you can call your mom but they always ask why. If you tell them your sick they make you go to the nurse. If you go to the nurse unless you have a fever, no matter how bad you feel, they make you stay in school. But what are you going to learn if your sick? Nothing! You can also get other kids sick that way. So if you let your kids use their phones, school might be a little easier to handle. You might want to consider letting them use their phones. It might end up helping your school! But of course the downside is what if they forget to turn off their phones? Well I guess you will still have to have some rule about taking their phones away. I hope these ideas will help you make a decision on allowing your kids to use cell phones in school. Sincerely, Student","To the Principal: I believe that everyone has a right to do anything they want, if they want to be a football player, cheer leader and or, volley ball player, then let them. A's are great and B's are good, and that C's are passing but are not the best everyone can do but not every is a genius. So, what i'm trying to say is, That if you (Miss Principal) change the policy, that's how you feel, but now how i feel. I know some people are really smart, and i know many people at my school that are very athletic and have C's and now since you changed the school average for sports all the best athletes are off the team. Would you really starve them of their dreams like? I think you should move the B grade back to a C. Sports is what people do to keep them out of trouble. Hopefully you will take my letter in to consideration. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Have your parents ever forced you to do a sport? You usually end up not having fun. If you're doing activities against your will, why would you want to bring that to school? Extra curricular activities shouldn't be enforced because it interferes with the parents' schedule, it takes away the students' factor of choice, and it prevents teachers from going home at their typical time. To start off, enforcing after school activities isn't a great idea because it can interfere with parents' schedules. For example, parents might not be able to pick up their kids late, possibly due to the fact that they need someone to help out with their younger children. If kids are held after school, the parents will need to rearrange their schedule in order to be there for their kids. In addition, this policy could prevent the parents from being able to pick their kids up. depending on how late the extracurricular activities run, parents could be busy with other things, such as grocery shopping, by the time their kid gets out of school. Also, some parents depend on public transportation. If there isn't a conveniently scheduled bus, the child won't have a way to get home. These scenarios demonstrate how enforcing clubs, sports, or groups can intervene with parents' schedules. Secondly, having extracurricular activities after school as a priority isn't a good idea because it takes away the student's factor of choice. Adding on, children won't be as independent as they would have been, which will effect them later in life. If they don't build their individuality now, then they could possibly have trouble with it in years to come. In addition, students could feel controlled. If these policies are made, kids could feel like they don't have a say in what goes on in their space of education. Also, children will have to schedule their outside life around after school. They might be put in a position where they have to let go of activities they're passionate in, simply to not get in trouble at school. These three examples show why extracurricular policies will take away a child's choice. Lastly, making extracurricular activities a necessity isn't an great decision because it forces teachers to stay later. To start, teachers have a life after school, and staying later than normal could interfere on that. Also, educators might have to complete chores, such as buying groceries, before a certain time each day. Having them stay late could throw off their whole routine. Lastly, many teachers have kids of their own. Depending on their age(s), they will get dismissed from school at different times. This is why necasary extracurricular activities will affect a teacher's schedule. As shown in these paragraphs, enforcing extracurricular activities can affect the parents' everyday plan, prevent kids from making their own choices, and interfere with teachers' after school life. Holding back students affects more than just the kids. It affects everyone involved, and more. With these explanations, hopefully you won't be forced to play a sport or join a group again.","I think driverless cars are a really good idea to be hounist I'm going to tell you why I think it's a good idea. The first reason why I think it's a good idea is, because if the cars are able to dive themselfs we the people will see less crashes on the rodes. Lets take I-65 for an example we the people see the news and we see and hear about all the crashes that happen on there. We also can look at I-70 as well its not as bad as I-65 though. Here is another reson I think everyone should have a driverless car. I am a driver of my own. I get scared sometimes when i am on I-65 going to indy or anywhere like that. The reason being I dont want to get hit just going to the mall with some of my friends thats not what I want. This is what i want though. I want to be able to go place to place without hlaf to think or WORRY about any of the stupid people on the rodes. I mean take a moment to think about how much better the rodes will be if stupid people can not drive places where they want to go. If people wanted to go some where the car will drive them there all we the peopel have to do is sit there and talk and have some fun. wouldn't that be so much fun though. There will be a lot less crashes and people dieing because of it. The last thing that I would want to say is, lets thinks about all the little kids that are in the car and all the little kids getting hurt form being in a car where some stupid person hit the car and the kids get ether really hurt or even die. Just think about that for a litte bit. and Thinks about it when you drive today or when you start driveing. Dont be a stupid kid and race peopel and do bren outs and stuypid stuff like that. All you have to do is drive to one place to another. That is really all I have too, want too, and need too say. About all of this. So if you ask me how I feel just remebre this essay. So yes i think we all need too get one of the driverless cars. Thank you, PROPER_NAME","Have you ever known how if feels not being able to breath? If you haven't then you probably will someday. Breathing is something every living thing has to do to survive. At that another question. Have you ever made the connection between driving and breathing? Pollution is the connection, in europe twelve percent of the green house gases are from the muffler. In the extreamest of places like Beijin there is so much exhaust in the air that you can see it. They call this smog, smog is very dangerous, breathing large amounts could easily lead to lung cancer. People all around the world are looking for the solution to this horrible problem. Hybrid cars some say, others solve the problem and live in car free comunities. There are great advantages to car free comunities. The main dis advantage being that if you have to travel far you would have to use public transportation. The main advantages are that there is no car exhaust in the air. Also there is no road rage or traffic jams to worry about. Car-less comunities are spreading and one day we might factor out car exhaust as pollution and as a problem. In major cities like paris they couldn't ban all driving so they compromised and made limitations on driving and giving small fines to non cooaperating drivers. congestion went down sixty percent in Paris in five days of limited driving. If we all just try and limit our driving a little we could help everyone breath a little better. If we control it now we could get rid of the issue before we are fined like the four thousand in France that week. Next time you jump in your car and fire the engine up take time to think about who you could keep from breathing fresh air; maybe one day it could happen to you.             ","Alarm goes off at 7:00 and it's time to get ready for school. I'll be there for the next 7 hours of my day, being lectured and taught new things every block. In my head I think to myself, I wish I was at home right now. Although staying home from school can sometimes be a luxury, the importance of face-to-face learning is promonate. Being present in class everyday is more beneficial then home bound learning. By showing up to class, I have the opportunity to ask more questions and recieve help easier and quicker than it would be if I was at home. For most, we finish school and have a job to attend. Waking up and going to school everyday, prepares us to continue this in our careers later in life. If the habit of not going to school carrys into work, the danger of losing that position is great. Without going ot school, there would be no preperation for what's to come in the future. Showing up to school and trying your hardest is the best thing you can do to set up the rest of one's life. Not only does being in school prepare you for later, it also impacts the level of motivation. School and workload inspires motivation and creativity. As I listen to my teacher, I go through my head and figure out what needs to be done in class today inorder to achieve my goals. In school, I have the space to think openly without having other thoughts run through my head. Studies have shown that when someone does work in their bedroom, their brain doesn't allow their work to be their best work because it associates the room with sleep and relaxation; where as, the brain associates school with learning and growth. When working at home, I get the feeling that what I'm doing can wait and there is no rush to have it done. Procrastination later leads to being stressed over something that you could've prevented. Working at home not only creates stress, but can also lead to depression. School gives students a social outlet as well as the learning prospective. Studies prove that being isolated in one room for a long period of time can affect mental health. If someone were to do school from home for their entire life, their mental health could be impacted because they do nothing but sit and work and later realx and sleep but in the same area the work was being done. By going to school, students get to learn through experience as well as lectures. Making friends and relationships can teach someone more than what a textbook can teach. Having provided help and learning from peers, school can help someone grow and experience things that can positivley effect them for the rest of their lives. School is important in growing up and being a part of activities with peers can help one exceed their goals and possibilities.         ","Imagen just looking at your computer and your computer telling your emotions. Do you think that is a good think? I believe that it is i good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring to you, help you understand what you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work. One reason why it is a good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring for you. The computer can help find a video or something that can help the work be for fun or extced for you. For example, say that I do not like math or i can not figure out what the answer is because i am bored the computer can find a video to help me. Another reason, is it can help you learn something you do not know. For example say the teacher does not explain a problem correctly and so the computer looks up a video or something that can explain the problem. Last reason, is the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work. For example the computer will look at your face and will see that you can not do a problem and sees your frustration and the computer will look uo an article,video,etc.. that will help you and it will give you instuctions on how to do something. In conclusion, as you can see the technology to read the emotinal expressions of student's is a great idea because it can help you something that boring to you, help you understand something that you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

899,563,"Dear, whoever this may concern, I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and during free time, as long as we turn them off during class time. If we didn't bring phones to school something bad COULD happen. For example we could be walking home and somebody could be following us, phones aren't just for texting or calling our friends, they are also used for emergencies too. first, we could get kidnapped walking home from school or walking home from the bus stop. Many kids are being taken while walking home or to a friends house. If we had cell phones at school with us then we could maybe call somebody if we are suspicious about the people in our surroundings. If we are just walking home not in a group then, we could get kidnapped. Second if we aren't sure about our surroundings and we get lost we can call somebody to help us get to where we are going. I know that if I had just moved into a new neighborhood, and i didn't exactly where I was going, I would most likely get lost. If that was to every happen a kid or a teenager who owned a cell phone would be able to call someone for help on where to go. If we got lost we could walk to a street sign and tell the person where we are at if you can get a hold of somebody. If we want to go somewhere after school instead of going straight home, could cal our parents to ask for permission. Some parents like to call their kids after they get out of school to make sure they are okay. cell phones are a way for a parent to get a hold of their kids. If us kids aren't home around the time we usually are the parents get worried, unless you have called them and told them that you are going to go somewhere after school. Some parents might make their kids bring their phone to school even if they aren't allowed, just to make sure that the kids are safe. I think we should be allowed to bring cell phones to school because they are used in emergencies, such as getting kidnapped, lost, or just a way for parents to get a hold of their kids. Cell phones are important to parents just as they are to kids too.","Dear Principle, I believe that only allowing students with a grade B average to play sports is wrong and unfair. This is because without sports, students will lose their hobbies and it can get in the way of sporting careers that they may want to follow. Students can also get scholarships for sports which can help a lot if they're not strong in other subjects. Some students only like one thing. Sports. If they can't do the one thing they enjoy they may give up in school which will only lower their grades. Banning sports from the majority of the school might also lead the school to forfeit their games because they might not have enough players to play the game. Another reason why this rule is unfair is because maybe a student is aiming to get a scholarship in college from their athleticism. This is because they want to go to college to get a good job but might have a hard time making it because they aren't doing so well in school. Therefore, students start sports to go to a good college. To achieve a good sporting career, many students start on school sports teams and gradually get better and better at the sport they love. If students aren't allowed to play on the sports team just because they have an average grade in school they can't follow their career of choice and they might end up with a job that they do not enjoy. As you can see, banning sports from the majority of the school can lead to students lowering their grades and the school forfeiting their games. This also takes away the rights of students. This rule should not be made because it is unfair to most of the students.","Extracurricular activities is something that doesn't always amaze kids especially not by force. A extracurricular activity are things such as sports, run for student council, work on the yearbook. As a principle of any school you should want a child to participate in some kind of activity but that's not something that should be forced on them. It may seem like a good idea to enforce a rule that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, but in my perspective I don't like the principles idea and I have a couple of reasons why. The first reason is because, as a kid we don't like being forced to do things. Yes, it's good to give a child a push at something so they can try a new thing and maybe it will be apart of their future; but if a principle or person forces it on them it may stop the child from doing it ever again. They may get the idea that they have no say in what they do. My next reasoning is that what if a child takes his or her time doing another activity outside of school, handling both things could be a lot of pressure and cause stress because they still have several other things to worry about. The kid might get to thinking ""this is to much"" and ""this is a lot to worry about"" and it may cause them to not want to do anything in life if they don't find what they're doing is something they enjoy. The principle should make it a option instead of a rule or something you have to do. I believe whatever activity a child participates in they should be willing to do it and should be something they are amazed by. The principle should take his idea into thought and see how the students feel. The students should have good reasoning for why they agree or disagree with the principle. The point behind my reasons is that as a adult you have to consider what the child wants sometimes. What you may think is best for a child isn't always what they want. If you demand them to do a lot of things their whole mind set could change on how life should be. ","Sure technology is great but, can we really trust it? Self driving cars are quickly approaching, so before they are here we must go over the negative aspects it will have. My stance on self driving cars is, they are unsafe and not perfectly created A few problems we might encounter with a self driving car is, problems with the law, and technology issues/malfunction. The law states that its main focus is keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Laws assume the only safe way to acheive that is with alert drivers. How can we trust a robot to drive a vehicle, with no real thought process? What if they malfunction and someone gets injured, then we have discuss whos liable and its a big ordeal. The text states "" New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" The main message is who is liable for a mistake in the cars accident? The driver or the manufacturer? Secondly, Computer malfunction and technology issues have been occuring since the dawn of computers. So, whos to say it wont happen to a car? Smart cars are relished to be great and accident free but in the case of an electronic malfunction, I beg to differ. Also, are hackers able to tune into your car and mess it up electronically? YES! By bypassing your cars security system, they will have full access to your car from the inside, and be able to shut it down or cut off certain features. So the smartest move is to stick with manually driven cars for the safety and concern of our people. But they are currently working on these issues as stated "" Automakers are continuing their work on the assuption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Smart cars may be a new intuitive way to drive a car, but they need to be more harshly critisized for the safety of young children and adults. Sure smart cars can be safe and effective but they MUST be one-hundred percent proven and out of technological disorder for the maximum protention of our countries people.","There can be many reason why people had decided to stop using there cars and start doing more activities. First, cars waste money and gas and the gasonline burns and gases comes out and goes in the air. However, they pollution is destroying the air and leaving smog behind. Therefore, people should stop using there cars and think what should they do for the environment. Using less motor vechicles are less important than the environment, the world we live in. First, cars waste money and gas and the gasonline burns and gases comes out and goes in the air? We are wasting so much money on gasonline everyday and its ruining the air. Why because when the fuel burns, the gases comes out of the tanks and into the air and that's how we cause smog. We need air not chemicals to breathe and plants to help us breathe oxygen. We need sunlight so stay warm and have the plants and animals to eat and so we can stay health. What if you can you don't have to use the car for one month how would you feel about the air and the pollutionh without cars? However, they pollution is destroying the air and leaving smog behind? It's true that we are sometimes breathing in smog. It's disturbing that we have to breathe it in and out. We need to stop using cars and trying to figure out what we can do to protect the environment and the commiunty to help us. Many countries have smog and you can't be able to see the sun. Don't you want to end up like that place, and do want to be safe. Plus if we stop using cars and more into the environmentm we can connect to the people and other resources. Many people have a lot of stress when they are driving, what would you think if they got more connected to the world and having more social. They and even you can have a better life and having a good time socialing with others. Therefore, people should stop using there cars and think what should they do for the environment. Using less motor vechicles are less important than the environment, the world we live in. Many teenagers want to learn how to drive or wants to get there new car. But they don't notice other stuff going on in our world, they think they are more important than the world. But can you notice sometimes the most teens don't need cars like pther places because they don't need it and spend money on gas. Half the population had dropped of the percentage of teens driving. What can you do without cars and people who don't need it are better of having a life than people who spend on money on cars. As a result, what can you do for the world without the cars and think about the air. Make a community without and motor vehicles and a better place for your have to live in. What would you have to do to stop using your cars and figure out a way to do transportation to a place you have to go. But had you know that in New York and France us there bikes to get to places. Because its a big place and not enough room to have cars to get to places. Plus its helps you stay fit and healthy. So think about the air and what can you do for the popluatin with people that have cars.    ","Schools that have the option to attend classes online or video conferencing, are more likely to improve students learning. Since 2009 schools started to provide this program to the community. Most of the families on the area thought this program was useless, but families from far distance thought this was a brilliant idea. This programs took place at Generic_School. There were around ninety-two students involve. The first year was a success, and so the second one. After that the numbers of students started to decrease. Why there were less students involve to the program?. What can we do to fix this issue? Why people from the area thought this was useless?. Why people from far distance thought this was a brilliant idea?. When this program for students to attend classes online or video conferencing took place at Generic_School on September 2, 2009. There were ninety-two students involve, all of them liked this program but only the 70% of them joined for the next year. The second year only sixty-five joined the classes online. The comments they left were; ""It's nice to be home and take classes online, and its awesome to no worry about being late to class, but as a student i've love to share ideas, thoughts with other students"". Since the third year of this program the number of students decrease to 10%. Since 2011 about twenty students joined the online program. The numbers decrease because students felt that being home all day was boring. No being able to share ideas with other students or get engage with them. Students thought they needed more activities and less standing in only one place. There are some ways to get students interested again to the program. On the online classes there are choices before joining any class. Those choices are that if she/he is willing to go out and do projects with others students that are taking the same classes as them. They are able to chat with them and get information,and choose the day of the meeting. But if they don't want they could either do video chat with other students or just a voice chat. Other options could be that students will have the option to visit the school once a week or once a month. If this options works, for sure more and more students will be involve. Many folks from the area in 2009 thought that this online classes were useless, because since it was opened for anyone less and less students will attend to school. Some of those families even came to talk to the principal and said "" For many years our goal is to get students to attend to school, and with program out our goal will fail"", as a respond. The principal said "" For sure, we want as many students possible to attend school, but for some reasons not all them can make to school, and as a benefit and an opportunity for others to learn we decide to make this program"". The principal made many reunions with parents that disagree with this idea. After a month must of them accepted and understood the goal of the program. People from far distance thought this was a brilliant idea, because they will not have to travel long time of terms everyday to get to school. Money will be save, and a great and big opportunity for their kids to learn from home. Families from far distance came together and as a act of greatness, they made donation to the school for actives such as soccer, track or others. The school knew that they really made the families happy and that was their goal. Happiness and make everyone comfortable in their leaning. Schools should always look out for those that don't have the opportunity to travel to school, or live far from schools. Those who travel or cant travel to school because of the distance they have between their home and school, now the opportunity to save money, prepare their self to a better feature. Online or video conferencing classes are a really a big way to start helping the community. After that program and if it became a success, Generic_City should see what are other ways they can do to help the community and make their learning easier. So that many teenagers will success in life.","The Facial Action Coding System would be cool. It would be cool if it can read your expressions. It would learn to read your face. It would give you things you like. It wouldnt give you things you dont like. It would be made just for you. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. It classifies six basic emotions. The six emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer model will learn exactly what your thinking. This will allow it to get to know you. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared to a neutral face. The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. If you smile a web ad appears on your screen, it will know you like it. If you frown, it will know you don't. The Facial Action Coding System will be helpful in the classroom. It would allow the computer to pop things on the screen that are a interest to you. You will be able to learn more because you will have more information on them. It will keep you focused in the classroom, and it will help you learn. The Facial Action Coding System with its use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. After learning the 44 muscles of your face they will know what you like and you dont like. Your computer will be just for you. It will help students learn. It will also help them stay more focused.

899,923,"Dear Principal, I think that you should allow students to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned of because this way they wont be using them in classes because now they actually have time to use them and most people follow the rules and don't use there phones during school so now they can use them and not get in trouble i think this is a great idea and i think it will work because all every body will do is text or call each other and then when lunch is over they will turn them of and put away. Another reason is that many people dot have phone so for those people they just get free time and many other people just don't use there phone so it would be a free time for them to. but also there are people who will just sit there and text or call people the whole time. also the teachers will not have to fell like no one is paying attention because now there is no reason to text in class when you have lunch and all free time. so i think this would be a good change if it were to happened. Also i think that you would see a increase in peoples grades because they will now pay attention more to what the teacher has to say and not what there friends have to say also i think this because many people have good grade now i cant amagin what the grades would be like if people had time in school to use phones.","Dear Principle, Many Individuals in the school have an opinion on the choice you mad on the loud speaker. Students do not like the decision you have gave made. many students have a C average and the principle is taking away all there fun. I under stand the principle wants kids to work harder, but it doesn't mean the principle has to take all there fun away. students do not like this decision because the activities are all gone unless they get a B average. Every one in the school has to work harder, but the kids are trying to tell the principle that they have worked hard enough. Students come to school to do work every day but the principle takes all there activities. Activities are the only thing they have in school that is fun. the principle may think that the work is fun but it isn't. school is to always do work and understand what they are doing. the principle thinks they students come to school for the activities but no they don't. students come to school to work hard and to be a scholar and to go college but if taking away there activities is that important then so be it. Students try there best every day in school and have work hard enough. if the school wont let you participate then go participate in a program where they have a lot of your favorite sports. changing the school policy isn't fair for the students. students try there best every day and the principle has to take all there fun away. the students need to let the mothers and fathers know for that they can all stand up to the principle. show the principle how hard you can work and prove to him that he doesn't have the right to change the school policy and to let all your activities back. Us the students shouldn't take this mans word of changing the policy we must all speak and make sure you do your best to change it the way it was. The students should let the principle know that you all worked hard enough. the principle should just wants them to work hard but the principle doesn't get that they have worked hard enough. having a C average isn't bad. the principle is crushing the kids dreams of activities. many students would have many bad things to say about the school. many parents would do anything for there child to keep succeeding and to have activities. students would love activities and the worse thing to do is to take away there activities. many students have the privileged to get a B average but what if all don't make it. don't takeaway there activities away unless getting a -C,D, or even lower then that.. you should at least give a student a chance to get there grade higher with activities. activities also count as there grade so the more activities the more B s. activities count because gym teachers can grade also so when gym teachers grade it will make there grade go higher then a C. a C+ will take it there. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","If the principal decided that all students must do one extracurricular activity, I would most likely agree with it because I think it's good to get out the house and try new things. I think it would also help with making new friends and meeting new people. It could help them stay active and make them feel good about them self and could put them in a happier place and stands. And They could find something they really enjoy doing. There is a little part of me that makes me disagree a little. At home they could have a ruff home life so they have no ride home, their parents don't support them so they would not help out of come to there games or to the meetings for the activity, and they could not be able to get the stuff they need for that sport. I would say sports has really helped me make new friends and become a better person and stay active and fit. But for me I would have to go with agree because I think it is good for kids to stay active,to get out and ex- prole new things, make new friends, meet new people , staying active, and staying in shape. That could also mean that is there time to get away from everything like maybe something happening at home and they need a break or maybe they are getting bullied so that is there set away from everything. so I think I would say I am gonna go with agree.       ","The advancing of technology is unstoppable. When the driverless car is fully driverless, it will be revolutionary. That's why I believe that driverless cars are a great thing that will be fully added to our world one day. The driverless car could benefit the people of this world in many ways, it conserves gas, it's more safe than other ways of transportation, and it would cost less. One very important thing about the driverless car is that it conserves gas. The world is already in a mild gas problem as oil is a nonrenewable resource. This is because the people of the world use way too much gas every day for driving. These cars would use half the fuel that cars today use. That would make the price of gas go down and it would help our gas problem and make gas last for many more years. Driverless cars will be extermently safer than the cars we have today. I say this because it would cause less accidents. Let's say that someone had a little bit too much to drink but he or she is still alert enough to drive. Instead of taking the risk of crashing, he or she can get into the driverless car and only control it at a few moments. There would be a way less chance of he or she crashing and would make the roads way safer for every one else. The driverless car will save many families a ton of money. Instead of families buying their own car, they can call a Google driverless taxi when they need to go somewhere and not have to worry about the cost of gas. They also wouldn't have to worry about the price of buying a new car. The only places that would be losing money out of this is car dealerships. When the driverless cars become mainstream there wont be much need for car dealerships or even man driven cars. Driverless cars are going to be one of the biggest inventions in human history once they break their way into the mainstream. They would help out the world in many ways by conserving gas, making the world a safer place, and it would save familes a ton of money. When driverless cars are finally released to the public, the lives of almost every body in the world will be improved. ","Believe it or not there are ways people may be harming the environment without actually knowing it. If you really think about it though there are many ways you can help prevent harm to the environment. One of them is limiting car usage. The advantages to giving limits to this could be very helpful to restoring our world. A city in Germany has gone the extra mile to solve problems due to car use. What the residents of Vauban, an upscale suburban community have done is, they have all given up their cars. Street parking, driveways, and garages are not allowed. The only way to park is to buy a parking spot along with your home for $40,000. Because of this movement 70 percent of families there do not own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to move to Vauban. A media trainer and mother of two said that when she had a car she was always tense but now is much happier. This no car movement is called ""smart planning"". A reason it started is because studies have shown that passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in america. The basic ideas from Vauban are being adopted around the world attempting to make suburbs more compact with less space for parking. Now in the US many agencies are promoting car reduced communities. Also legislators are starting to act. Many say public transport in suburbs will play a much larger role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. More suburbs like this one could change the world. In Paris there had been days of near-record pollution. To help clear the city's air Paris enforced a partial driving ban. Monday, moterists with even numbered liscence plates were forced to leave their cars at home or pay a $31 fine. Rejecting the fine resulted in having your car impounded. As a result 60 percent of congestion was down in France's capitol. The smog due to car usage was cleared enough on monday to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the next day. In Columbia a similar day is taken place every year. A car free day where people hiked, biked, skated and took buses to work instead of driving their cars. If you violated this you would be fined $25. Even in rainy weather people participated just to help lower stress and air pollution. This campaign has sparked a revolution. It has also created the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, parks, and sports centers. It has caused the replacement of pitted sidewalks with broad smooth ones, cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have appeared. If every country had a day like this we could make a unbelievable difference. According to recent studies Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer liscences each year. Even though America has basically been the birthplace of cars and is one of the world's prime car cultures its love seems to be cooling down. The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005 and steadily declined in the years following. In april 2009 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below its peak and equal to where it was in 1995. Part of the problem has most definitely been recession but as the economy recovers the decrease in driving has not changed. According to a research proffessor at University Of Michigan car ownership per household started to lower two to three years before the downturn. If this trend persists it will have benificial implications for carbon emmissions and the environment. One of the things causing this is the internet which allows people to feel more connected to eachother without driving to meet friends. Also people car-pooling and biking have helped. There has been a large drop in peoples age 16-20 getting their liscence. They organize summer jobs and their social lives around where they can walk or take public transportation, or carpool. Between 2001 and 2009 driving by young people decreased 23 percent. All of this helps conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety. In conclusion there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Many communities have taken part of this trend and it is rapidly being recognized around the world. Taking part in this helps the community and environment. Anyone can do it.    ","I do agree that some students would benefit from online classes, but not all of them would. There's people that learn better if they are in a classroom with a teacher standing in front of them. There's also people who struggle to listen correctly in the classroom. Those are the people that would heavily benefit from an online course. All of their distractions are eliminated and they can turn the volume up on their laptop if they struggle to listen. There are benefits from both being in a classroom and being in an online classroom. Since I agree that some would benefit, let's talk about why it's only ""some"". If you are like me, you would rather be in a classroom with other students who are learning the same things as you. Therefore, you can ask them for help if you missed something or just have a conversation on the topic. Just talking to others about what you're learning will grow your knowledge on the subject and you might even teach them a thing or two. This will also give you a chance to talk with the beautiful girls in your class! So, why are they both beneficial? I've never taken a class online, but it must be nice to bring the class wherever you want. So, if you're an on-the-go student, I would look into online courses. Anxiety is a big thing these days and I've heard of many people with ""classroom anxiety"". They are actually afraid to go to school and I cannot think of a better cure for that than online classes. On the other hand, people in the classroom can speak on the subject and teach each other new things as I said before. You have the luxury of asking the teacher for assistance. Being in a classroom also improves your people skills. We all know there is good and bad that come from online courses. These are some reasons why people think there is no good coming from it. You may not get the full learning experience from looking at your laptop rather than having someone with all the answers speaking to you and making you write them down. You have no social life while you're learning and you can't speak with classmates to learn more or get answers for a homework. If you're online learning, everything is on you! There is little help that comes with online classes rather than a real classroom. All in all, I agree that some students would benefit from online classes. Those who are very independent and portable would love online classes. I feel that there are more students who would rather stay in the classroom and converse to learn more. It's all about what each person prefers. Online courses are not for everyone but are definitely a great option.","The facial action coding system is an astonishing idea developed by proffesor Dr. Huang his invention has many contributions that would benifit us in our society today. The way that his system works is abrilliant idea that could not only tell us if a person is happy,sad,or angry but, those identifications of charechter can help us prevent many things from happening in our society today. One of the major contributions that this amazing machine would put fourth to the table could prevent mass shootings, that we have in today's society. By setting these facial action coding systems in our schools,banks,government build,e. t. c. to keep inocent citizens safe on the street. If we inplament these facial action coding systems in many of our buildings we can prevent mass shootings from happeinig if the computer analizes that persons charachter. However, the downside to using the facial action coding system is that it can malfunction at ny given time. The facial action coding system seems like a creepy concept but, think about it this device could help our society through many ways other than just preveniting mass shootings . As proffesor Dr. Huang states in the article this machine could tell us how a person is feeling about certain things by using this computer. If we used this state of the art technology today companys and buisness could also use this through marketing so that they know what their customers think of their products and what needs to be done to make their company succede. Besides in today's world we already have facial recognition on most phones how cool would it be for our pones to tell us what mood we are in and what we should do to make ourselves live a happy life. Would the facial action coding system be safe to use? We as a society always want what is best for us and we know that no such product would be released to the product without proper testing and collected data for the next 5 years or more. However, in the near future such technology might exists in many facilities if it doesnt already exist for testing. We all want to know how our friends are feeling when they facetime us and they tell us they are okay but they are really not the facial action coding system can help us by telling us that their is something wrong with them so that we as a good friend can help each other out. The facial action coding system will play a major contribution to our society those who support this project stand up for your beliefs as it is your freedom to support what is good. We need to stop things that can be prevented from happening sucha as suicide help us make a better society and support our foundation to make a better America.",,,,,,,
785,109,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This is very vaulabe and could be great for classrooms. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""then it could be used to modify the lesson, like an affective human constructor."" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" obeserves Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facia; movements-- in a real face or in the painted face by mona lisa. in fact we humans peform this same impressive ""caculation every day. for instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Dr. Huang observes that artists such as Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to covey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da vinci code. we should really give, Facial Action Coding System a chace because ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that,too.""                           ","""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Three reasons right there on why we should switch over to election by popular vote. Unfair, outdated, and irrational. Let's help you better understand; ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all-system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" stated in What's wrong with the electoral college (source 2). The electoral college is also unfair because there's always one person, in this case candidates, trying harder than the other person. Also stated in source 2 ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Which is completely unfair, foolish even. Way past outdated, ""In 1968,"" decades ago. There is no reason as to why we still actually have this around, many people stopped voting, maybe not because of how old this act is, but definetly because we need a new way. Election by popular vote could be one of those new ways. This electoral college has to have an experation date on it someday. Irrational. Irrational because it doesn't make sense, if you think about it, it's basically an easy way to get out of cheating, and no one likes cheaters. If we were to change the election by popular vote, think about how much more worth it would be, think about how there wouldn't be as many problems if people voted for the right candidate. What if they actually won? What about all the world changes? It just makes more sense, it's more reasonable. There could be so many things different today if we changed the way election worked years ago. It's never too late, we still have time. Time to stop the unfair, outdated, and irrational ways. All's you need is a little motivation.    ","What was the hardest decision you ever had to make? Do you ever regret that decision now? Reflecting back, do you wish you could go back in time, and ask someone for advice? When people ask for advice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. First, you get more of a variety of answers, and more opinions. Second, other people will see the situation differently, and they could see it more clearly then you do. Finally, once you talk about this situation that you need advice for, it usually becomes much easier to handle. Would you rather fight a war with soldiers on your side, or face it alone? When you ask more than one person for advice, you get more of a variety of answers, and opinions. Just yesterday, I was asking my mom if I should buy a off-white water bottle, or a pale-blue one, for lacrosse. She said pale-blue, but after I asked her, I asked my friend Generic_Name, and she said off-white, so thats the one I got. We as a world full off homo-sapions are all different, my mom for example is 44, but my friend Generic_Name is the same age as me (13). What I am trying to emphasize here is that, the more different the person is, the more likely you are going to get more of a variety of answers. Asking different kinds of people is important because even though my mom may not be up to date with the current style, she is more mature, and has much more experience. On the other hand, I almost value Generic_Name's opinion more because we are very similar, the same age, and extremely close. Each persons perspective is different, and asking more than one person for advice, could really help you make the right decision. Other people do not think the same way you do, so other people will see the situation differently. Our thoughts are as different, as dogs are to cats. Hypothetically, if you were to ask your friends and family for advice, they would all have different answers for you, and some may see the situation more clearly than you do. You are 75% more likely to choose the right way to handle a situation if you ask people for advice, and talk about it! Even asking someone that is not part of the situation (they are not biased) can help you because they will just say what they think without knowing anyone they are talking about. Always be careful to ask people for advice that you like and trust. Overall, just asking someone for advice can help you a lot because everyone is different, and this could really help you. Once you talk about the situation that you need advice for, it usually becomes much easier to handle. Discussing things can help you make the right decision, and once you talk about it, some of its weight gets taken off of you. That is why you should never keep your feelings bottled inside you. Over the summer last year, my cousin was trying to decide which college to go to, because she had been accepted to many of her top choices. She asked her mom, dad, friends, and myself. She was still very undecided when I talked to her, but we discussed it, and I made a pro and cons chart to help her. After we discussed it, she felt much more relaxed, and made her decision easily. Trust me, I have made too many bad decisions, just because I never talked about it with anyone. In conclusion, when people ask for advice, seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice. Here are the reasons why you should seek multiple opinions: you get more of a variety of answers, and more opinions, other people will see the situation differently, and once you talk about this situation that you need advice for, it usually becomes much easier to handle. Now you've herd me talk for awhile about this, but my question to you is as follows. After hearing all this about asking more than one person and so on, when you think about the hardest decision you had to make, would you go back in time and change it?","Dear Principal, I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service. It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it. To begin children would resent having to do it. They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment. They would just be being forced to do it, so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it, or just hardly do anything. The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose. Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community. Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a good amount that would be interested. All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality. They completely are different. Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community. It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic. All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it. Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves. Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy. If you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do. As students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on. Not only that, is the fact that after school many people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time. At our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities. With already so much work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do. Also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service. People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours. And also tons of students that go to church have to. Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is most middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation. It wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much. Maybe a good idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is. Or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards. Doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of making people do it when they don't want to. Students will have more fun if they have the time and want to. It will have a much better outcome then forcing students. -STUDENT_NAME","Even though there are many perks attributed to them, driverless cars will more than likely cause many more problems than they will solve. They are incapable of responding to accidents that happen to other vehicles, let alone reacting to an accident or a possible accident to themselves. They can have navigation errors or may react to what could be seen as an oncoming car, but it might just be some animal or a harmless object. Even in movies, the driverless cars end up having problems or malfunctioning quite a bit. And even with all the technology put into them, the cars still are not actually driverless. Driverless cars cannot react to an accident like a human could, even thoug ""safety is a big concern,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). A human would swerve out of the way, speed up, or slow down. When something happens, the driverless cars ""alert the driver,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming) so that he or she may take control. In the short amount of time that it would take for the vehicle to alert the driver and for the driver to take control, disaster could be avoided, but due to this lack of reaction time, accidents could be unavoidable. Drivers must be alerted to any accidents that don't even include the car, forcing the driver to take control and navigate his or her self. Driverless cars still require the driver to do a lot of the work. Drivers must take control of their vehicles when ""pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,"" (Driveless Cars Are Coming). Some driverless cars are not even able to drive themselves unless under very specific conditions, such as specially made roads that are designed specifically so that the car may navigate itself. Although the driverless cars are supposed to ""mimic the skill of a human at the wheel,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming), there are many situations, some already listed, that they are unable to do what humans do. Even if driverless cars are mass-produced, they will still have to move alongside many people with normal cars. This could cause a variety of problems and setbacks, as human drivers may not provide the regular pattern that the driverless cars and the roads create. Human spontaneousness may interfere with the driverless cars and their sensors designed to alert the occupant of danger. This may cause a driverless car to swerve or react to some small movement of a car driven by a human, while if a human were driving, they would not have reacted, seeing as well as doing this regularly, they understand that there is no risk or danger to them. Driverless cars will be of little entertainment interest to people. Drivers would ""get bored waiting for their turn to drive,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). If the occupant of the car got bored, he or she might doze off or get distracted. With this distraction, they will take longer to react to the need to take control of the car, if they react at all. Drivers will get bored of driverless cars, quickly reverting back to regular cars, thus causing many companies to lose money due to how much they invested in all the technology required to create the driverless cars. Some people would even buy the vehicles in the first place due to lack of interest. Due to all the money put into the driverless cars, they are going to be very expensive and out of the ordinary worker's price range. With all the technology put into the discovery and creation of driverless cars, there is a going to be an extremely high cost. Sometimes the technologies required to make these vehicles are ""simply too expensive to be practical,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Very few people would be able to afford these cars, so there would be little buyers for the companies. They are using devices that at one point in time ""cost two hundred million dollars,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Companies would end up losing more money than they would gain if they invested in driverless cars. Although many arguments cannot be proven until they are out and on the road in regularity, driverless cars should not be created for normal use. They can cause many problems on the road. They are unsafe and unentertaining to the occupants. They may have navigation issues when faced with and accident or a work zone or some form of traffic diversion. If driverless cars are produced, they may not stay popular for any long period of time.","I think Venus is worth studying because maybe in the future us humans can live in venus. Earth and Venus are close in terms of density and size. Venus still has features that are similar to earth maybe in the future venus can be habitable. Us humans should travel from earth and beyond we can not be limited becasue of the dangers there are out in space. Since Earth and Venus almost have the same density and size i think venus will habitable in a couple of 100's of years just like earth is today. venus is the closest thing we have to Earth. So I think that is why people want to explore Venus. the author even said "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". Like the author says "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"". The author also says "" long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" so why cant venus be habitable ever again? It probabaly will but we have to explore it first becasue we dont know what we can encounter oursleves with in the farther future. Us humans should travel outerspace and look for places where can live if anything ever happenes to earth. We have to think about our future kids, grandsons and theyre children we dont know what the future hold for us and we so we should be prepaired. We cant be limited becasue of how ""dangerous"" it can be out there. If we are scared we""ll never succeed.","Is the face on Mars an alien artifact of just a natural landform? So far we have no real proof that aliens even exist. Also in 1998 the JPL website revealed that it was just a natural landform and not made by aliens. Also NASA would be just as excited to reveal that another life form has been found, that wouldn't be a kept secret. So far we have no real proof that aliens exist. If there were aliens wouldn't we know by now? There are lots of alien conspiracies but nothing that proves aliens exist. UFO spottings are just the same. You may think theres an alien in there but whos to say its not just a flying frisbee. And the crop circles how do you know the farmer doesn't just like to have a nice looking crop. Lots of people believe in aliens but what are they basing these beliefs from, one blurry picture? We can say there may be evidence of aliens but no proof. When the next Mars Global Surveyor flew over we got an even better picture. Lots of people were anxious to find out what the story behind this face was. Later theJPL website revealed something that shocked, relieved, saddened, and angered the people. The website had said that there was no alien artifact just a natural land form. How after all of that can you still think there are aliens? Well some people still believe. There are all kinds of things people think that show us there are aliens. But just about every one of them is some kind of misunderstanding. If we had found aliens we would be eager to share our discovery not try to hide it. People say that NASA is just trying to make us think there are no aliens. The truth is we wish we had found them. It would have been much more exciting to find aliens than some sort of natural landform. Some people think that this is evidence that we are trying to hide our discoveries. I really do wish that we had found aliens. Talk about a pay raise! But, there is still no strong evidence of aliens. I think by now it is safe to say that aliens don't exist. So far we just have no real proof of aliens. Not to mention that JPL already confirmed that the face was just a natural landform. Also theres that part about how we would benifit even more for finding aliens. People can still have their conspiracies but that can't change the facts. THERE ARE NO ALIENS! ",,,,,,,
785,235,"The Facial Action Coding System or FACS, in my opinion could be very helpful and useful in the future. The reason I say this is because, there are many students that get very bored, very unamused, confused and irritated with school work. And if we were able to have The Facial Action Coding System, it could possibly help students get back on track very easily. In the text I read about how The Facial Action Coding System was able to, ""calculate emotions"". And like I said I think this could be very beneficial to students and adults in the Educational Field and the Work Field. For example, in the text it says, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This shows that the FACS is following your mood, so whatever mood you have the following ad will appear. This could be the beginning of participation. In addition, they also say that a classroom computer could detect or recognize when a student is becoming bored, confused, or unamused, according to Dr. Huangs prediction. They also say, ""It could be an effective human instructor."". This could be very effective on students and teachers. I say this because, if a student is bored or confused an ad that pops up could help them realize some things and help put them on track and hopefully get interested. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" according to Dr. Huang. This not only is efficient for students or teachers but, it is also beneficial to Surgeons. This technology is valuable and very useful it seems. The Facial Action Coding System is, a human emotion identifier or detector and this would be very useful to a classroom of students. And others.   ","Dear Mr. Senator, I believe that America should keep the Electoral College to elect the president of the United States. I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guarenteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes (a very convincing number) but only 51.3% of the popular vote (not as convincing). The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301-237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370-168. The pressure of a run-off election is reduced with the Electoral College. The Electoral College gives the big states more representation than the smaller states. For example, Florida has 29 Electoral votes, while a state like Maine only has 4. In 2012, the popular vote was really close in Florida, but Obama won and got 29 electoral votes. If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won,  the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states. The president can't win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a trans-regional appeal. This is desirable for most people because a president that is only popular in one region, and not everywhere will not be a good prsident. This is why candidates don't campaign in places that they know they will win, and branch out to the swing states. These swing states basically decide the election. They are the states that do not favor either the democratic or republican candidate, so they have important votes. If swing states go one way, so will the election. This is why many candidates campaign in these Swing States. As you can see Mr. Senator, the Electoral College is the best way to go for electing a new president. It has a more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote, it gives more representation to the bigger states, and requires appeal from people all over America, not just people in one region.                                  ","Advice is really something you shouldnt take. Advice can we great but the total opposite of what you wanted to hear. People often times give you bad advice as well, so you really should seek out more than one person an opinion on the topic at hand. Seeking multiple persons for advice can often lead you to an overlooked detail ,or a different outcome of the situation. So say one of my friends decided to jump off of a cliff, but they want to know which cliff and how to safely do it. So I told them they shouldn't do it, but someone else told them a specific place and to bring a parachut. Then they ask another person and they also agree that they shouldn't jump off of a cliff. In that senario another person and me convinced my friend not to jump off of a cliff. I also managed to teach him the lesson on getting advice from multiple people, because the same guy who told him to jump off of a specific place with a parachut fell to his death because the parachut didn't catch the air and tangled. Another example of taking advice from oher people would be the ,not so great, explorer Christopher Columbus. He took advice from probably over a thousand people not to set sail, because people knew that the earth was infact round and not flat. Everyone knew that the distance from India from Europe was over thousands of miles, but he didn't listen until the king and queen of Spain said okay on the explorers plans. He was a fool who couldn't do correct math and ended up discovering the Bahamas ,and slautered every native on those islands. If he had just listened to the mass of people trying to stop him from sailing he wouldn't have ""discovered"" the Americas and slaughtered over 30 thousand people. I wanted to write a book about fantasy, but I lacked the creative fuction to put my story on the board. So I contacted my friends and strangers in the streets to ask what I should make my story about. Taking their advice I wrote a million dollar best seller that over took The Hobbit in popularity. All because I asked people what they would've wanted in a fantasy book. The opinions of others might even help me write a book, do something daring, or even just what movie to watch. That is the power of asking others for advice. Advice can often lead to dangerous situations and even not be that great. That is why I should always ask for a second opinion ,and not just go off and do what one person told me. Weither it be an idea for how to start an essay or even what to eat tonight. Advice can be dangerous, but can be exactly what you wanted to hear or the opposite. The opinion of others can make me do wonders i never thought possible.","Dear Principle , I think all students should be required to take community service. Reason being , I think students should have some type of experience in helping our community out. Not only the community but to help the planet out as well. It would help most students who are teens. Because it will most likely keep them out of trouble during there time helping out. It can help them stay on track in school, keep up their grades. And have extra credit. Also help keep them from being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also think it will be a nice experience for those who want to help out. It could also be a fun learning program by having the students learn about their environment and their surroundings. Having students do community service will be a great way of helping save some animal. Animals? You may think. Well yeah animals too. In their own special way. It would help keep all kinds of animals from putting things in their mouths, and help them by decreasing the death rate and health problems that are in the air. I strongly suggest this program. It would also be a nice was of making our school look nice. Not just from the outside but from the inside as well. There for I think you should have all students do some kind of community service to help out. And it can help put more knowledge. Students doing community service might also have an impact on the younger kids by wanting to help keep the environment clean and safe for all people. I strongly recommend this program. I hope this may help change your mind. Thanks for your time and support in having to read my letter. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article that is written by someone who has perspectives on what is good about driverless cars, and what is bad about the cars. After reading this article I believe that the driverless cars are going to be very helpful, and useful to people in the future. I believe that driverless cars will be helpful because the driver will not have to do much work, because the car drives itself 90% of the time. Also in this article the author tell us that the Google driverless cars, can drive up to half a million miles before the car crashes. Driverless cars will also be helpful because the people that were originally driving, do not have to memorize directions anymore. Being a driver requires a lot of attention to the road, and it is hard to pay attention to everything else that is going on around them. With the new driverless car, you do not have to drive the car 90% of the time, which allows for more time to think about other things or make sure that your kids are behaving in the back seats, without having to pay attention to the road. Although 10% of the time you may have to drive, the other 90% you are worry free of driving and can focus on other things that you need to. When people are driving themselves, they tend to be in car accidents very often whether it is severe or not. With the driverless car, you can prevent accidents from happening for a much longer time. Driverless cars have gone up to half a million miles before ever being in a single accident. Going half a million miles without an accident, or the car breaking down is unheard of and nearly impossible, but with the driverless cars, the technology is so outstanding, that the car can go this far. Using a GPS while in a car can be distracting and not safe to the driver, and everyone else that is in the car. Since the driverless car drives for people, now the people in the car can set the GPS and not be distracted by the road. With this feature, the car will always know when the right time to turn is, and will always get you to your destination on time. If you are a person who is late a lot or gets lost all the time, then you might be interested in this car, because it does all of the work for you. Driverless cars are a great idea because they drive 90% of the time, which leaves the driver to be focused on other things, it can drive up to half a million miles before crashing or breaking down, which will make the car owner feel very safe and secure in the car that they own, and also the car takes you where you tell it to because of the GPS system, which can make the owner worry free about getting lost. I believe that this car will be very successful, and it will be the future in the car industry.","The author really makes you feel as if exploring Venus could be safer than taking a trip to the movies. Obviously he points out also that it isn't safe, it's a huge risk that humans would have to take just to achieve knowledge about another planet. The author first explains what Venus is, to prepare readers to further listen on what we would see on Venus. The author says Venus is ""Earth's twin,"" and further supports this with ""it may have well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""It,"" reffering to Venus. The author states Venus has ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" Telling the readers this information makes it seem as if seeing Venus would feel comfortable to us and nothing too out of the ordinary. As ordinary as the author tries to make a trip to Venus seem he doesn't end up leading us in the wrong direction, as he also states the dangers, ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Reading that information makes it seem doubtful humans could ever explore Earth's neighbor. The author goes on to suggest ideas that NASA has pulling the reader back in to believe that it could be promising to think that one day humans can explore Venus. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" That's a lot to take in but the author makes it easy for us to understand the idea by comparing it to ""Jet airplanes traveling higher to fly over many storms."" The author wraps it up by saying ""Venus has value."" He doesn't go deep into the what ""value's"" exploring Venus could have. Only thing he stats is ""insight,"" and ""human curiosity."" The author not going deep into the values is exceptional because that's not what the article was about. The article is more about just progress in space exploration, focusing on Venus. The author then wraps it up with a fair conclusion, including his main point that, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""","Some people think that the face on Mars is really created by aliens. There is some scientifical evidence to this. The real fact is that the face on Mars is just a natural landform. When NSSA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft was in space it took pictures. A few days later NASA unveiled a image. There was a natural landform that looked like a human head, shadows gave the rock some eyes, a noes, and mouth. People began thinking that it was an acutal thing created by aliens. Scientists didn't believed this though. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The team up there snapped picures of the landform again and people were eager to find out the truth about the face. After seeing the picture when it was appeared on a JPL web site people now knew the truth. It is just a landform and not a face created by aliens. It's obvious now, the face is just a naturtal landform. There were no aliens. ",,,,,,,

","I write this to the Senator of Florida. Every four years a president is elected to become what is the Commander and Chief and sole representative of the United States of America. Because we as a country are a democracy, ""the people"" get to choose the president. We go every four years, starting at the age of 18 and so on, to vote or to choose who we want to represent us as Americans. Who we want to run this country. Who we want to lead us both to sucess and trust that they will do all in their power to keep us safe. But are we, the people, really choosing who we want? Just like President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, I believe that we are not choosing at all but we are voting for a state of electors, who in turn choose a president for us. The electoral college is very unfair to voters.""according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore_ thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election...voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidencey. (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid deeefenses of the system are wrong By: Bradford Plumber) If you wanted to vote for a specific president you would have to elect the state electors pledged to that president and hope they pick them. At times the electors have the right idea and other times the electors get confused and choose the wrong person. Other times the elector could even be biased or even racist (in rare cases), and choose the one person that you do not see running this country. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During The 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the cadidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the larrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campain ad."" That is, because the electors are the ones that choose. The candidates don't even attempt to campaign in places they know they wont get a vote on. The cadidates will try to win over the bigger states first to gain more electoral votes to win. I see the electoral college as an unfair way for the people to vote for president. If we are truley a democracy, then we should change from using the electoral college to the use of popular vote, or direct election.    ","Sometimes having to make a decision is pretty hard thats why we ask for advice from some people. Seeking multiple opinions can help with making a better choice because seeing other viewpoints on the topic may help , having other viewpoints can also help with making a decision and lastly, it can help with having the feeling of assurance that you went with the right decision. Making a better choice may sometimes always need the advice of other people, this is because people that need to make a decision want to see other viewpoints on the topic. When having to make a decision its better to see other viewpoints because some people speak from experience to help the person making the choice. Some people give their opinions based off of what they think would be better for yourself and your future. Lastly, some people may give pros and cons of each choice to help the person making the decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice by helping you make a decision . Other opinions can help you choose because if multiple people give the same type of advice on what you should choose you should go with it. Although, you may think what if they're lying or what they say may not be accurate, the most important thing is to go with your gut feeling and if you do have the same opinion or idea as the person your talking with you should always go for it. At times when your not feeling the best connection with the advice you were given you should go with the other choice, there is never a requirement that you have to go with the advice your given when your not feeling it. When getting advice from multiple people its important to keep in mind when decision making because it can influence the decision you want to make. The reason as to why people want multiple opinions on a topic is because they want to have an assurance that whatever advice one person gave you is good and can agree with what someone else was thinking or even yourself. When seeking for multiple opinions we always keep in mind what would be beneficial from making a certain choice. Seeing viewpoints from others, having assurance that advice you are given is good and beneficial, and lastly can help make a decision are all reasons why people seek advice and opinions from multiple people. These reasons are main reasons why most people seek multiple opinions and use to make a choice. ","I think everyone should be required to perform community service. they should support their community and keep it clean all the time like everyone else. It would be rude if they didn't help keep their community clean and safe all the time. If it was me I would love to help my community and country and keep it clean and safe for everyone to live in a clean and safe place. I think the principal should have everyone be required to perform community service everyday to keep the community safe and clean. If nobody kept it clean or safe people would be dead and die all the time. So yeah if I was the principal I would required everyone to help keep are community clean and safe all the time, and i would have everyone pick up trash off the grow everyday until are community in clean. And I would have everyone keep everyone safe everyday until they die.

Can you honestly trust these cars 100%, they have your life in their hands. Even tho in the article it says there is an alert that lets the driver take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with comlicated traffic issues. I still wouldn't trust it, maybe you take advantage of it driving by its self. Then you start doing other things such as texting, playing games on your phone, or looking for something in the back seat. You really trust that car enough to stop paying attention to the road and others around you. So what if something does happen and you crash into something or get into a accident. But the car never alerted you to take over, maybe the technology failed. So now you're injured from trusting a ""driverless car"". That you should of never trusted in the first place, especially with your life. There's no promises that this car isn't gonna mess up or make a mistake. So many things can go wrong with this car, because there is so much technology. Even if the technology doesn't fail, what if there is another driver that is driving reckless. Unfortuately you just so happen to be at the wrong place, at the wrong time. So you get hit by that driver, but will you get warned by the car that the car was even coming. In the article it didn't say anything about the car alerting you when another car is coming at you. These cars can't stop everything from happening, it just might be the cause of something bad happening. The car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to alert the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. What if it doesn't notify you, not all technology is perfect. Almost anything can go wrong, they make you think that it's so perfect with no problems. But that's because they just tell you the positive things about the car and nothing about the negatives. Such as what could happen if the car does mess up or the technology does fail. They're not gonna tell you things like that, because they want you to buy the car. Which you most likely will and you'll trust that car to drive by its self. I wouldn't trust this car one bit, because they're still working on it. So you know for a fact it has problems and could mess in any way, at any point of time. Never let techology take over something that you should be doing everyday. Also that car may not have the driving skills that you have. They say techology can do more than humans, well driving is definately a humans job. Driving shouldn't be handled by technology, because its a everyday thing for humans. we know what to do and how to do it. Technology just could make a mistake and your like is in stake. Because you trusted some technology with your life. What if you do get in an accident in this car, is it the drivers fault or the manuafacturer? Driving is for humans and a human everyday thing, lets keep it that way.","In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" Venus is also known as ""Evening Star"". Venus is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. It is also the second closest planet to Earth,that's why we can see it at night. Mars is also close to us but only at certain times, it all depends on speed otherwise how fast it orbits around us. The atmosphere on Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide which means there's no air, the clouds are made of corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperature is over 800 degrees fehrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, so if we were to send any type if mechanical transportation over there, it would into liquid as soon as it gets there. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other plant in our solar system. Venusian geology says that their are additional impediments the erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes. That means their are multiple natural disasters going on at the same time. Astronomers think that long age, Venus was like our planet (Earth). The planet has a surface of rocky sediment like mountains, craters and valleys. NASA thinks that they could put a blimp or some kind of futuristic jet airplanes in outerspace. In the article, NASA was talking about electronics made of ""silicon carbide"". If NASA could add silicon carbide to a jetplane and some how remote control the aircraft, it might work. I noticed how the author capitalized the ""Venus, NASA, Earth, and all the other planets. Also I saw how the author punctuated and put a comma in between sentences to take a breath when speaking. I liked how he put a lot of detail into what NASA thought they should do. I read how they planned out what kinds of tranportations they could send to Venus. They even tested the conditions with certain matierials and objects.","The Face of Mars The face on Mars has grown popularity over the idea of exterterrestrial life on mars. The face on Mars has many scientists taking sides if the face is exterrterestrial life or is it a rock land formation. Conspiricy theorys are spreading that NASA is hiding something from the public. Why would NASA hide anything about the face if it would fund NASA to grow and explore more, NASA has made 2 trips to identify what the face really is and both trips they ave come to the conclusion that it is a rock, There are few scientists that actually believe that it is exterterrestrial life. Why is NASA being accused of hiding something from the public if they would benefit from discovering something that has to do with exterterrestial life? The Conspiracuy theories are ridiculous and it is completly idiodic to think that people would hide something if they wold benifit from it. NASA has also made 2 trips to prove that it is a rock foramtion on the suface and not exterrterrestrial life. NASA has researched the face and proved that is is a rock formation because it is similar to the land formation here on earth. There are also few scientists that believe the face is exterterrestrial life. The scientists that work for NASA have studied the face and it has been scientifically proven that the face is a rock formation. The face is a rock landform but I could see why NASA would keep it a secret if it wasn't a rock landform. NASA might keep it a secret to avoid mass panic throughout the world, but that is very unlikely that it would be alien life because we have similar land formation to the face on Mars. The conspiricy theorys are ridiculous because NASA wouldnt hide that because it would benefit them and their space program and would earn money to adventure further into space and have better technology.

785,563,"I feel that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not very valuable. Even though I feel that this new way of technology is pretty cool. I don't think that it is something that is really needed in a classroom. In paragraph six Dr Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or boerd,- Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"". This may help the instructor greatly with teaching, and being able to know how their students are feeling. But, I think that as a teacher you should be asking questions, and making sure that the material you are teaching is being understood by all your students. And if it is not, you should find a way to help your students understand. You shouldn't depend on technology when, it is your job to know when the students are becoming boerd or confused. So, that you can make your classroom a better learning environment for everyone in the classroom. Sometimes even though it may not be the best thing to do, students like to keep in their emotion of how they are feeling and don't want the entire classroom to know it. This new way of technology could be a great addition to a classroom for experiments once in awhile, but shouldn't be a major part of the classroom.    ","Dear every state senator of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, the Electoral College has an unfair sysytem. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The citizens of the U.S doesn't have a say in the desicion of whose going to be their countries leader. Hopefully these senators come to realize that it is a fair oppurtunity if citizens also have a say when the desicions are being made. For the good of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America would be an amazing change. To commence with, citizens don't have a say in whose their leader. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" No where in the process of deciding which president should be chosen , does a citizen have a say in who they want. These are citizens who work and give tax money to the state and help the important people like the senators, presidents , vice president etc., they deserve respect and have a chance to be a part of a popular vote for the president of the united states of America. Although having popular vote can still fail to satysify some masses of people , it is a way where everyone could be involved in fair desicions. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" The man said it himself. Bradford Plumer is against having the Electoral system. Hopefully one day state senators of the U.S. and the District of Colombia doesn't fail to realize that their system of voting for the president and vice president are unfair to the Citizens of their country. Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America instead of the electoral college because citizens aren't having a say in any important decisions. Furthermore, desicions may fall into the wrong hands. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.)"" The election is only a few swing voters away from a disaster. What if the house of representatives only has one political party? then does the president who is in that political party always win? There are so many reasons why citizens should have a chance to have vote by direct popular votes, that way descions wont fall into the wrong hands. In conclusion, the state senates should consider making a new sysytem of voting;changing to election by popular votes.                     ","Why if someone needs advice they make a choice to go to multiple people? Is that what you would do? In my opinion I think that going to different people to get advice is good. Your probably wondering why ? Getting advice from different people is good because different opinions could change your mind about something. If you need advice about relationships, friendships , getting along with someone, and or parenting you should go to people who have experienced things the same as you. When you ask one person for advice their advice may not always be the best choice for you but asking people if your option is a good option that could make you feel more positive about your decision. Another good reason for asking many people is because it could lead you to better ways to solve issues. Lets say someone is trying to fight you. Would you want one person to tell you advice about a situation that is very serious like that ? You wouldn't want to take the advice because you are trying to get advice to solve the issue not advice to make the situation even worse than what is already is. If you cant find different friends to talk to maybe you could get different trusted adults to vent to them about somethings thats happening. Advice from different people may impact your life because your going to need advice in life all the time. I think that you can get advice from people can be wrong too but getting bad advice can make you think that your idea wasn't as bad as you thought it would be. This paragraph is going to be about why getting advice from different people can be good and or bad. Getting advice from different people can be bad because some peoples opinions can make a situation bad. It could be bad people the group of people you talk too is trying to set you up to get picked on becuse they dont like you. They might also try and tell you the wrong advce to try and mess the friendships you have up when you and someone are not on good terms. But there are many pros to getting advice from different people. Another good reason is getting advice from other people may want you to help give advice to people when they ask you to help them , or even if you see someone down and they look sad you should give advice and tell them to ask other people because they may not be sure about what you told them. My last paragraph is going to be about talking to people that you trust to get advice. Talking to people about advice is big because what you may need advice about may be something you don't want everyone to know about. If you go people that you already know gives good advice are good people to look up to , not only because they give good advice but also because you know what you are talking to them about is private and you know that they keep things private when it is needed to be . These are my reasons why I think getting advice from different people is important to do. Always get advice from different people","January 26, 2011 Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME, I believe that students should be required to do community service. It will help them learn how to work, teach them responsibility, and help students get into a good college. Community service would help students learn and have experience in working. For example, if somebody liked animals they could volunteer at the animal shelter and they would be able to say, when applying for a job, that they have experience. Also, it will help them learn more about the are they are interested in. Community service will also teach students responsibility. For example, when they make mistakes they will learn to take responsibility for them and to deal with the consequences. Also, it will let them get a feeling of what it is like to have people relying on them and, therefore, putting more responsibility on them. Many colleges look for students who do a lot of community service. Some now have made it a requirement and students will not be able to get into them without it. If the school doesn't provide it, then the students will feel like it is not an obligation and will end up with less choices in college and, ultimately, jobs. I think your school will benefit a lot from adding in a community service program. It will teach them how to work, take responsibility, get them into a good college, and, in the long run, make them better students. Thank you for your time and I hope you will honestly consider putting community service into our school. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","My opinion on driverless cars, i think it would be a stupid idea because i love to drive and im sure there are alot of other people who love to drive. Driverless cars could be a big problem, what if a driverless car had a malfunction and could wreck and kill somebody. Im sure the goverment would disagree with this idea because they love to make money, and all the money to make driverless cars would be outrageous, and that could make the goverment go in dept and it could ruin alot of things. No details support my position because im against it, like i said i love to drive and i wanna be able to go wherever i want in the future and not have to worry about not having my own car because driverless cars just sound stupid. What if these driverless cars have a malfunction and just took off on its own i wanna be able to have my own car and drive on my own, because what if i end p getting a audi gr im sure ill be the one wanting to drive by myself and like i said everyone loves driving so i really dont like the idea. These people who make the driverless cars such as nissan and audi, how do they know they can even make these cars to where it wont wreck on its own, or get us to where we need to go, the only thing i think would be cool about it is if i am tired and im driving and i need to go to sleep and the car could drive on its own, but what if a deer jumped in front of the car and the car is going 60 mph the car isnt just going to stop your going to wreck. If they really wanna make these cars they need to have good protection like a tank or sometin because that would be safe. Im still against it but it would be pretty cool to see what they can really do in the future.      ","The challenge of Exploring Venus... sounds intreseting righ? Heres my summary of the passege.

The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact. The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it. Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform. This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001. This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform. The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face. Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform. When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that. This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform. The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform. Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious. Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too. Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars. This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars. If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform. In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face. The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars. ",,,,,,,
785,923,"Having this type of technology can help people understand others emotions in many ways. It is obvious that this type of technology can not only help others understand students emotions, but possibly help the students who are feeling a certain way. I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. Having technology that can help show how a person is truly feeling is hepful in so many ways. For example, helping a person out who is feeling sad. A student in the classom is normally good at hiding their true emotions or how they are really feeling, but with this technology, a teacher could possibly help this student out once finding out that the student was upset or bothered with something either inside or outside of the classroom. Another way this technology is valuable is by being able to notice when a student is flustered or angry about not understanding a certain part of what they are learning. Not only can this technology determine one emotion, but can determain mixed emotions. This could help a lot when a student in the classroom may not fully understand a topic they are learning but say they understand it completly. Having the chance to use this technology can help students further understand the subject they are on, because the teacher for sure recognizes that the student may not understand it. This also means teachers have more of the oppertunity to help their students out mentally. The use of this technology in classroms is very valubale for many obvious reasons. ","Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College is a unfair system used for voting the reprentative of our nation. Bigger states with a bigger population get more votes, and smaller states get less votes. Its not completely fair, but then again when is politics fair? If the majority of big states are all a certain paty (either democrst or republican) them the entire system is thrown off, unfair, and unbalanced. Its much more fair if the people of the United States vote amd the votes were to be counted as individuals and not grouped to see which has the greater percentage and then given a certain number of votes to that party's candidate. Although the process I think will be fair does include greater numbers, the government has equipment such as computers to do the counting for each person. This system is rigged and unjust. It is the opposite of what America and its foundation is all about - equality. I would like yout to take this to washington and even if you get scrutinized and pestered, you should ride forth because lots of Americans think this system is corrupt and if we want our voices and opinions to be heard there is no one else we can tell but you. So represent us small town people of LOCATION_NAME, represent the nation in undergoing a process that will finally make our country one of equality. Sincerely, GENERIC_NAME    ","When people want to ask for ideas or advice, they sometimes go ask more than one person. Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person. If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea. If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions. In my opinion asking more people is better because i get multiple opinions to help[ me make a better choice. If you feel comfortable asking just one person then do it, but having multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. So lets say you want to get advice on how to get a girlfriend. You go to your best friends house and ask him, hey whats some advice or tips on getting a girlfriend and he gives you some advice and tips. Then you go and ask your parents, elders, teachers, and more friends and they all give you a bunch of ideas and opinions on how to get a girlfriend. Those are my thought on why its better to ask more people than just one person.","Dear Principal, I am all for community service. If students are required to do different services we will become a better community. Say, if 10 students pick up garbage around the community each day it will become cleaner. If we have students to tutor the younger children in elementary, we are sure to see there grades and scores change. Also, for them to do better in school. I can also see how some students would not want to do this. Some students are dedicated to sports or clubs. Which means that they have school then practice/ meetings right after. Once they get home they have to do all there homework or study for a test. Understanding they have chores and other stuff to do at home. Some students do not have a lot of time at all. If you really want us to help out our community you could make it a extra class for college credits or bonus for a class. Doing this would make students want to help out a lot more. It's a win, win situation. The community is becoming cleaner and more joined as a whole. While students are earning better grades and getting credits for college. As you can see, our community and students can gain from this. It's just how we reward the students for there service. Of course, if you help them out with college or to get better grades they are going to want to do it. On the other hand if you don't reward them with anything, fewer students are going to want to help out the community. I am thinking this could really work. I really hope you take into consideration my views on the issue. I am hoping to see the community change for the better. Not the worst. Thank you for all of your time!","After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I developed my own opinion on driverless cars. My opinion on driverless cars is that I agree with the development of driverless cars, because it seems like a good idea and I believe that they are something that people would want to buy. The article features plenty of information to support my claim including why driverless cars are a good idea and how they will help us in our everyday lives. The first piece of evidence in favor of driverless cars comes from the information that ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" The fact that Google has been working on driverless cars for so long proves that driverless cars are a good idea. This is because if Google has been working on this technology for the past seven years then that means that they have been constantly improving their product and that it is pretty far into it's development period. That means that the cars are able to be manufactored pretty well at this point even if they're not perfect, which helps to prove that with that much work done on it the cars have many improvements from the original product and will be easier to manufactor and sell in the future. Computer-driven cars have been in production or at least an idea in some of the major car companies minds since as early as the 1950s. Sensors that use computer information to stop or control the car have been worked on since the 1980s. Since driverless cars or computer-driven cars have been an idea for so long then it means that they probably will continue to remain an idea that companies will try and harness. If the idea and development related to the idea has been going on since the 1950s there is almost not doubt that it will not stop being studied and developed. If it can last sixty years, then it probably will not disappear anytime soon. Driverless cars are here to stay. Driverless cars also show the ability to assess the situation therefore giving them a better chance of being able to stop accidents before they happen. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accident."" The ability to assess the situation and inform the driver is a very important feature. This may also be helpful in preventing car accidents and the injurys or deathes that occur from them. Since the driverless car has safety precautions it makes it a good choice for on the road and proving once again that development for these cars should continue. Four states have already approved the limited use of driverless cars. ""California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have lead the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars."" This information helps to prove that the idea that the idea of driverless cars is slowly but surely being accepted. California and Florida are large states that have a large population and get a lot of tourists every year. Nevada contains Los Vegas, another huge city, and is a place where a lot of people got to gamble. Finally the District of Columbia houses some of the most important buildings and artifacts of the American government. These are all states that mean a big deal, and since they have accepted driverless cars that means that they could spread extremely quickly to the other states. If some of the biggest most populated and most important states can accept the cars then that means that the bettle is almost won and is proof that driverless cars are a good idea. Most car companies are jumping on the bandwagon and are beginning to work on making driverless cars. The ones that are mentioned expect to have driverless cars avaible in the next five years. Large scale car companies like Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan are all planning on releasing cars. This means that those large scale companies have realized that driverless cars are a good idea and they do not want to miss out. Those mass producers usually do not plan on manufactoring something unless they believe it will make a decent profit. By saying that they are going to work on these cars these companies are saying that they believe that driverless cars happen to be something that they believe a lot of consumers will want to buy. This proves that driverless cars are a good idea because it means that people are interested in them and believe that they are a good idea.","Venus is possibly the closest to Earth in size and density then and other planet. Which, makes you belive that just maybe, us humans can live on Venus just as we do live on Earth. Even tho Venus is very similar to our Earth it is very different. For example, Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Even the surface is affected and can average 800 degrees Farenheit. Even though these conditons are too extreme for our human kind. We can possibly create something or discover something greater that can withstand all of those extreme enviorments. Earth has an abundant of shapes and sizes of clouds. Not only do we have clouds that not only look beautiful, we also tend to have clouds that can harm us. Between a mixture of fog and rain it creates smog,which, can harm our skin. Not only does Earth have clouds, Venus does too. But Venus has clouds that can potentially kill all of human kind or melt through many types of metal. Venus has these very high corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in the atmosphere that would be a big problem for us humans to explore Venus. In conclusion, all of these conditions on Venus doesnt have to be as problem as long as we can create or discover something to counteract the conditions. The author believes there is a way for us humans to finally study Venus and possibly make it capable for us humans to live. Earth changed through time and so have humans. Our technology has greatly increased from when we first started to live on earth. If we try hard enough to fulfil a great cause that will benefit us in the future we can possibly start something new. ","I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because they even had pictures that proved that is was a natural landform. Many people in the world had their own personal claims about the Face, but scientifically, it had been proven by pictures otherwise. Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and captured pictures of the Face with a ten times better camera than the original Viking photos that were taken before. In the article, the text says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Even cameras caught the landform with pictures and proved it. The text also states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" According to this piece of informational text from the article, the Face is a massive, natural landform, just like any landform here on Earth. In this article, it has been proven by NASA and detailed pictures of the Facee, that it's just a natural landform that just so happened to look like a human face. Even though some had their own thoughts and opinions, scientifically, they were wrong. ",,,,,,,
416,109,"When asking for you people may ask more than one person because, if multiple people are asked the same question, and everyone has the same, or similar answers then, the person seeking advice is less likely to be wrong on the decision they need advice on. If when you ask multiple people for advice and everyone gives you a different answer then you have options, and even tho, the more options you have, the grater your chance of being wrong about what you need advice for is, it gives you the final voice in the subject on whose advice to take. You may now be thinking that you having the final voice in the decision defeats the purpose of advice, but it doesnt. When you have the final voice in a decision you then have to way your options very carefully, and you actually grow smarter and learn from the decision made, as oppose to just going along with whatever everyone else dose. For example if you are going to college and twelve elite colleges have accepted your application, then which one to go to. So now your stuck on which school to go to, there all really good schools to go to and all have a great department for what you want to major and minor in so which one? You eventually decide to ask some of your friends and they all say that elite school number one is the best and you should definitely go to that one, and you were already on the verge of going to elite school number one so why not, but just to be sure that elite school number one is the best school you ask your family. All your direct family thinks it's best to go to elite school number two. so now you have a choice between the two best schools in America. You decide to gather more data and then realize that you havent considered what you want, you have been thinking about what other people would do and you promptly pick elite school number two and learn that you need to consider your self two and learn your lesson. from that example it shows what would be going through a senior's mind when they pick there school, and proves how you can learn when a decision isnt given As I have proven seeking multiple is opinions mostly a good thing and normally leads to the best possible outcome. While relying on other people to help you with a decision is OK other people can't make decisions for you. Sometimes going with the crowd can be a good thing, it can also be bad so your own opinion needs to be seen too. when you have multiple choices your own opinion matters even more than, opposing the crowd. If you ever need advice it is always good to get more than one persons opinion on a matter especially if it is important. That is why people ask multiple people for advice.","Reisdents of VAUBAN that are car owners are allowed to park in two places in a large garage. alos at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. some of the citizens where not to happy about the plan of having no car almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to reuters 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. At the Mobile World conress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chir man of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a bsiness plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. he proposed partnering with the telecommunications inustry to create cities in which pedestian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportaion traffic are woven into a cconneted network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety. Levittown and Scarsdale, Newy York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of thw 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.                                                                    ","Have you ever had to do a required summer-reading project? Most schools require students to read a book and write a paper or present a project on it. These projects take a lot of time from our summer break. But what if I told you that you can choose your own project topics and ideas? Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can choose a topic that they are actually interested in, get creative with their own ideas, and have fun while doing it. To start things off, these projects would be better if they were student-designed because the students would choose topics that they are actually interested in. Nobody wants to spend their summer break reading and writing a report. If the students got the chance to write or present about something that they are interested in, then everyone would have fun and the chances of everyone doing the project on time are higher. There are so many different things that they could talk about, for example, an activity they did that summer, stories about the places they have traveled to, a sport they played or are getting ready to play. The possiblities are endless and the students will want to do the project. You will not have to worry about anyone cheating or presenting the same thing over and over again. 9 times out of 10, a student will forget to do their project until last minute and text their classmates, ""Hey which book did you read? Did you write the paper? Can I see it?"" They will not do the project on their own and it will not benefit them in the slightest. Not only would they be more interested in it, but they will also be more creative because it will be about something they care about. It will benefit everyone more if the projects were student-designed. Speaking of getting creative with their projects, students are more likely to create something different if it is about a topic they care about. If all students are forced to read the same book, they will all write about the same thing and could potentially cheat. Now if the students were to choose what they were going to write about on their own, they will allow more ideas to flow. Back on the students choosing topics such as what they did over the summer and sports they play, you will see different projects and read different papers because not everyone does the same things. You could read about a trip to an island or going hiking on a rocky trail or going to an amusement park. It is very unlikely that students did the exact same thing. Students have a very vivid imagination and can be creative all the time. But if you tell a student to sit down for an hour, read a book, and then write a paper, nothing will happen. ""You have to let the juices of the young mind flow and let the ideas come together,"" quote from Generic_Name, a teacher's assistant. She believes that forcing students to exactly what you want will leave you disappointed. You will see true progression and growth in letting them do their own thing. Some may say that if students are not told exactly what to do, then they will be lost or confused. These same people also say that without someone constantly reminding them of what to do, that they will soon forget and fail. It is understandable for adults and our teachers to believe that students do not care about school or push every assignment to last minute as if we did not remember to do it or just did not want to. Despite these reasons, students will choose to do the work if it is fun and benefical to them. If they were allowed to choose and design their own projects, they would be receiving a grade for having fun and discussing something that they enjoy. All school year long, we sit in classrooms and are forced to learn things that we do not care about and that will not help us with adult life. We do not want to spend our summer doing that exact same thing. Personally, as a student, designing our own projects about something we are delighted by would be an amazing opportunity. There will be no excuse on why a student did not do it or did not have it finished because it is a whole porject based on you and your interests. Undoubtedly, we should design our own projects and create our own ideas. In conclusion, students should be able to design their own projects so that they can choose a topic that they are actually interested in, get creative with their own ideas, and have fun while doing it. Students need to be able to use their imagination in school. If you got to design your own project, what would your topic be?","I think that community service is a great way to keep our city strong, clean and organized but when it is assinghed to people for legal punishment it gives people the wrong idea about it, For an example if your riding your bike and you noticed some prisoners on the high way picking up trash would you want to do that no because it gives people the wrong mind set about it making them think that its a horrible job to be picked to do. To make some one do something is to make them hate it, to incourage some one to do some thing is to make a posibility. community service shouldn't be about punishment it should be about helping out without getting money or rewarded, because in the end it helps us all financualy and community wise but offcourse you don't have people jumping up and down for it and because of the simple fact as its not looked as helping out our community its looked as a singh of punishment and allways have been. people have no problem avoiding something especialy when it comes to work. so why not try to explain how it will help us and benefit our needs for the future. If more people recycle their would be less pollution in our atmosphere and we wouldent have to make as many things as we do over and over like plastic bottles. and paper,because paper comes from trees just like our oxygen which is very important if we keep cutting down trees we wont hsve any air, which is how we breath.","dear principle, If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy i think the best idea is to choose policy one. Policy one is the better choice to pick, not only is it more favored by the rest of the students, but it gives the students responsibility. Also policy two is a bad choice, not giving the students the right to have their cell phones is wrong when almost all of them has one. A rule like this is easy to break and many students will get into trouble. If you make it a rule that students can not have their cell phones at all, the students will bring them anyway and if they are already breaking a rule by just having them, most of them will break more of the rules and start using the cell phones. Policy two, i think, is a horrible choice. Policy one however, is an excellent choice. Students will be happy that they can have their cell phones and be able to use them in the time given.","Venus is a place that all scientists these days are completely interested in. The reason why they are so into Venus is because first off, how Venus is called ""Our Sister Planet"" which means that Venus has some similar living conditions as Earth does. For example, Venus was origionally filled with mostly oceans that could've supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet according to the article used to or still has familiar features such as Valleys, mountains, and even living/moving creatures. Which makes Venus sound like it was origionally Earth, but you'd be worng there, because Venus has extreme weather conditions such as temperature getting up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, or the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more greater than what we experience on Earth. This is my story. Venus is an interesting planet that scientists have been studying for generations on generations. With the information I gave from the article above would bafle any person in the world. A claim that I'm about to tell you will support the author of this article's idea that we should look more into Venus. For example, the information I gave above in the intro are some reasons why we should look into it more. Another reason why scientists should look at Venus more is, because even though it had all of those similar living conditions as Earth has, there's some drastic conditions that'll still make it non-livable. Some things that'll make a difference is Venus' weather conditions, Temperature is at an average of 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Another is because the air pressure would be at the same amount Earths Ocean's are at, which is not livable at all. And another example is that Venus has extreme thunder/ lightning and rainstorms which frequently hit the ground and would cause a lot of fires. My final thoughts on this topic is we should study Venus because even though the thing I'm going to give as an example is not on the article. We should study Venus a lot more because, Venus used to or still does have some of the same living conditions, but when the planet has storms or has other negative issues, the planet Venus can get extremely violent naturally. And their weather conditions compared to ours on Earth are drastic, and make our hurricanes or other form of a storm that we think is terrible and powerful (which they are), will make us and Earth feel incredibly weak.","Dear state senator, In reference to our state we would prefer keeping the electoral college instead of abolishing it. Under the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated three electors and treated like a state for pupose of the Electoral college. If you take this away, there will be anarchy all around us, and I assure you that you dont want this to happen. The electoral college is a right for us, and it lets us know that we have a right, and a say in this country. It would be wrong to take that away from us. What have Richard nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob dole, and the AFL-CIO all, in their own time, agreed on? They all agreed on abolishing the electoral college. And they are not the only one's who have said it. According to the gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral collge, won the popular vote but lost because of the 60% of his voters prefered a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. I urge you to please consider your peoples feelings on this matter and consider not abolishing the electoral college. Sincerly, a concerned citizen.            ",,,,,,,
416,235,"If you are struggling to figure out what to wear to an important job interview, would you rather ask for advice from a single person or multiple people? The obvious answer is to ask for multiple peoples advice to receive more people inputs and opinions on the decision. The outcome of a dilemma is normally benevolent if you seek multiple opinions because there will be many diverse opinions provided, there is a higher chance that at least one of the people you talk to have been in your position, and by talking to more then one person you can tell if the person giving advice has positive motives for helping you. Firstly only asking for advice from one person is only going to allow you to achieve a narrow minded thought process. You will only be thinking about one possible solution, blind to the fact that there are endless possibilities. People all have different perspectives, experiences and beliefs, meaning that they all have different ways of examining a problem and looking for a solution. So if you take advice from a variety of people they may be able to notice possibilities you had not even thought about. I have been in a situation where I was trying to save up money for my sister's birthday. I thought that I would never be able to save up enough money for her gift, but after asking for advice from my parents and other siblings by putting all of there ideas together I was able to think of a solution to save enough money for my sisters gift. Also by increasing the amount of people you ask advice from, the chance of talking to someone who has been in a similar position to you increases. This can help them find an easier way to help you since they already have an understanding of your position. They may be able to use their own solution, from there experiences, and adapt it to your situation to help you make better decisions. Therefore giving you much more useful advice then if you were to come up with a solution without someone who understands your position. Lastly there is a possibility that if you only ask one person for advice they may purposefully give awful advice for their own selfish maleficent reasons. They may also try to take advantage of the fact that you are going to be influenced by the advice they give you, and make you have doubts about what you are doing is wrong. There have been moments in my life where I have seen people try to sabotage my chances by giving me terrible opinions. But by asking for multiple peoples opinion I was able to weed out the unhelpful advice. In conclusion by asking for advice from multiple people the chances of you making better choices will increase. The result of a dilemma is normally benevolent if you seek multiple opinions because there will be many positions given to you, there is a higher chance that one of the people have been in your situation and by talking to more then one person you can make sure the person giving advice doesnt have any hidden intentions. These are all reasons on why taking advice from several people can have a better outcome on your decision.","Limited car use has dramatically reduced the amount of enviromental toxins in the air in some cities. Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia have banned car use for a day and have seen the air clean up just because very few cars were being driven. One community in Germany even banned the use of cars in general. The enviroment is in dire need of help and we can help it. If everyone took one day out of the week where we did not drive anywhere and on the other six days we drove as little as possible and carpooled the air would be so much cleaner. Not driving also has added health benefits, walking or biking everywhere is a good way to excersise. A new kind of suburb has been created in Germany where cars are not allowed. There are a few roads on the perimeter of the city that allow cars to be driven but besides that residents walk or bike everywhere. There is little pollution in the air and residents are able to take a tram into neighboring cities. Seventy percent of families do not have a car and fifty-seven percent of families sold their car to live in this community. If you own a car in this community you can buy a parking spot for forty thousand dollars. One resident, Heidrum Walter, said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier that way."" Lack of cars also gives parents peace of mind, cars are still dangerous machines and in this community their kids can play without their parents worrying about them getting involved in an accident. Paris' pollution rates have been rising over the years and hit almost record level highs for a few days, so in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air there was a temporary car ban. One day anyone who has a even-number license plate was not allowed to drive. If you were caught driving you had to pay a fine that is equalivant to thirty-one U.S. dollars. The smog miraculosly cleared up quickly and people were able to drive again. Another city in Columbia, Bogota, holds a ""Day Without Cars"", once a year. Citizens are allowed to use public buses and taxis during this day. The government is trying to advocate for public transportation and smog reduction. Most people walk on this day and even though it has rained on this day before citizens participated just the same. When you choose to walk or bike everywhere it not only makes an impact on the enviroment but it also reduces your risks for dieseases like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Obesity rates in America are a lot higher than they should be and that's partially due to lack of physical activity. By walking or biking to work or to school you reduce that risk because your heart rate is up and your body is moving. Of course if people stop driving obesity will still exist due to our horrible eating habits but it would help a lot. If there was less driving it would also be beneficial to our health because we would be breathing cleaner air. The air we breathe is often times highly polluted and if there was less cars not as many deadly chemicals would be in the air. There would still be cigarette smoke and factory pollution but it would be dramatically less. If people in America reduced their driving time it would be better for the air and better for us. Many other cities have proposed an annual day without cars so I think cities in America should start doing it. We only have one world and although we have done a pretty horrible job of taking care of it, that does not mean we can't attempt to fix the mess we made.    ","If there was projects over the summer, They should be constructively divided between the Teachers and Students, because there would be more creativity and fun for the projects. If you let either side take full or majority of the planning and development, it could be least interesting to either side. Lets say the teachers come up with a boring Science project to do over the Summer with a bunch of Worksheets, the students will not enjoy that. That being said the Teachers most likely don't want to grade too much work , they would prefer it to be simple and fun. Depending on age and grades, I believe grades 6+ should have students and teachers create projects and Ideas , It'd also allow the teachers and students bond a little more and help them with other school activities. Grades 5 and under should have summer projects but have more creative teachers in the role, considering the students are still very young. If you start giving students projects when they are younger they could develop and already learn those skills needed for projects and school work. Different schools, counties, and states can differ on such school activities. For most Schools and Counties they should be possible to do these projects it just needs a combined effort from both the Students and Teachers.","To the editor: In my personal opinion I believe we should all take part in cleaning our community for a better future but we both know how persistent someone can be. Perhaps we should create a virtual simulation of what Earth will look like if we continue to destroy it. Let me reassure you it won't be pretty. Maybe this will give them motive because they don't want to live in filth. After doing so we can convey how much of a difference little things make for example: when you throw something in the water it's eventually going to end up in the ocean. Imagine what a water fall would look like if it were overflowing with garbage. You might want to offer something such like five extra minutes to break as well. Something so petty to you like five more minutes could be the difference that changes it all. This will clean our community, motivate a lot of people, and get students to participate in physical activity. It should also build good work ethics, and teamwork skills. Which will reflect on class work and the fighting ratio could possibly drop due to the fact that students will be much more prone to resolve an issue with words rather than to have conflict since they have been working together.      ","so the question is, should we allow students at school to have cell phones. in my complete and honest opinion, i think it is a great idea. cell phones are a wonderful way to talk to friends during lunch without having to walk across the lunch room. they can also provide as a good resource for kids during free time that need help with assignments, seeing that most phones have wi-fi connect ability. and even if they cant connect with the internet, you could just text a good friend of yours. another good reason to have the phone is so when a student isn't feeling well, the teacher could give the child permission to text his or her mom/dad to bring them some medicine or to go home. on thing that we need to realize is that we are growing as a country culturally as well as technologically. as a school and a country we need to embraces technology. it is estimated that by 2015 all schools will have switched over to e-readers. if technology is moving that fast, why not go with the flow of things and allow thing like cell phones at school. all in all, i think that it would be a great idea to let children have cellular devices at school, it would be a time saving effort for not only the students but the teachers as well. this is why i think we should adopt policy 1.","Exploring Venus would not be an easy task, as mentioned by the author of this article, but the author believes that studing Venus is worth the dangers it presents. The author lists some reasons for studying the planet and many reasons why it would be dificult. Venus is a very forboding place that is not kind to the human race. The author lists some reasons why Venus is hard to study, such as: the atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds are of corrosive sulfric acid. The carbon dioxide atmosphere makes the pressure put on the surface 90 times greater than what is on Earth. The sulfric acid can eat throught many metals over time and will constantly erode anything we send there. The surface tempature of Venus is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is hot enough to melt tin. The author also give some reasons why we should try to visit Venus. One is that Venus may have been like earth long ago. Venus once had large liquid oceans that could of supported life forms, and it has many geological similarities to Earth such as the surface being rocky, sediment buiding up, mountians, and creaters. Venus is also the closest planet at times and could be crucial to space travel as a stop along the way. Many new technologies would come from trying to visit Venus. Some listed by the author are simplified electronics made out of silicon carbide, these components have been able to survive for three weeks in similar conditions to the surface of Venus. Another technology would be bringing back mechanical computers used in World War II and repourpose, and advance them. Mechanical computers may last longer int he harsh conditions, but lack the speed needed for complex computations. The author gives several reasons why trying to study Venus would be benifical and backs up their claims with sufficent evidence. The author also gives several counter claims to let readers see the other side of the debate and lets them choose. Technology is another thing listed that dosn't have a whole lot to do with the debate but is more of a positive by product, so that could also be a reason why we should visit. Overall the author does a exceptional job in argurig why we should try to study Venus even if it is difficult, the human race will prosper.","The Elector College should be abolished because of it's many flaws that it has. First and foremost, presidential elction is not about the people. In the article named, ""The Indefensible Electoral college:Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" it talks about how the people don't get to vote for the president. The article says,""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not fot the president, but for a slate of eletors, who in turn elect the president."" This is mostly unfair, the people should get to decide whether whom their president might be not some electoral chosen by the politacl party or precidency campaigns. This law deosnt follow the ways of the constitution even though it was established by the founding fathers. It's very absurd because, the consitution starts with, ""We the people"" and in this case the people so to speak, dont get to vote for their own president. There is no reason why electorals are the ones who's vote count on  the election because they dont have the minor idea of what the people want. In addition to that, if the people vote for the candidate's electors, how do the people know that the electors are voting for the running candidate they won? Well they simply don't. Stated in Source 2 under ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" it talks about how electors vote for whom which ever candidate they want. The article says,""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? sometimes."" If the electors are the ones choosing who the next president is going to be, then there is no reason why the people are voting if their votes don't count. The people are not able to decide whom their next president is going to be. Moreover, who are these so called electors? Stated in source 2 under ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" it talks about whom the electors are. The article says "" Back in 1960, segragationistsin the Louisiana legislature nearly succeede in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jonh F. Kennedy. In the same vein,""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for thier party""s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...""Basically what they are saying hear is that the electoral are random people who actual vote counts instead of yours'. Does that sound correct to you? Normal people from around your class or any get actual count on their vote, what happened to, ""All men are created equal"". Congress is letting other people decide for you, nobody else but you knows what your decisons in society are. Not even electors ,A.K.A randon beings. As said before this goes against what our founding fathers would actually want that is why it should be abolished. Secondly, the Electoral college has caused various problems in previous history before. In source 2 it talks about how congress made an error. The article says"" Whaqt is a state sends two staes of electors to congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, Validated only his oppenet's electors, but he made sure to do so..."" doesnt that seem a bit fishy to you. He validated the other candidates elector votes, why not his? Congress has been cheating us with this law. It has been controlling and deciding who maybe in power. Furthermore, in the same article it talks about how the electoral college system focuses on a winner take all system. The article says,"" Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states...""you see how on fair this law is? It doesnt even acknowlege small states to vote not even the electors. There is nothing fair about this act and I demned for it to be abolisehd. In conclusin the electoral college act is ufair and has caused for election to be a hassle. And only that but ""We the people"" and ""All men are created equal"" does not count in this law. so yeah, most devinetly it should be abolished.                        ",,,,,,,
416,494,"When asking people for advice, usually asking a close friend or a trusted adult is what first comes to mind. In some cases, More than one person needs to be asked. When advice is needed asking more than one person can be better than just asking one. In the event that advice is needed, asking two or maybe even three people can be a lot more reassuring. New ideas are brought to the table meaning more options to choose from when the decision needs to be made. As an example, Generic_Name might not know what to do when the school bully tells him to meet him after school on the blacktop to fight. Generic_Name asks his friend what to do and his friend has the same idea as him. Asking two or three people might give new or maybe even better ideas than the one that he thought of. So now Generic_Name is avoiding the fight, and is safe because his other friends told him to tell the principal. Asking more than one person might also add to your idea. For an example, Generic_Name wants salad but doesn't know what to put on it. He puts the lettuce shredded cheese and ham on it but he knows he's missing something. He asks his friends to see what they say. One friend asks if he has put tomatoes on it, and another asks if he put croutons on it yet. so with these new ideas at hand, he can now add these items to his salad, and has a salad ready for lunch tomorrow. Making better decisions is another outcome for asking multiple people for advice. As an example, Generic_Name is at the shoe store looking for some new shoes for school. He is trying to get the newest pairs of Jordans' because he wanted to be the first at his school to have them, but they are way too expensive. On the other hand, he could get a much cheaper pair of Air Force Ones but then he would look like everyone else. Generic_Name is really indecisive, so he calls his friend to see what he says. his friend tells him to buy the Jordan but they are too expensive. Generic_Name then asks his dad, and his dad says the Air Force Ones are much more affordable and look good too. Generic_Name not knowing what to do suddenly remembers that basketball season is coming up, and the only pair of basketball shoes are beaten up and dirty. Generic_Name then asks one of the employees that work there is they have any basketball shoes. The employee directs him to the basketball section and Generic_Name sees the basketball shoes hes been wanting, and at an affordable price. There are times when you need some advice, and a lot of it. Asking more than one person is better in many different ways. Some for making better decisions, and some just to hear the opinions of others and what they think is the best thing to do. Someone once said, "" two heads are better than one"".","There is a new era in driving. people from all around the contry are either cutting down on driving or getting rid of there cars all together. I think that cutting back on te usage of driving a car will get people to find new ways of travel and also cut down on green house gas emisions. There are many reasons to cut down on the driving of cars. one of these reasons is to find new ways of traveling. I'm not the only one who feels this way. there are many up and coming communitys enforcing the same idea but actual doing somthing to enforce it. ""70 percent of vauban's families don not own cars and 57 percent of the familys sold there car to move there""(source 1)as you can see i am not the onlyone with these belifs this neighborhood has set up certin rules and restrictions to make sure that people are either finding a place to store there car and walk and find a new means of transportation or they are selling there cars all togehter. Another way people like this are preventing people from driving or buying cars is they make it extremly expensive to park and store your car. like it says in source 1""car ownership is alwoud but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development where car owners buy a space for 40,000 dollers,along with a home""so as you can see even though they are not making driving imposable but they are making it extremly hard to induldge in that process. Another reason that i think we should cut down or completly get rid of driving and cas is to cut down on green house gas emisions. in the second scource it says ""paris had 147 micrograms of particulate mater or PM. compared to other contries in the world that only have 114 or 79 micrograms PM."" (source 2) this goes to show that just one of the smaller cities in a smaller contrie is emitting this much pollution into the air imagine how much the U.S is or china is emitting daily. when paris found out abot this they made sure that no one was driving for the next few days to ""clear the air"". and when the driving ban lifted there was already an increase in the clenleness of the air after only a few days of not a lot of people driving. And the people who were caught driving were givin a fine for driving. if we want to stop the green house gas emisions we as a contry and even a world need to find ways like what paris did to ""clear the air"" cars alone make up 12% of the green house gas emisions. now imagine our contry and planet if we were to completly cut out that 12% percent. we can do that as long as we can come up with ways and guide lines and rules to limit the use of cars. to wrap up,i think as a contry and as a planet we need to come up with new ways and ideas on how to limit the use of cars and the green house gas emisions. and the only way to do that is to give people other options on diffrent ways of travel and to show them the statistics of how bad cars actualy are for the enviroment.                                                    ","Should summer projects be teacher or student designed? Doing projects over the summer are great for memory. Are also fun to do because it is a hands on activity to do over the summer. Learning and understanding are reasons on why teacher-designs are great fro summer projects. One reason, on why teacher-designs are great for summer projects is learning. Learning from the teacher's design over the summer is best because going into a new school year will help when going over the topic. Another example, on why learning from the teacher's design over the summer is perfect fro what the teacher wants you to talk about over summer break. Their is another reason on why a teachers design is better. Another reason, on why teacher-designs are great for summer projects is understanding it. Understanding the teacher's example is perfect for making your own. The reason why the teacher's give out an example is to understand the layout of what they want you to do. Some people would argue over why a students design is better. Some people would say that, doing a student- designed project over the summer is better because it's easier to understand. The teacher's design is better than the student design because it gives a layout on what the student needs to do and put on their project. In conclusion, learning and understanding are reasons why teacher's give out their own design for students over the summer. If I had a project over the summer I would use the teachers- design to help me out.","Dear Principal, I firmly believe that all students should be required to perform community service. The act of serving others helps individuals learn how to be compassionate, caring, and better citizens. Many students already, have contributed to the community by tutoring elementary students and participating in local trash clean-ups. However, some students believe that community service is a waste of time. So, I am going to inform you that it is not. Tutoring younger students is an example of community service that helps people, other than ourselves. It helps younger students with their homework or questions, and it provides a role model in their life. If a younger student was taught by a person they looked up to then, when that child grew up, they could do the same. They would tutor younger kids just like their role model. This is a positive act, because, their would me more educated kids in our community. Another community service is trash clean-ups. They may not sound like fun, but they help keep the community clean and beautiful. If more kids in our school picked up a piece of trash in our school or the whole community, the world would be a little cleaner. Cleaning is not that hard either, but kids have to be motivated and with the requirement of community service, they would be. This whole letter is to try to convince you to try to make that requirement of community service, but it wouldn't be fair if i only showed you one side of the story. A lot of kids would rather be playing video games or watching t. v. in their spare time, but community service does not take a lot of time. Picking up trash in the halls in between classes , or answering a question is considered community service. It only takes a minute! If you make community service a requirement then, we would see more good deeds every day. The community would be a better place and we students, will become better everyday citizens.","Dear, principal I think kids should be allowed to bring them to school and use them during lunch and passing periods because if they have a problem in or outside of school they would have a cell phone to call 911 for example if their walking home and they see a fire they would be able to call 911. And if they would have some free time to text during lunch maybe they wouldn't text during class. Incase of an emergency student could actually save some ones life for example there's two kids in the lunch room and one of them starts to choke and the other one could call 911. And after lunch period their cell phones would be off and the teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids texting in class. There is a million reason why kids should have their cell phones at school i just can't name them all. this is why i think kids should bring and have their cell phones at school.      ","The author does a really good job with explaining in great detail as to why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. There are many dangers to this such as how hot and how unearth-like Venus really is today, but Venus used to be just like earth with many oceans and sea like creatures that we have on earth as well. ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occassionally the closest in distance too."" (paragraph 2) He then goes on to explain how Earth is sometimes ""right around the corner"" from Venus and because of this we have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus. Since no aircraft would be able to last over a few hours, no man has ever been in these spacecrafts that get sent there. Scientists are discussing further visits to Venus because they are fascinated with how much Venus used to be like Earth. ""Long-ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" *(paragraph 4). Scientists have discovered that to this day Venus still has many of thsoe earth-like features and are wondering if there is any form of life on this planet. Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters which makes the scientists think that man could probably try to take a trip to Venus in the years to come. Venus is so hot that it is one of the brightest points of the night sky which gives it the nickname ""Evening Star"" and it is really easy for stargazers to spot. NASA is working on other ways of studing Venus such as silicon electronics that could withstand the 800 degree and 90 times greater atmospheric pressure that is on Venus. Studying Venus is very much so beneficial because it seems like there could be a great deal of life-like creatures on this planet within years to come.    ","Dear Senator, I think the United States of America should change or abolish the Electoral College because sometimes it is not actually what the people want. In the 2000 Election Al Gore won the popular vote meaning more people in the USA wanted him at President than the winner. Should'nt we give the people what they want? A poll states thart over 60% of United States voters want to change or get rid of the Electoral College for this exact reason. The state sends people to represent the State not to represent the people. The state or people in office could totally defy whatever the people want in that state. Lets say there is a tie. Then every state would have only 1 vote meaning the little state of Delaware would have as much say as the huge state of California. This example is the complete opposite of doing what the people want.This means the 35 million people have as much say as the 500,000 or sol in Delaware. Our government bases off what the people want but the Electoral College dosen't always base off what the people more than what the state wants itself. Each party representing the state selects the ""trusted"" people for each state. What if those people have a change of heart and they decide to change towards something the state dosen't want. (Which is very possible) Then what would happen? Would either the Democrats or Republicans really be elected or would it just be 270 people in the room just be deciding whatever they want?

416,563,"When asking for advice, you always want to have more than one persons opinion helping you out. When there is only one opinion that you are asking for, then you have a much lower chance of coming to the best possible solution. If you need advice on something and it seems important enough to ask other people for help, then you want at least two or three people helping you out. When people need advice, they normally need to think about the problem first. It all depends on the amplitude of the problem, and quickly it needs resolving. Asking for advice can be very difficult to some people, and easier for others, but everybody needs to ask for help at least once in their life. Some problems can easily be figured out on your own, but the more important, difficult, and time consuming the problem is, the more people you want to ask. Having more than one opinion is the most important thing when you need help with a problem. Whether it is a problem between friends, or a personal delima, you will most likely need help. Only going to one person and asking for their opinion is one of the worst things a person can do, because it may be biased, or difficult to comprehend. Asking at least two or three people for advice is very smart and is highly recommended. Once you have those opinions, and you cant decide which one to go for, averaging is the way to go. You can take a small part of one possible solution and mix it in with another little part of a second possible solution and so on. Then, you will have crafted the best solution for you and your problem. So whenever you have a problem, that needs asking for advice, you always want to ask for it. Asking for at least three outside opinions is the smartest way to go. If the problem isn't that big, and you can solve it by youself, that's great. But a problem of higher amplitude needs at least three opinions to average out a possible solution.","Limiting car usuage would help the world In so many ways. First of all, there wouldn't be that much people getting hurt from car crashes. Also cars were affecting France by letting out to much smog. Cold nights and warm days had affected the warmer layer of air to trap emissions. If you limit car usage then you wouldn't have that problem. Another advantage would be that you wouldn't be Inhaling as much polluted air If cars were limited. Polluted air Isn't good to Inhale and also will mess with people allergies so that would definitely be a big advantage. If car usage Is limited, more people would be active. That would help with people's health and decrease the number of lazy people we have In this world. Plus If another advantage would be that beneficial Implications for carbon emissions and the environment. It would definitely help with that since car transportation Is the second largest source of America's emission. Carbon emissions play a pretty big role to so benefiting that would be fantastic. Limiting car usage would also help you save money by not having to repair your car. You won't have to take It to get checked by a mechanic every three months. You would be saving thousands of dollars If you limited car usage. The day without cars Is the day that Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Also the parks and sports centers have bloomed through the city. Pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. Another advantage Is that rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. New restaurants and upscale shopping districts have Increased. There would be many advantages of limiting car usage. People will find a type of way to benefit themselves from it. It would also be way much better air we Inhale If cars are limited. Saves money that people could be using on more Important things. Limiting car usage would be great.                    ","Every student loves summer vacation. They love Staying home relaxing, going out with friends, swimming at the pool, and so much more! What students do not like during summer vacation though is school related projects. Students are giving projects during the summer to make sure they continue learning and improve their education. That is not always fun, especially for students when they have summer break. Everyone loves to relax and not do anything. That is what summer vacation is for, it allows people, especially students to have some quality time off. Students do not always do their homework, from personal experience that is true. That is why they have less chance of doing projects during the summer when they can be relaxing instead. If they are giving the option to select their own projects they desire, they will more likely finish the project and have fun while doing it. That allows students to stay interested in a certain topic they love to learn about. This makes projects during break way more fun, and it increases the chances of students doing the projects. From personal experience, learning about topics I am passionate about or interested in, makes it way more fun to research and learn about. People might disagree that students do not don't care about their projects, or that they won't do it, regardless what topic it is about. That is false, humans are curios creatures, learning is part of the everyday life for everyone. Learning is fun and it helps individuals develop as a person. Students are more likely to work on projects that is important to them, topics that they love learning about. Everyone enjoys time off, but there is times when everyone has to do work. During summer break, students have time for both. Summer projects will help keep their minds ready and assure they learn during break, while they also have time to relax. Students will increase their effort in projects if the topic is more interesting for them. They should have the choice to choose what projects they want to do on their summer break.","Hello I am a student at your school and i think that community service is great. Some of my friends don't want to do it, so i came up with a plan to help both sides get what they want. The kids that are out here cleaning up the streets are doing a wonderful job but we need more support. If the people that are saying the don't have enough time to do community service because of sports ,should help out kids in the neighborhood stay out of trouble. They could go on the field or in the gym and play after the practices are over. People who are in band could perform a concert for the people in the neighborhood .They could also raise money and build a new park and plant some new trees , the kids could help. I will help you and the staff to encourage other students to help the community but donating a little time for a very good cause. Not everyone agrees that this is the best way to help out but when they see how good the community looks after we are done with our hard work the will believe that it is possible for change if every one chips in. I think this plan will help or community and change how people treat our environment . Hopefully real soon we see some changes in our community and it will get better. I think you should try and make every student do something to help us out , thank you for your time. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principle, Policy 1, giving rights to students to use their phones during their free time, is a better choice to choose since it makes the students more comfortable, make them feel more open-minded in school, and it can even help students in their education by having a source to help them with assignments First, it will be more comfortable for the students. Most schools are big, which is why some students lose their ways during first week of school. If you wanted to meet a friend during a free time or at lunch and you can't find them, what's a better way to find them than calling or texting them? Also, if you don't know where a new class is located, why struggle finding your way when you can text and ask your friend? Secondly, students will feel more open-minded than before. If you ask an average student, whether they like going to school, most of them, honestly, will say no. Now we can't change that answer since school's purpose is to educate the students and the students tend to not like it. However, we can improve the image of the school for the students. If we open the rights to use cell phones during their free time, they will feel way more open-minded than before. This is important because if a student hates going to school and has a closed-mind about it, it will give tons of stress to that student and may effect his/hers educational career. Thirdly, a portable source for the students. Nowadays, most students have some kind of smart phones or maybe just a regular cell phone that has a connection to a web or dictionary. Now imagine you were doing your homework during your free time and you don't know what a word means. Usually, if the right of using a cell phone was not opened, you would have to go to the library and check the dictionary. Now let's say that you had to research a certain topic. You would have to go to a computer in the library or someplace to do that. However, what if the all the computers were used by others. You would have to wait for a while to go on the web. If all these examples were changed to having the right to use the cell phones, you wouldn't have to worry about wasting time because you can do all of these at that exact moment and spot. By reading all of these reasons, I hope you'll choose the policy that's the better for the students. Sincerely, a student","The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus well as it lacks with detail, and they don't go in depth with the pros of exploring this inhabitated plant and how it would benifit us in doing so. In the article we are introduced to Venus and given a glimpse of our background history with them. The author also includes infromation of the planet's atmosphere and how it's a challenging factor for us when attempting to reach its suface, the huge difference that seperates us from them. When given information of past travels, we are informed that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades,"" (TCEV). With this alone there is already doubt engendered in the reader's mind because of how long it has been since we last attempted to reach such grounds and how even then spacecrafts weren't durable when they did make it. ""Each previous mission was unmanned"" due to the circumstances they were met with yet when further reading is made we are told that NASA wants to send humans to Venus. This only adds to the concerns of the reader in manifesting alien-like areas. Then we are explained of possible ways NASA is already planning to approach Venus and how they are already working, or at least contemplaiting, ways to last longer in Earth's 'Twin Sister'. We are given a jot down of how things are being tested and what it is they are trying to overcome in order to create something durable that will hold longer than a few hours. The only reason we are given for this is that ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" (TCEV). The author doesn't even clarify how this is impactful to our society today. What is there to gain from a planet that ""may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system?"" In that sentence alone there is still some uneasiness since it's not sure or confirmed that Venus was once like Earth. Therefore, this is why the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus very clearly. The lack of pros and benifits to our planet adding to the pot of cons and uncertainty that was instead made from reading this article. Surely they did a splendid job in guiding us through possible ways that'll help in exploring the harsh environments and listing final encounters we have had before, but no information was straightforward when it came as to why we should invest time in going to Venus when such dangerous challenges are in front of us.","I would argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states and not keeping the ellectoral college. there are many reasons why i say that and will do that. some people might still want electoral college because of the certainity of outcome, everyones president, swing states, big states, and last but not least to avoid run-off elections. in my opinion i think we should change the election by popular votes instead of ellectoral college, because we the people .. vote for who we think should be head or our state and who we think is going to be in charge and do they thiing and make our a state a better and safier place to live. We dont vote for electors  ... so many people can vote on one paticular person to be head of our state and president and the other person can only get 3 votes  but in ellectoral collage he/she can have more electoral votes and they win the election .. even tho the other canidate has more popular votes. The other reason why i might want to change rhe election by popular votes instead of ellectoral college is becauise of the ""disaster factor"". Which the state legislature are responsible for picking electors..... and the electors would/could always defy the will of the poeple. Those are the two main reasons why i would argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of united states and not keeping the ellectoral college.                                          ",,,,,,,
416,923,"Do you think others thoughts are worth hearing? Would you trust someone else's opinion? These are some questions for you to think about. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and will have better thoughts on different situations. You're getting someone else's perspective. This gives another persons opinion on the situation. Another persons opinion almost always overrides your own because they are giving you a different thought in your mind and it makes you second guess your own thought. It's a reliable source to use when you are in a tight spot. A reliable source is something or someone that you can trust to be right and it helps get great information out of. This gives you better ideas on how to do things differently. Sometimes better ideas that others say is all you need because if you have a better idea on how to handle things differently you have a better solution. A different perspective is like good cop bad cop they look at things differently. You have a dependable person to talk to. Sometimes all someone needs is to be heard. Good listeners are always a good thing because they will listen to the things you say and will try to problem solve. Someone you trust and know will help you out. Almost all the time a person you can trust is the right person to talk to because you know they won't judge you and will help you clear things up. Someone you can rely on even if you are in a rough spot. A person that is reliable and you know you can depend on them for anything is always a keeper because they are the people who will help you make the right choices and will keep you on the right path. Having a dependable person is like having a conscious it will tell you right from wrong. Dozens of peoples opinions are not always reliable. However, some people might say that a lot of people are not always a reliable source. It depends on who you chose to get advice from. People who you don't trust or depend on. These are the people you should not get advice from because they are not a dependable source and you do not know if they will lead you down the wrong path. Seeking others for advice to make a better choice is helpful because you get more than one point of view, you have someone you can rely on, and you will have better thoughts on different situations. People who chose to make better choices and ask others for help succeed in life more than people who don't. Better choices lead you down a successful path and asking others for advice when you think something is wrong is the first way to get there.             ","As human beings we must care for the earth that was so kindly bestowed upon us, meaning we must do all in our power to prevent it from self-destructing due to our carlessness. One way we seem to have recently discoved we can make a difference is that the limiting of car usage is an enormous step towards our goal. Cars have been a topic of contriversy worldwide, as it seems people refused to stop the usage of such a helpful tool in todays society, but as time goes on we have opened our eyes to a world of better choices. Citizens from all around see that car usage can be cut down, and it will be an astonishing change for both humans, as well as the earth. The limitation of car usage will provide a more healthy enviornment for the earth as well as those who live on it. Cars are a simply a machine in which we have allowed ourselves to believe that life can not go on without it. Here we will discover how truley wrong we were. Although we all understand that these vehicles allow use to save much time by getting us to our destinations quicker, it does alot of harm to our planet as well. As stated in the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", cars are responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in certain areas of the United states. The fuel we use to power our cars is released into the O-Zone layer, and into our atmosphere which creates a greenhouse affect and slowly, but surley destroys our enviornment. However, we have the power to protect the planet we live on for we have so many different choices of transpertation that causes way less harm. Cutting down on driving is a simple task in which we can all participate in. Next we focus more on how car limiation affects ourselves. Driving take a toll on us because other forms of transportation do so much good towards ones self being, but as humans we seem to always take the easy way out. If we didnt always use cars, and took a walk for instance it would improve health as well as many other things. In an artice written by Andrew Selsky it states that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" The less smog in the air, the better we can breath which will improve our health, and walking is good for that as well. We don""t need cars to live our lives. Life goes on without the use of a machine. All in all cars we must care for this world as well as ourselves, and this is the first step towards this goal. Some fear that this change in society will have horrible consequences because we are so use to cars in our life, but these vehicles dont control us. By use limiting car usage we are providing a healthier enviornment for both human beings as well as our earth. Lets take the steps toward making this world a better place to live for us as well as the many generations to come. Don't you wish to live in a clean, and healthy world?    ","The usage of summer projects is an undermined technique that schools implement to educate their students. It incorporates an application process to subjects and topics learned in class, to real-world settings. For many students, this process of application is enough to instill certain topics into one's memory. Thus, to ensure that students receive a meaningful and valuable summer project, teachers should have the ability to design and construct these assignments. The reason for this is that teachers effectively utilize summer projects to introduce new topics, have a better understanding of the curriculum and subject, and can emphasize certain topics that are vital for students to understand. Many students might find the first quarter of a new school year a bit cumbersome; however, with the aid of a teacher-designed summer project, students can establish a better academic foundation before entering the school year. This process of learning a topic before it is discussed or taught in school has may psychological and academic benefits. In the book Talent , the author describes the educational process as a learning curve; for our purposes, only the first and second stages in this process are critical to understanding the effects of teacher-designed projects. The first stage of this curve is the data gathering process, where a person begins to input and understand the information into one's conscious thinking: this is typically the longest and most difficult phase in the learning curve. The second stage of this curve is the application process, where people now have the ability to translate their newly acquired knowledge to a real scenario. A majority of students might not know this, but the first step in this learning curve is what students experience in a classroom, which is why students might not fully grasp a topic the first time it is taught. Connecting back to the prompt, the teacher-designed projects act as a catalyst to this learning process, where students aren't starting at the bottom of the data gathering curve, rather, they have already progressed through the first stage of learning. With a general foundation, students have a better ability to digest the information given during class. Moreover, this state of being a faster learner has many psychological benefits; the most important one being a confidence and morale boost. Essentially, feeling that you have this supernatural ability to easily absorb information boosts your confidence in the class, which, in return, increases your productivity in that class. A teacher-constructed summer project ensures that students can begin this learning strategy by introducing new topics that will be discussed during the following year. An important notion that should be addressed is that most students do not have a developed understanding of a subject's curriculum. However, teachers are trained and knowledgeable about the course curriculum, and have the ability to tailor the summer projects to the academic standards the students are expected to uphold. The issue with having a student-designed summer project is that the students might not have the ability to distinguish between topics that are less or more important. On the contrary, teachers posses the ability to guide their students to topics that are beneficial for them to understand. In other words, by allowing teachers to design the summer projects, students gain a better understanding to where the teacher is directing them throughout the new academic year. Despite the evidence listed, some students are still not satisfied with having a teacher-designed project during the summer. The major claims they use to corroborate their defense is that the projects designed by teachers are not interesting enough or they do not necessarily appeal to the students' interest. First, it should be noted that these are very sensible and valid reasons to why someone might not want a teacher-designed summer project. In fact, when people to do not enjoy a certain task, they loose motivation to complete it. However, it should also be noted that teachers consider this claim when designing their projects. Personally, I have always received flexible summer assignments from my teachers, where they have allowed students to add information and topics they find interesting to the overarching theme of the project. Teacher-designed summer projects have the ability to make space for topics that students might find interesting, while also directing them towards important topics and ideas that will be addressed in the following year. Like any logical argument, the good and harm of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects should be juxtaposed. For teacher-designed projects, there benefits include a smooth transition into new topics, outlining important topics and ideas, and a tailored focus to the curriculum. The only major disadvantage to teacher-designed summer projects are that it might not be interesting for the student, which is not always the case. On the contrary, student-designed projects have the benefit of being interesting to the desires of the students themselves. However, student-designed summer projects have many disadvantages including a less reliable topic focus and a meandering project objective. Furthermore, it is evident that teacher-designed summer projects are more beneficial to the students than student-designed summer projects are. ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I personally do not think that community service should be required by all students. Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School. I believe that community service can be an extracurricular activity outside of school, if anything. You see, I know how it's like to be a student, as do you, and I think we can both agree on how hectic situations can get throughout the year. Homework becomes burdensome at times, schoolwork becomes tedious. Your life is bifurcated between school and outside of school, leaving almost no room for anything else. If you were to make community service mandatory at school, how do you think that will unravel? For all you know, petitions could be made by my fellow classmates. I'm sure some of my peers agree with my point of view regarding this topic. I genuinely hope for the best of this school, my intentions are not to be harmful. I want to set straight that I am not just an ignorant, lax, student who is too lazy to participate in community service. I assure you I am not. I take part in community service almost every week, as a matter of fact. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principal, I think that you should let us bring our phones to school and talk to others on it during our lunch and free times. I think that as long as it is not interfering with our learning ability then we should be able to have them. There are lots of reasons why we should be able to have them during lunch. I think that if we were to have our phones out at lunch time that the amount of people having their phones would decrease. If we had time during school to talk/text on our phones then we wouldn't be tempted to use it during class. So with the cell phone use at school less people would break the rule of having it in class. Another reason would also be that we would get to talk to our parents if needed. If we forgot our keys at home and the door is going to be locked when we get home then we would need to call our mom or dad to let them know to leave the doors unlocked, or to bring us the keys to the house. Or we may be feeling a little sick and need to go to the doctor to see what is wrong. I think that it is best for us to call and talk to our mama instead of the people calling and telling them what is wrong with us. See if we went to the office then we would be wasting their time and if we called then we would cause less confusion. These are just a few ways that i think we should have our cell phones at school. If u passed the school rule of having our phones out at school then we wouldn't get in trouble for having our phone out in class.","The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is often referred to as Earth's twin. It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. A difference would be a thick atmosphere. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Humans are curious of what Venus is like. In paragraph 4, Venus could have once had oceans. It could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more. It is hard to study Venus because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also even more challenging are the clouds. They consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. In paragraph 5, it states that NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They want scientists to be able to float above the fray. It says that solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. These are not easy conditions, but are survivable for humans. It is important for them to get up close and personal despite the risks. There are many researchers that are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to study Venus. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is important. Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments. In conclusion, Venus would be just another planet like Earth. ","The way we should change the way we choose our United States president. I am against the Electoral college. I feel like with the Electoral college my vote does not matter. The Electoral college is a pretty unfair way to choose out president. I think its time to try something new. A expirement prehaps. How do we know the popular vote system doesn't work if we had not tried it. You know what they say don't knock it to you try it. We can avoid what happend in 1968 or 2000. Im just saying and im not the only one saying this but the Electoral College is unfair and irrational. The Electoral college is a voting castrophe. Many people fell like their vote doesn't matter or even make a differance. Their not the only ones. Some people just feel like the Electoral College is way too complicated to understand. Some just rather have their vote go straight to the president. Well they say their trust is rarely broken. Well thats still means it can be broken. Also, whats with the ''winner take all'' ? People here that say '' wait what?''.  Well to start off its a little bit unfair. We the people just want to pick our president of united states not some electors who might not even be that loyal to the person you voted for any way. We young generartion should try something new in the future. Which im saying that the Electoral College is a little bit old and outdated dont yout think. This Electoral College can be unfair and irrational at times. Also complicated as well. We voters wish their was an easier way to choose the president. well their is, we just haven't been useing it yet. They say they want to avoid another 1968. Or, even a 2000 election. Well i haven't seen any change or concern for this matter. Instead of chaging the rules , how about we change the voting systems in all. People have been trying to abolish the Electoral College for decades. People like President John F. Kennedy. Even one of our presidents was oppose to the Electoral College. Who is the Electoral Collage any way. Just some people who Dont currently hold office. Well whats the point of knowing who your voting for but not actully know who your voting for. Basiclly voting for someone who can not be trusted or not be loyal enough. We have to vote on trust and confidence. I know i want my vote to matter. So you see why we should change the way we choose our president. The Electoral college is a pretty unfair way to choose out president. I think its time to try something new. Many people fell like their vote doesn't matter or even make a differance. I just want to seeif any change can happen in the future. This Electoral College can be unfair and irrational at times. Also complicated as well. If we want to avoid 1968 or 2000 lets make a change. Atleast lets try it out for a election or two to see how it works. Instead of going off of this is what we been using so we are going to keep using it. Im just saying and im not the only one saying this but the Electoral College is unfair and irrational.    ",,,,,,,
672,109,"Have you ever asked someone for advice? Did you go to one person or did you go to several people for advice? Does it matter how many people you ask for advice? In short, yes it does matter how many people you ask for advice. In fact, the more the better advice you get. Asking more than one person for advice can get you better version of what you're trying to do. The more people you ask, the better the answer. Asking more than one person for advice can get you a more accurate rating of what you should do. The blue socks or the red socks? Ask around, see which ones your friends and family enjoy more. Sometimes, you can also get another option if you're stuck. Let's say you're working on a project and you don't know what to do. Ask some people as to what you should do, maybe you'll get an amazing idea. Asking several people for advice can give you a more beneficial response. Let's say you have a massive test, your friend has already taken this test. You ask him, ""Should I study?"" He responds with, ""No, it was easy."" So you just go with his advice and you don't study. You get to the test day and you realize don't know anything about it, you end up failing the test. If you had just asked your other friends for advice as well, you would've known that it was hard and that you needed to study. You shouldn't just ask one person for advice, they can't just be the end-all-be-all decision maker. You should ask several people whether or not you should do something. A person can be invalid, bias, or even wrong, that's why you consult more than one doctor when you have bad news. Maybe the other doctor realizes something the first one didn't. It's also precisely why consulting more than one person for advice can give a better answer. Asking a variety people for advice can also give a more accurate response of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive about which gaming console you should get, X box or PlayStation 4? You ask your friends and you decide, they give you the pros and cons and even tell you which one they have. You can get a more accurate response of what you should do. You should always consult a variety of people because maybe they can think of something you can't. Different people think about things in different ways. Just the like X box or PlayStation 4 example, people have their reasons, different people have different reasons. Let's say you have a more important decision, like which medication you should take. You should ask different specialist and pharmacist about which one they think is better. Maybe one has less side effects than the other, you won't know unless you ask. If you ask a variety of people you'll get answers that reflect on the right decision that you should make. Asking more people can get you different options if you're stuck. Maybe you don't know what you should write on your essay, you're just stuck and you can't think of what to do. Ask your friends and family as to what you should write, maybe they can give you different options of what you can write. Different prompts, different styles of writing, everyone has their own experiences. You haven't done everything which is what makes other people's points valid, maybe they've done something you haven't. You may get stuck but you shouldn't stay stuck if you ask for advice. The power of asking several people is endless, people can come up with amazing ideas, even if you can't. If you're stuck, ask for some advice, maybe someone was in your shoes and they can give you and answer. It matters that you ask a variety of people for advice because advice can make and idea better, or you could find an amazing idea from advice. You shouldn't rely on one person to give you advice, you should have a group of people. The more people you ask, the better the advice will be. Advice can add on to an idea or it can build an idea. Asking for advice gives you more accurate feedback of what you should do. Maybe you're indecisive and you don't know what to do, ask for some advice to help you along your way. Maybe you can find another solution to the problem you're thinking of, maybe someone has a brilliant idea but they just haven't discovered it. You can be the person who can discover it. You need to ask for advice, you can't get by in life if you don't.","Driverless cars can have many different positive and negative aspects about it. Yet people only tend to look at the positive. A person's brain tends to ""shut-off"" after being told the good things that can come of something new, that they don't really hear the bad of the product. Salesmen use this same technique. Sure having a driverless car can have some purcks, it is still just a acciedent on wheels. What is really the point of owning or even making a car that doesn't allow the driver to even drive? Especually when there are so many things that would have to change in order to make room for the new vehicle. The law was originally made and planned out for cars that are originally driven by humans, but once you get a car that can drive itself, then those laws will have to change. In paragraph 9 it clearly states that ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will need in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"". It proves that the laws would have to change, not only for traffic safety, but also what would and should happen in case one of those driveless cars were to malifunction and cause a serious accident. Even then who would be at fault? ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, then who is at fault?"" The manufacturer could be the at fault if it had to do with the malifuntion of the car's interior of the engine. Or it could be the driver's fault if he or she didn't properly check their car's buttons. Yet the car would still be able to control itself so that the driver is allowed to do many other things. In the case , to say, that the driver has been drinking that night and is in no way in shape to drive for a certain amount to drive. The car can ""handle driving functions of at speeds of 25 mph... they can steer, accelerate, and even break themselves"" (paragraph 7). This just shows the car's many capabilities of what it can do. Also the car has a feature that can allow the driver to turn of the autopilot and allow the driver to take control in case it is needed. Since ""the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"" (paragrph 8). This goes to prove that drivwers are safer in this type of car. As safe as the car may seen, It can be a real challenge to not only operate it, but also it can just be a rea challenge in itself. Dr. Werner Huber, who is a BMW project manager, admits that ""the psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way"" (paragraph 8). Even a BMW manager admits it's a challenge to handle such a car. Plus should the resoncibility of controlling a vehicle really be taken away from the people? Those who are learning or know how to drive should know that they should never have the privilage to be on the cell phone. People need to learn that their actions-such as drinking and driving or texting-do have concequences that they should learn from. In paragraph 8 it states how ""something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone"". Well that is something that no one should be doing in the first place. No wonder it wasn't available to drivers before. Driveless cars should not be driven at all do to the fact that there are just to many risks that are being taken when such a car is being driven on the road. It just creates immature and irresponsible people and is too much of a hassle to deal with. Even for the Government. That is the reason why some states in the U.S. are making it illegal to even test the computer driven cars.","I think we should keep it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States .The electorial college consist of 538 electors . A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President . Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation : one for each member in the House Of Representatives plus two for your senators . Each candidate running for President in your state ha shis or her own group of electors. The Presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. I know are President hasn't done everything he said he was going to do yet but it takes time to be patient .Its We The People that are trying to have what's best for everyone. Over 10,0000 people have the right to help choose are new President .The electorial college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast .The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus there campain rfforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campain .    ","Summer projects are notorious for being not only extremely uninteresting, but incredibly easy to put off. While teachers have tried to find ways of captivating students by giving a variety of choices or making it more hands on, they always miss the real reason why students seems to loathe these assignments. I believe that it all comes down to student choice. Society teaches us that we are all different in our own ways and that people want to do different things, but this is not demonstrated in our schools. A step forward into integrating more individual-focused work is by starting off with one of the most hated assignments for all children, summer projects. Having student-designed projects would give students the chance to explore topics they're interested in, control over how they want they're project to turn out, and incentives creative thinking. The most common response I get from my peers when we get a project over the summer is, ""Why would I need to know about this?"". This leads to them not caring about the outcome of their assignment and putting minimal effort into it, thus leading to lackluster scores. This could be absolved by letting them choose what they want to learn more about. Seeing that it is the summertime, I believe that students shouldn't be tied down to one subject, but use their break to learn whatever they feel that they need to put more time into. Even if it has to revolve around one subject, they should have the option to include aspects of other subjects that they would find more enjoyable. Giving them the option to choose where they want their time to be spent would open up different avenues for them to take their learning. Students want more control over how they want their work to turn out. Giving strict restraints on how the project should be about and its formatting disincentives students who work at a slower pace and holds back those who work faster. Rather than molding the student to fit into the curriculum, make the curriculum easier to mold. Give students the best opportunity to grow and succeed rather than holding them to a set standard that all can't meet. We all have different preferences and learning levels and our work should reflect those differences. Letting them design their own projects would challenge them to think creatively. With the option to take aspects of multiple subjects and to illustrate it in a precise manner, you would have to think of creative ways to present it. This would force students to think carefully about what information they want to include and the undertones that it could have, just like in real world presentations. With the choices that would be given to them, students would have to find the right combination of formats and subjects that would most accurately reflects their goal. While some would say that it could lead to students choosing the easiest route, I believe this comes from a place of little faith. Given the chance to learn more about something that actually interests them, I think that most students would jump on the chance. The reason why students, especially high school students, seem so apathetic is that we aren't interested. We feel as if we're just going through the motions of school and that summer projects are just a way to bleed more of our time away. The problem isn't the student, but how the system is set in place. Summer projects have always been a chore to do. From the uninteresting topics, to the fact that it's during the summer has always made students dread, but if these projects were designed by the students, I think we would see a sharp spike in enthusiasm around their arrival. Being able to choose the topic, have control over how it turns out, and the need to actually think creatively would excite students and teachers alike. Giving us the chance to express ourselves would be the right direction for summer projects.","Things in life has changed over the years 2018 is a whole new year with many things different then the 1980s for sure. In the past there was no phones or laptops. Now in the present almost everyday something comes out new. There is always a new software here and there. I do not find that a ""Facial Action Coding System"" is valuable for kids in the classroom. I do not think that it is valuable for kids in the classroom. I do not think that it is valuable because if kids do not understand they will have a confused look on their face. They will also be the ones to ask questions about what they are confused on. Kids have many emotions but I do not think that it will be able to be hard to tell if they are struggling or not. They said in the passage that it is a painting ""It's the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa."" Also in one of the paragraphs below it says that the human face has to have all 44 muscles in the face to be able to show if they are happy, sad, digusted, etc. In the painting how could there be 44 muscles is the real question. You can not paint 44 muscles in all the right spots when not everyones face is the same shape. Having the same size shape of the face and testing people I can see why they would say that you would be happy or sad. This is a painting and there is probably not a single person with the same face as Mona Lisa. The ""3-D"" computer model could possibly show all 44 musles in the face but that would be a lot of face scanning because like I said before in my last sentence there could not possibly be someone with the same face shape. How can they test multiple people when those people could have the muscles all over there face. There is simple ones like the ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle"" which is above your eyes and the ""orbicularis oris"" which is around the mouth. that is only 2 out of the 44 muscles that they have to scan on a persons face. If they wanted to test multiple people that would have to have someone who actually knows where all of the muscles are. In the right stop because if you guess the spots the mood can be wrong. I do not find that it should be used on anyone. Human communication is when two or more people talk together. That is one of the most simplest ways to find out if the kids in your classroom does not understand what you are going over with them. Emotional communication is when someone lets out all of the emotions that they have and will show them becasue they will either be mad with a grumpy face on or they will be upset and not smile at all. I came up with that it is not valuable for kids in the classrooom because I do not understand why there would have to be a software out when the student could just ask a question in class or even ask after class. There's many other things to do then to have to scan the face and have someone point all of their facial muscles out to find out how they feel. Plus there are multiple kids in the classroom that you would have to scan and not everyone has the same facial structure that would be many times pointing out every single facial muscle and finding out how they feel when there are simpler ways to figure it out. ","The author is trying to slowly but surley teach us about the""evening star"" which is venus. Although we can examine the planet from a far it wouldnt be of any use if unable to look at the planet closley. Also called the earths twin which only means their close in density and size and close in distance at times. Numerous spacecrafts have been sent to explore the cloud draped world and every mission was unmanned since no spacecraft managed to survive a landing for more than a few hours. Venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and contains highly corrosive sulfuric acid which wasnt safe for ant man or woman. These facts are little to none to what we could learn if we advanced our technology and support on the idea of exploring venus. NASA had thought of an idea to get closer to the planet which involved a blimp like vehicle hovering over the planet safely. This planet has value and our exploration shouldnt be limited by danger our own curiousity will lead us to explore deeper and ever far more than needed.","You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to go to fun and unique places. We Have fun adventers. You get to take care of horses and baby cows and if you don't like it then play a volleyball game or a baseball game in the empty holds that had been where animals were held. We went to China,Europe,Acropolis in Greece,Venice,and Italy. It's really fun to be able to do this stuff with people and animals and that is why you should participate in the because its so cool to see everthing you have dreamed of your whole life. It might take a few days,weeks,mounths,or even years but at least you get to see all kinds of different things that is not what you always see everyday of your life at home at the same place you should go out and see all kinds of different places because it fun and you get to play with the animals all the time besides when your alseep.

672,235,"Have you had to make a really hard choice, and you keep second guessing yourself? Well, everyone feels like this at some point in their life. It's just if you want other people's opinion in your decision. There are many positives in other opinions other than yours. You should listen to them. One opinion is not good when you want to make a good choice. Multiple opinions can help you find out what you really want to do, to make it a good choice. Here is an example, you are picking your classes for next year and it's a big year too, 9th grade. You are struggling to pick your last elective, you ask your family what to do. They tell you to do what you like. The next day you go to school and you ask all of your friends. They tell you to do what you love, band. So you go home and think about it, and come to the conclusion that you do love band so you go ahead and pick that as your elective. For this example you can clearly see that when you ask multiple people about what you should do, They tell you their honest opinion and it helps you figure out what you want to do. Why is asking more than one person good? There are many reasons why it is good to ask more than just one person if you are wanting them to help you make a hard choice. One of them is, it opens your thought process, so if you are thinking a little bias on something. They can make you think about the other side of the problem. Another positive of have more than one opinion is, in the end result you will be happy. Even if it is not what you had expected, you will still be happy. Some people dont talk to others when they feel a certain way. So lets say that your friend had her heart broken by someone, and you are have trouble with your relationship too. You go to them for help, and when you ask they give you all of their personal experience. To them it feels really good to open up to everything that had happened to them, and at the same time they are helping you. Sometimes you are helping a lot more than you think, not just for yourself but that friend. Have you been second guessing yourself on a really hard choice? Everyone has done this at least once in their life. Their are people in your life that could help you stop second guessing yourself and make the right choice. There are so many positives in other peoples opinion. You should listen to them.","Driverless Cars Are Not Good! Driverless cars means a car that does not need a human to control of the car. Driverless cars are not safe because you can't tell if something bad can happen to it or not. If it's safe, why aren't there any in the public. Even the producers of the cars are not 100% sure of the condition. The car can't deal with big problems like; dealing with complicated traffic issues. It is better to use the now days cars than the driverless. It would cost a lot more than the cars that we use now. The driverless cars are not trustworthy. What if you fell asleep while they car can't deal with the traffic issues? The cars are not use yet where the people like us can see it. What if the car doesn't hit the brake when you're about to crash? Some people are more confortable when they drive. It may be the double price of the cars that we're using right now. It is better to have Honda or Toyota than the driverless car because you have the control of the car. It is important to have control of the car because you might want to change your location when you're driving. You save more money. You can feel more better if have control. If you're on driverless car; I am sure that you would feel scared. Some people feel more confortable when they drive because they don't trust the driver. Technology is high but is it high enough to drive but it's self? If you're really sleepy and the driverless car is in the situation of traffic issues; what you it do? You might as well just crash. If you drive the normal cars it is safer and better. It is safer because you have control of it. If you're too sleepy, you can take a nap first. Finally, driverless cars are cars that is not controlable. You don't know if its safe or not. There is no benefits; it's just that it is better because it uses less fuel than the amount we're using right now. Drive normal cars are better because it cost less. If you have control of the car; you feel more confidence.                ","The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it. Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government. Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage. The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a ""winner-take -all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat. Everything that is rong with the electoral collage. Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.    ","School summer projects is the thing that students most dread in the summer, apart from summer school of course. Most of the time they are big, boring packets filled with long and boring questions. Usually everyone waits until last minute to complete them because thinking about them during vacation ruins the fun. But with student design projects everything would be different. School summer projects should be student designed instead of teacher designed. It would help the students get interested in the projects and topics they are about to learn, it would help the teachers better cater to their students in their lessons and it would also help the students explore their creativity and critical thinking in school related assignments. A teacher's school summer projects is usually just a very thick packet with a lot of questions and a lot of work, they are no fun at all and students dread getting them. Most of the time this projects are not even projects, they're very thick packets with the words 'summer project' at the top in big bold letters. With students being able to create their own student projects they can cater to themselves this allows them to design the project around something they did during their summer vacation or about an experience they had. These projects should be about using creativity to design something fun that involves what the students are learning and what they're experiencing in the real world. Most of the summer projects are assigned for their class courses for their upcoming school year. Having something that relates their summer vacations and their classes makes the students exited about their courses and all that they can do with it. It demonstrates to the students what they can do in real life with what they are learning at school. Since the students don't know what their summer project is they are going to be thinking about it their whole summer, when they do something they are going to be thinking about how it relates to that subject and if that can be their project. With students learning at different in different ways this allows them to demonstrate what their way of learning is and what they are most comfortable with. for example for visual learners it could be a poster with big picture and little to none words, for someone who doesnt not learn with drawings it could be a question and answer type project. Student led projects allow students to design their own project is the best way to capture their attention and make them exited about school. Allowing students to create their own project would not only be beneficial to the students but also to the teachers. When looking at the projects it allows the teachers to get to know the students, as in every project there will be a part of the students in them. Even though teachers try to it's hard to relate to all of their students. Student designed projects allows the teachers to learn about what type of learners their students are, whether they are visual learners or something else it teaches them about how they can better reach their students and not loose their interest during the school year. This will also help the teachers when making their student plans, when they look at the project they will be able to see what part of the course the students are most exited about learning, what part they have already mastered and what part what part the student seem more confused about. With this information teachers can better creates their teaching plans and better cater to their students and their needs. When making teaching plans it is very important to mold it to the individual because not everyone learns the same way, and this project will help. Catering to each students learning pace and design helps them learn and be successful in their test and their future in those classes. Permitting the students to deign their own projects also helps with creativity. In school everything is very structures, it help the students function better and have a more organized school, which is good. Having said this, having structure does not allow students to explore their creativity and their critical thinking all in one, with school related assignments. Creativity is a very important part of learning and if students are not allowed to express themselves once in a while they get bored and loose interest in the subject or in school all together. When students are allowed to design their own project they are able to explore their creativity in school assignments. Allowing them to design their own project allows them to express themselves in a way where critical thinking is essential to completing the task. Creativity and critical thinking are essential pieces to be successful in the real world and in professional settings. When giving summer assignment teachers are expecting student to have fun and to keep learning during their summer vacation, but are students expected to have fun doing the assignments if teachers dont put anything fun in them. When assignments are not fun students loose interest and don't want to even think about completing the assignment. Students should be able to create their own assignment. Having student designed summer assignments would be beneficial to students and teachers. It would help o the students explore a new way of thinking about assignments, it would also help them explore their creativity and critical thinking all together, and it would also help teachers when planning their lessons to help find the best way for students to learn. ","No one wants to wach ads but wouldnt they be more intresting if there was a way they could relate to us more. In the article ¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨by Nick D´Alto he talks about a way that a coding system can read our emoitions. In the text they talk about a program called Facial Action Coding System that will use our emotions to make our experience with technology better. The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valiable because ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive. Ads are an example on how the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable. In the text it states ¨For example, if yoy smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be dirffent.¨ (D´Alto). So if a student is doing somthing on a computer and an ad pops up for a math game and he dosnt like it the next ad could change to a math game that he does help. The ads coud help the student find a game that can help him learn. Ads and keeping the student mare intrested are ways the Facial Action Coding System is valuble. Keeping the students intrested is also another way the Facial Action Coding System can be benifical to a student. In the text it says ¨A classroom computer coud recognize when a student is becoming confused¨ (Dr. Huange). If it could reconize that then it could modifiy the lession. The lession would be better for a student and also it would be like having a teacher right next to you teaching you in the way you learn best. Keeping the students intrested is anothe way the Facial Action Coding System can be valiuble but there is one more example. The Facial Action Coding System can make animated faces more expressive. The author states ¨ The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive¨ (D´Alto). When taking an online corse if a animated faces could be more expressive it would make the student more involved. Also it could make the student feel like they have some one to help right next to them. This is how making animated faces more expressive can help students in a classroom. This is how ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive help support the claim that the use of emotinal reading technology can be valuable for a student. By making things more personal. Also by keeping the student intrested so they dont get side tracked. Finaly by keeping the student happy. Wouldent you want a more presnal expericence when learning to help keep you intrested and more involved?    ","Venus is a mystery planet but is also very similar to earth. Why havent we explored it yet? Venus should be explored because it is fairly close to us sometimes in the year. Venus also shares a lot of characteristics with earth. If humans were able to explore Venus then we would possibly be able to make a new planet livable to humans and also give us much more knowledge about space and planets. Sometimes Venus is closer to Earth than Mars. In paragragh 2 it states that, ""Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too."" We are starting to learn about mars and if Venus is close to earth when mars is far then we should have no excuse not to explore Venus. Since Venus is so close to Earth then we could possibly make a new livable planet and also have a whole new line of information for scientists to study and explore with.","In 1945, World War ll had just ended. 44 countries joined to create the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration. The UNRRA is an administration that helps a country that has lost quite a bit in the war. The UNRRA helped countries that lost food supply, animal supply, and more. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to help care for the horses, young cows, and mule that were going to be shiped to other countries. I think that there are many reasons that people should join the UNRRA. The first reason that I have provided for you is that This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The second reason I have is because even though you will be working you will be able to spend time with animals and you will see many sites that you would not have seen if you would have stayed home. The third reason I will provide is that not many people can do big oversea trips like that, a lot of people get very seasick. My final reason is that you would know you would be helping innocent people. You would know this because not everybody is in on these wars in fact most people are not in on big wars because they know it will tear apart their family. I think that there are some claims that Luke has made that I should share. I think that one of Luke's claims that I should share is he said, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."". I think that he could support this because a lot of people, families, homes, and countries are destroyed and seperated. Another of Luke's claims was, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Accropolis in Greece was special."" I think that this can be supported because this would be truely amazing. I think that he did a good thing to choose to help the UNRRA, but being able to see Europe, China, and Greece would be incredible. I think that Luke was a very incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"". I think that some details to suppot this are that he lasted 9 trips to nine different countries. This is incredible because that is the longest any ""Seagoing Cowboy"" has ever lasted. I think another reason he is an incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"" is because he decided to help the UNRRA. I bet that at the begining he was extremely nervous and I bet that he wanted to go home to his mom, dad, and siblings if he had any. My last reason that he was incredible is that he kept working even if he got seasick, or if he wanted to go home. I think that work was one thing that he used to get his mind off of things he worried about. There are some thing that he could've done on the positive and the negative side. First, on the positive side, I thinkthat if he really set his mind to it he could've been a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" for at least 10-12 trips. I think that some benefits to staying longer would be that you would've been able to do more sight seeing, also you would've been able to spend more time with the animals. One thing that would be negative is that he would've gotten seasick more times than without staying. I think that I would've signed up for this opportunity because I love animals and I really like being on the ocean. I think that this would be a great chance. I think that they should have things like this in 2016. I think that there are a lot of countries that could use something like this, one that I can think of off the top of my head is Syria. They could use all the help they could get, they could use food, shelter, animal products, and animals in general. I think that I would think the same way as Luke. I think that me and my friends would all sign up and we would do everything together. We would care for the animals together, we would eat together, we would sightsee together, and lastly we would take breaks and stop together. My overall thought is that this would be great but it would also be extremely dangerous.",,,,,,,
672,494,"Haven't you got an advice from multiple adults in your daily life? Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing. He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively. Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one."" Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. You could also use the people's advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it. This is my thoughts on why some people would like multiple and how it can affect them in a certain way.","Ok, now how would you like to have a car that drives itself? I'm talking soon, like next 5-10 years. Sounds great, sounds real futuristic, but I just know those things can't be successful anytime soon. Personally, I would love to ride in a driverless car one day but that's a huge risk to take. To start off with, a driverless car does sound prety cool. I mean it coulld introduce so many oppurtunities for the world that we've never seen yet. A driverless car could be the start of something new. Like Google cofounder Serge Brin believes, such cars could change the world fundamentally. In counterclaim to that, THERE WILL NEVER BE A COMPLETELY DRIVERLESS CAR! Well, at least that's how I see it. I mean a driverless car, I know it's 2016, but that's going past the limits. It's all pure imagination if someone believes a driverless car will be accepted into the streets of the world. There's only one HUGE reason I say it won't happen though... A driverless car will never be safe enough to count on. I mean be real, would you ride in a plane wth no pilot with only computed sensors telling you what's going on around your plane? What's going to happen if one of those sensors on the car don't react one time? Like I know everyone has had a surprise mishap with a computer-generated system before. Think if your car caught a virus or something or just was being used too much, your on the road, then our car starts going crazy and drives off the road. Who's fault will it be? What if someone gets hurt because of your car, not you or the car's manufacturer, but your car? In conclusion to all this, I think it's a brilliant idea to have. It definitely presents many arguments, but I wouldn't be in a driverless car even if it was my only choice. I wouldn't want my life in the hands of a technological device or machine or whatever it'd be called. ","Changing the election by popular votes for the presidents of the United States is fair right? We'll it says according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of the voter would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. Next, There are problems with the electoral college system voters vote not for a slate of electors, who inturn electthe president. Imagine if we had electoral votes it would be much easier and fair for all the people, than just rather have senate or House of Representatives have to pick, or Congress. At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters. Then, Some of the problems that we have, Because of the winner take all syste, in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning and that's a big problem focusing only on the tight races inthe ""swing"" states. It is informing us that During the 2000 there was a campaign that seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including states Rhode Island and South Carolina. and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voter, they have yetto make it. Last, It almost obvious the electoral college is unfair, outdatedand irrational. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this butBob Dole was right he said to Abolish the electoral college. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election then, In 1976,  a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe In conclusion, we voters have to stand up for our rights achieve our goal making this a better country and society to live in. Electoral votes should be made it is a much easier system. Changing the election by popular votes for the presidents for the United States is fair right? It is fair because it makes our country muche easier and better place to live. Some of the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. It is clearly unfair Electoral College votes should be madefor everyone to have popular votes, to vote in this country.    ","It has been proven, that schools that have summer projects verse schools that don't have on average a 15% higher testing average on finnal exams. All schools, except year around schools, have a nine week period where students are given a break from school and enjoy doing other activitys. During the summer many student take a break from school and explore more intrest, or get a summer job, or some even travel, ect. While summer can be a great experience for students, many students tend to lose valuable information that they learn the year prior. This causes teacher to have to review material from the previous year for the first couple of weeks during the new school year. To compact this issue many schools have started assigning summer projects, that helps students retain some of valuable information and make the transiton back to school easier. Most summer projects are teacher- designed , which mean that teacher come up with the concept of the project and have set expectations for that project. Althought some may believe otherwise my experience, the experience of friends, and the experience of classmates helps prove that summer projects should be student-desighned. Based on my personal experience, summer projects should be student-designed. Last year I was assigned to write an essay based on shadowing experience of a career of your chosing. This was a student-designed project because students got the option to write about whatever particular career fasinated them. At first it was dificult to decide what career I wanted to chose, but in the end I ended up shadowing at a veterinary clinic. This was one of the best decisions I made, because it not only helped show me a potential career I might want to pursue, but also a major I might want to study in college. If this project was teacher designed and I was forced to write about a partiular subect I had no intrest in, then I might have never found out about my passion for helping for animals. While some may argue that teacher-designed project are more useful for the subject course, my student- designed project was more important because it helped me discover some new intrest, and it is important that schools help students discover what intrest them. The experience of my friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name help prove that summer projects should be student-designed. Generic_Name summer project require her to complete a question and answer packet based on the first four chapters of the text book. Generic_Name project was to come up with a unique way of presenting the first four chapter to the class, so that they better understood the material. In the end, Generic_Name waited untill the last three days of summer to complet her packet, and ended up not full understanding the concept of the textbook. On the other hand, Generic_Names project required more work and time, which ment that she needed to not only start sooner, but also come up with a schedual that allowed her to finish before the project was due. This project helped Generic_Name develope better time management skills, and she ended up better understanding the concept as well. Some may arugue that the amount of work and time ashely spent on the project verses Generic_Name simple packet that didnt take as much time or effort wasnt as vauluable, but Generic_Name grades ended up suffered the first quarter due to her poor understanding of the material, and poor time mangement skills. My classmate Generic_Name helps show the importance of student-directed projects. Generic_Names summer assignment was to present a worldly issue that impacts a country of his chosing to the class. This was a student-directed project because Generic_Name got to decide how he was not only going to direct the project, but what topic and country he would do. At first Generic_Name found this tasks quite dificult, and decided to gather a few of his friends to help eachother with the project. Generic_Name and his friends decided to do the same worldly impact but for diffrent counties. Without the colaboration of him and his friends, Generic_Name wouldn't have been able to excute the project as well as he did. Working together is always better than working alone, because it allows for people to show diffrent perspectives that you alone might not have taught of. Generic_Name also stated ""if it was not for the help of my group I would have give up on the project' which helps show the importance of a support system. Although some may want to state that a teacher-directed projects are more insightful, working together increases a student responsibility skill and willingness to do the project because they have a duty to your group to finish the project.","Having this type of technology can help people understand others emotions in many ways. It is obvious that this type of technology can not only help others understand students emotions, but possibly help the students who are feeling a certain way. I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. Having technology that can help show how a person is truly feeling is hepful in so many ways. For example, helping a person out who is feeling sad. A student in the classom is normally good at hiding their true emotions or how they are really feeling, but with this technology, a teacher could possibly help this student out once finding out that the student was upset or bothered with something either inside or outside of the classroom. Another way this technology is valuable is by being able to notice when a student is flustered or angry about not understanding a certain part of what they are learning. Not only can this technology determine one emotion, but can determain mixed emotions. This could help a lot when a student in the classroom may not fully understand a topic they are learning but say they understand it completly. Having the chance to use this technology can help students further understand the subject they are on, because the teacher for sure recognizes that the student may not understand it. This also means teachers have more of the oppertunity to help their students out mentally. The use of this technology in classroms is very valubale for many obvious reasons. ","No one has ever landed on venus so the author is saying this because no space ship has survived landing for more than a few hours. maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on veunus more than three decade, venus really is a challanging planet for people to study. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers venus, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in the atmophere. On the surface, temperatures average over 800 degress F and the pressure is 90 times greater than our planet. The conditions are extreme than anything humans encounter, due to the pressure and th heat of venus. Beyond the pressure and the heat venus has geology and wather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to the land surface. It'll be dangerous even trying to live on venus but if you want to live on vnus be prepared for these desasters. Like for example our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would advoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. This is why NASA is working on a wat to approach and study venus, like some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tsted in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in the conditions of venus. Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling venusian landscape, that'll be very cool and amazing to see and watch on TV. Just if you ever think about wanting to go visit venus..make sure you bring lots of water and a cooling suit that'll cool you when you attempt to walk along across venus.

He was in a program called Seagoing Cowboys. In the story are reasons to join the program here are some. You can travel the world and go to places that you have never been. You will travel in the oceans like the Alantic and Pacific. While you do this job if you like animals this would be a good job for you because Luke had to check on the animals every hour so u could sign up for that part .Luke's claim was that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an job. I know this because the passage says that Seagoing was much more than an adventure "" it opened up the world to him"". In all Luke Bomberger was a man who thought that that Seagoing was a lifetime opportunity and loved it.",,,,,,,
672,563,"When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person. It is better to talk to more people than just one. The reason why it is always better talk to multiple people is because the more people you talk to the more advice you have. The least people you talk to the less advice you have. When you talk to a lot of more people you have more varieties of advice to pick the one you want to use. Some people have negative thoughts in there mind and when they ask for advice that can help them out a whole lot. Then when they get a lot of good advice of what to do, and how to not have negative thoughts. This can change there life a whole lot and really help them out. Whenever someone ask for advice you should always give them it, because you never know what they are going through. Also that advice can be very helpful to them. When asking for advice you should never ask just one person to get advice from always ask multiple, like family or close friends so it is more choices to pick from. Some people can be about to do something very bad that can make them go to jail, or hurt themselves. So you have to step up and stop them from doing it by giving them good advice. Therefore, When giving or getting advice always give it to multiple people or receive it from multiple people.","There are many people that are for having driverless cars, but I am against it. I am against it for many reason. First reason is because it will make people lazy. Second reason is because a computer cannot think like a human brain. Last reason is because they are not safe. My first reason I am against these cars are because they will make people lazy. America already has enough lazy people. So why will we waste money on sensors to make a car drive by itself when we can control it ourselfs. According to paragragh 7 ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselfs."" But paragraph 7 also say ""road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Which proves the only time you will actually have to drive is if you run into those situations. Another reason I am against driverless cars ae because we can't trust technolgy to get us out of every situations. For example say you are riding and you car comes out to oncoming traffic and it wont stop. There will be nothing yuo can do to stop it. But if you can actually control the car than you wont have to worry about that because you know when to stop our car. Technology wise we are not ready for a driverless vechical. My final reason I am against these cars are because the just arent safe. There are so many things that can happen while driving this car. For example a glitch can happen in the systemor you cars brakes stop working and you wont be able to stop and you could have nothing to do about it. In paragragh 6 it say a radar cost ""two hundred million dollars."" Why can't we use that money to make cars we can frive by ourselfs safer other than wasting money on a computer that can glitch out and stop working on us? I am against driverless cars because they will make us lazier as a nation. They cannot think like a human brain. And finally because they just are not safe enough to be on the roads.","Dear senator, I am PROPER_NAME and i'm writing to you about the issues of the electoral voting process. Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States for a couple of reasons. First, I will know who I am voting for instead of thinking I am voting for the person I wanna vote for, And second the votes will be fair To start off with, If we keep the electoral voting process then we will continue not knowing who we are voting for , The text asked itself a question ""Do citizens sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong canidate?"" And the answer was sometimes this process is to confusing for thed citizens to understand and it is not fair to use we have the right to vote but who are we voting for? What are we voting for? If we don't know who we are voting for then why vote. I understand having electors reduces the chance of having a president who can't carry our state,Eventhough the text says is takes away the chance I still think it reduces it I mean look at the Bush family they did a horible job and guess who elected them the electors. But still we have the right to vote for who we want but thats not the case, The case is that we vote for the the electors to represent our vote. I also dont agree with the winner take all vote because is I vote for someone i want me vote to go to that person not switch over to the other because he or she has the majority of the votes. For my next statement, I will be addressing the fact of unfairness the winner take all rule is not fair as a add on the bigger the state the more electoral votes it gets is not for every state should count as a equal amount of votes because its like the little states doesn't get any say in who gets to represent us. ""Do you have a older brother or sister? If you do then you know how it feels to get the remote tooking away from you and not get to watch what you want."" And that is the same case here. So I urgue you senator to help us citizens toi change the way the voting process is set up so we can understand who we are voting for and help us make a fair choice so our vote can stand for something. From, PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME                           ","School ends, summer break starts, and students wants to relax. However some schools require that students to use their break as a time to continue their journey of education, so they provide projects over the summer. These projects are usually designed by teachers, but some argue that students should be designing the projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know more about the curriculum, their professional job is to teach, and students are not suitable to design a project for themselves. Teachers are very familiar with the curriculum of their class, much more than a typical student. Given that they are more knowledgeable about the material, they are best suited to design projects for students in the summer. Many seasoned teachers know the material in the back of their hand, they know what works for students and what doesn't because they have been teaching it for several of years. It's common sense that they would be extremely familiar with what they're teaching. They've seen students come and go in their classroom and witnessed what most students tend to struggle on since students don't nearly know as much as their professors. If students wanted to design their own summer project, it would be atrocious because students simply don't have this kind of knowledge. They don't know the most effective way to design a project using the material of the class. Because teachers have this knowledge that students lack, it's clear as to why teachers can design the best summer project that forces the student to learn and be prepared for the upcoming school year. Not all people are professionally allowed to teach others, and it's a teacher's gift to do so. It's obvious that teachers know how to design a summer project that properly engages the student to learn, because it's their professional job. It's not easy to become a teacher, it takes them several of years at a university to get their degree in education. It takes hard work and dedication to go through the process of becoming a teacher, and not all people are capable of doing so. Because of their hard work to become a teacher, they truly are the most trusted individuals to provide a way to help their students learn. Their whole job is to properly engage students and help them learn, and who better to design summer projects than the same people who are legally allowed to teach. Schools hire the best individuals for the job because they all are eligible to teach and pass on information in an engaging way. They know how to make a student learn, rather than the student them self. It's clear as day as to why they should make summer projects since teachers are people who love to teach, it's why they chose this profession. Having someone passionate about their love for teaching is the perfect candidate for making summer projects for students because it's what they love to do, rather than a student who probably doesn't nearly have the same passion. Students typically don't look forward to learn or do school projects over their longest break of the year, and they certainly are in no position to design the projects that they complete over summer. During summer, all students really want to do is relax and enjoy their time off since they look forward to summer break all year. The last thing they want to do is complete a project. If students were to design summer projects themselves, it would be a disaster. If they were given this privilege, students would take this opportunity to make the project so it wouldn't be as thoughtful or engaging like a project that a teacher would design. Frankly, they would make the project so it wouldn't take much work and effort to complete it, making it easy enough where they wouldn't learn at all. It's understandable that they would do this because most students don't want to do projects over summer, and having teacher design projects forces students to actually learn and engage with the material. Students simply are not suited to design projects for their summer break, it's like having students make their own exam in class, it frankly doesn't really work out because exams and projects are things students hate the most. Having a student make their own test is ridiculous because they can make it so it would take minimal effort to complete, and it translates perfectly to how they would design projects. Some may argue that students know what works for them when it comes to learning, but that simply isn't true. Our education system is built on the information that teachers provide, and because of their years of teaching, professors definitely know how to engage a student and make them eager to learn. Given the fact that teachers are knowledgeable on their material, legally allowed to guide students, and students are not the best to design their own work, it's fair to say that teachers are indeed the best individuals to design summer projects for students.","Making Mona Lisa Smile In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human motions. How people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions. In the smile of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Felt the experince of ""The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". People are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions because in a new technology can describe the human motions. They know that the painting of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted they calculate the facial expressions for each emotion universal. The motions of any students in a clasroom computer are confused or bored. In the painting many know the feeling motions of her smile but have 83 percent happy in her smile. In the painting of Mona Lisa is 6 percent fearfun and 2 percent angry. This is painting to recorgnize for many people in all the world, because is an painting of Leonardo da Vinci's. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games to learn more about the motions of people. An example of the text is ""Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vanci Code"". The theory of motion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The Mona Lisa demostration expression is really intended to bring a smile to your face. The new motion-recognition sofware tracks these facial basic motions are happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. The facial emotions for universal to many students want to investige the painting of Mona Lisa. Many use the same techonology for conclude the different motions of the painting. The students can talk about the experince of the Mona Lisa demostration of her emotions about a painting very good. In conclusion the author describes a new technology called ""The Facial Action Coding System"". Because the technology help to know the emotional expressions to students. The painting of Mona Lisa is very famous in the world however many students can use the new technology to learn more about the human motion.             ","The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining the similarities between the Earth and how we can overcome our differences as well. The author believes it is worthy of a shot because of the ways to avoid major problems, such as flying at a high altitude to evade the extreme pressure of the atmosphere and dangerous sulfuric acid clouds. The text states, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This piece of evidence shows how clever the author is willing to get to investigate Venus and just how possible this may actually be. The text also states, ""...not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equallty intimidating endeavors."" This evidence goes to show that not he is not interested in exploring the planet to purely learn about the planet itself, but it is also human curiosity that pushes us as a race to adventure and discorver things that are of the unknown. In conclusion the author strongly supports the idea of pursuiting the exploration of Venus despite the dangers it presents. Although as the author stated, it is better to think of these ""dangers"" as challenges, as we can overcome them and reach our goal. We have the potential and technology to get there, we just need to put our heads together and do it.",Do you know what the Seagoing Cowboys program does? It helps people from around the world.

672,923,"Advice about receiving advice Doing something one way and then realizing there was a great amount of other options is a very annoying (and unfortunately, very common) case. It's even more annoying when you don't realize what the other solution was because then you can never grow as a person. People should ask more than one person for advice when seeking it because not everything will work for everyone and it's always better to hear from different sources. Not everything will work for everyone, as everybody has their own way of dealing with certain things. Say there's a student in algebra honors and they are studying for a test that is stressing them out very much. Now, this student has trouble paying attention in class, and as a result of that, they often don't have the best of notes. If the student's parent is giving them advice and the parent says to the student that they should check their notes, the student will most likely have to seek help elsewhere because that advice is not very good for them in particular. It's always better to hear from different sources. There are lots of times when you need to seek multiple solutions. In science labs, multiple trials are required to find out if the initial hypothesis was correct. When writing about current events, one must gather information from different sources or they could be risking the possibility of being biased. It's no different when people are seeking advice from someone. If somebody receives advice from one person and they aren't happy with outcome of the advice they took, chances are they didn't hear from enough people and a different solution was just waiting for them to try it out. At the end of the day, receiving advice from multiple people is the best thing to do because not everything will work for everyone and it is always better to hear from more than one source.                                                                                                                                                                                          ","The driverless car is the way of the future. It's a great invention that, with time, could eliminate the hassle of having to drive everywhere yourself. Regular cars would become useless when cars could drive themselves. The driverless car is a great invention and development should be supported in the future. A car that could drive itself would be magnificent. The self driving car could half the fuel of taxis and save people money. Humans would be relatively safe in a self driving car as well. Google has had driverless cars drive for over half a million miles without any incident. The cars are so fabulous that they alert the driver when entering and exiting driveways in order to have maximum safety and minimal crashes. The driverless car does have some negative aspects as well. The car cannot completely drive by itself and still needs a driver at the wheel at all times. The driver is needed to assist the car in navigating through difficult traffic situations such as a wreck or a road under construction. The cars can only steer, brake, and accelerate by themselves without having a driver involved. People also argue that the cars could also be dangerous. A car that drives manually is frightening for many people who still want to control how fast or how slow their car is going. Putting trust into a car that could possibly wreck is nerve-wracking for many people. Even though the self driving car does still need a driver, that doesn't mean the driver actually has to manually brake or accelerate. The car does this on its own without human support. All the driver has to do is help the car navigate through complex traffic problems, which are not an everyday occurance. The driver would rarely have to take manual control of the vehicle. The driverless car is a pinnacle of safety that would keep the drivers safe despite the self driving aspect. The cars have an advanced sensor that would respond to driving accidents far better than a human could. If their was a train that was accelarating faster than a cheetah, the self driving car would respond by braking sooner and quicker than the average human ever could. The driverless car is an advanced technology that would protect drivers and safely get them to their destination. Their is no need to fear these vehicles, the reason being that they have a faster reaction speed than humans could ever develop. The future will be awfully bright when these cars get on the road and drive themselves. Driverless cars are a great invention and should have a supported development in the future.","We as Americans have the right to vote for who we want to be president.  American citizens should be able to vote directly for the president, not for a state of electors.  This is why we need to abolish the Electoral College.  It is unreasonable, unfair, and unreliable to the people.  In recent times, the Electoral College has been known to have made mistakes on purpose and on accedent.  The Electoral College system that they have going now is very unorganized and needs to be changed.  It is about time that we change the way our citizens vote for our president.  This is a huge deal to our country considering the fact that the president is one of the most important people in the country.  We as American citizens should be able to trust that our vote was for the candate they chose. First of all, lets discuss the past issue that have happened withe Electoral College system.  The incident in 1960 with John F. Kennedy was a huge disaster.  As said in source 2 ""...The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.""  This is a perfect example of how the Electoral College is a misused way of voting.  They tried to basically sabatage Kennedy's election.  What about other problems that also occur with this system?  The voters can't always control who their electors vote for.  The confusion is a big key factor in the situations also.  voters can easily get confuse about the electors and they will accidently vote for the wrong candidate. The peoples rights.  Dont they have a right of who becomes president?  They should.  The Electoral College is taking away from the excitement of getting to make a huge decision on who will run the country.  When a teenager finally becomes eightteen, what do you think is on their mind?  Freedom.  And part of getting their freedom is getting to vote for their country.  The people should have the right to vote for whoever they may choose and trust that it went for the person they chose and not to a state of electors to vote for them.  It's in the facts that more people prefer to have a direct election.  The people think that it is unfair to their rights and we all believe that it is not the best way to decide who runs our country. Organization is a key factor in this country.  So why aren't we showing it?  The voting system that we use to this day is very unorganized and has many flaws.  The Electoral College is much to confusing of a system that we need to be using.  We need to change our system now while we can before we hit another mistake.  We need to take advantage of the freedom that we have in this country of ours and make a difference.  We can change this system so it is much easier and more reliable to vote from. The people want it, so it's about time that the government stands up and agrees with us on that point.  We can change our disorganization. Our country needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  I have discussed the problems our country has faced with Electoral College system, and hopefully it changes your view on what really is the right and better thing to do for our country.  Voting is a very big deal here in America and it is one of the ways it shows we have freedom.  The voting system would be much more organized if the system were changed to direct vote by the people.  That is the right way.  Its about time we change the system for the better.    ","As a student, one of the worst situations is one where an assignment is given that is unclear, vague, or otherwise difficult to understand. Completing projects is usually a laborsome enough activity on its own, but when the question or prompt is incomprehensible, it turns a small hill of a task into a mountain of one. Too many students have been in this situation and know what it is like to be immeasurably confused and frustrated because the assignment is too difficult to interpret. To make matters worse, students quite often do not know how to contact their teachers during the summer, so they are given no help or clarity as to what they are supposed to do. To avoid this, as well as a multitude of other issues, summer projects should be designed by the students, because they understand how to design the project to make it more ideal, it will allow the students to have more control over which direction the project is taken, and it would also benefit the teachers by stopping them from having to do even more work. Different people can take different pieces of information away from the same things. Sometimes people will pick up on completely different parts of text than others would. This should not be an issue, but when a teacher is pushing for students to make a project from one angle or perspective, it could prove very restricting since they did not form the same viewpoint on the information. By designing their own projects, students could eliminate this obstacle and just create something based on what they took away from their learning. This would help students to be much more creative and would allow them to properly highlight what they learned. One could argue that this is counter intuitive since students would not all have the takeaway the teacher wants them to gain, but summer projects are once again just about assuring that students are learning and usually not followed up on as true assignments. The question of if a student learned the same thing as everyone else should not be as important as them just learning something relevant in general. Giving students control over what they do for a summer project could greatly benefit their learning. By requiring them to design the project themselves, students are then also required to step up to the plate and be more responsible and creative. Learning to develop these characteristics is far more important than any history or science lesson their project may be on. As stated earlier, summer projects are usually not followed up on, making students even more likely to forget what they learned about from them. And at the very least, making the projects student-designed would save teachers from having to do it themselves, which they would most likely appreciate since they are already given enough work as is. ","There is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other. The Facial Action Coding System. They put a imagine of Mona Lisa Smile. In the applications called FACS knows how she is like how happy you are or angry. But with her they got a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. In the software is the latest innovation from prof. There is Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advanced Science at the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof. Also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express , and how we feel. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. And the facil expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang. Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly. With Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. They are 3 things while you are looking in the mirror 1 is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth, 2 is squinting yours eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and 3 is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. Towars your eyes. The facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. All that is about science or technology. I think the application is smart because it show's you how you are in the moment.","By the author of this topic is really persauding by true facts where it makes u think. Can we really live on venus the normal way or a new way? During all this time all the best and expert sciencetist are working together to test a method nd see if we can live on that planet without dying or not producing food or water or even shelter. While testing we figured out that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. So that is why I think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us. Even the thought of going to a new planet is a big turn of events because we dont know how its atmosphere works or gravity or air/oxygen or weather climate change or anything but we are learning about it really fast where we have to make a high expert group of people to risk their lives to see if we can produce our species or our tech,food,citys, or even animal life in conculsion to make sure that we sure we dont make the smallest mistake to screw up the plans for us to live or visit venus in future but in mean time we have people training to become the best of the best for this secret peoject if it happens. So that is all i gotta say and i hope it does happen to make history on the board for people to live on a new generation. So our main goal is all about Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Even NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers","You should, participate in the seagoing cowboys program because from luke's point of veiw it seems fun.

Another reason why you should join the seagoing cowboys program' you get to see differnt kinds of people. the text also stats it made me more aware of people of other countries and their need. Also it will make your family to host. The text stats and that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

764,220,"The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it. Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government. Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage. The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a ""winner-take -all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat. Everything that is rong with the electoral collage. Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.    ","The author explains to us how worthy it is to study Venus for example in the articel he claimes that Venus has so many features like earth for example like an ocean or a mountain he alos said there could even be some type of life form that could live there. There has been more and more people wanting to study this because of the fact that this one day might become another earth that we can live on and form some type of life on there but people have to test it out to see if we are able to live there for example to see if any animal life form can live there or even start bringing other to Venus for some testing. The big issue though is that the tempture gets really high like around 800 degrees for example it siads that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volecanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightn skrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" For example in paragraph 5 it saids "" The National Aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Vesusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of there way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface , temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful,and radiation would notexceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans."" l","The advantage of limiting car usage is that we get to save the world because less cars are used. As less the better because gas its bad for earth. 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy and by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something thats too easy and says, ""Hahaha you really thought you could do that, thats to easy your gonna have to do more if you want to do that!"" I'm getting off topic. The reason people ask more than one person for advice is because like I said its too easy so asking more than one person you can have different opinions but eventually you will get they same answer more often then you have what you should do, just don't ask old people or they will give you a story and it will be long and boring. There you go a essay telling you how asking for help from multiple people, can give you multiple opinions and which ever one you get you get more of the same answer and you us that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying ""finally that kids gone"". But as I was saying, ask multiple people for help, not just one. Asking one is just plain stupid, but asking multiple will give you multiple reasons why you should go with that answer. Think of it like this, if you ask multiple people for help with idk ask out your crush, most of them tell you to be casual and to not get nervous, so what are you going to choose, the one that you got most of the same answer.","Imagine that you are at our old middle school. There's a club that you are just dying to join, but you are too nervous to, One day, the principal comes onto the intercom and says: ""as of today, all students must be part of an extracurricular activity."" Finally, an excuse to join that club! This scenario is one that many students dream of, but a reality for few. Therefore, I believe that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies. First off, mandatory participation for extracurricular activities can help boost social skills for students. Many students suffer from social anxiety, and ""having any sort of extracurricular activity in a child's life can majorly boost the development of social skills due to working with others, especially in the 10-16 year old range,"" according to an article by psychologist Kathryn Wilson. This means that if children participate in extracurricular activities with peers, then they will most likely develop friendships with said peers. Another reason for enforcing mandatory participation for extracurricular activities is that they can help students cope with depression. Everybody has something they like to do, and there is almost always other people who enjoy the same thing. According to a study performed by Stanford University students in 2018, 93% of students who had been diagnosed with depression reported feeling ""happier and more energetic"" after spending time with people who had similar interests as them. This means that spending time with like-minded people can help students combat depression. Finally, participation in extracurricular activities should be mandatory because they can help students find new hobbies. For example, pretend that you are a student who has always wanted to fly a drone, but never has had the chance to. By joining a flight club, you could experience flying a drone, and possibly develop a new hobby! In fact, according to a survey done by Scholastic in 2017, 96 out of 100 students who joined a new club found out that they enjoyed the club! This means that 96% of students who joined a new club were able to find a new hobby. However, some people believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory. They say that some students prefer not to participate in an extracurricular activity. To test that, a group of William and Mary University students went to 3 different middle schools and asked every 8th grade student whether or not they would like participation in extracurricular activities to be mandatory. Afterwards, they took the 152 students who said no due to not wanting to have to participate in an extracurricular activity and asked them to join an extracurricular program of their choosing for one week. After the week, every single student who said that they did not want to participate in an extracurricular activity changed their minds. Ultimately, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, as they can help to boost social skills, cope with depression, and develop new hobbies. After reading this, I strongly encourage you to go out and find a group of people with similar interests as you, be it online or in person. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it!","People are planning to make driverless cars thanks to thee technology we now have. However, how are you going to teach your children how to drive when these cars come out? How are they going to get their license if they don't know how to drive? Lets not forget that technology can also malfunction at any time. People have been talking about creating driverless cars and have those be the cars of the future. Right now there are many teenagers learning how to drive. They want to be able to pass the test to get their permit/license. If the cars were to come in now, there would be no point in teaching them how to drive if the cars do it for them. There is a small point while driving where the driver actually has to drive themselves, but that would be hardly ever depending on the situation. Money is also another situation on our hands. These cars aren't just made of scrap. They need the high-end technology that the car would need in order for the dream to be accomplished. That technology comes with a price. It stated in the story that there was a device named Radar that was placed on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars itself. That's more than buying a single car that is set and ready for you to buy yourself. The technology used might be high-end, but it also isn't perfect. There can be a malfunction at any time with the sensors and everything that's mentioned in the text. Technology isn't always a reliable source for everyone. There can always be a glitch, and everything blows over. What would happen if the car were to malfunction, and that was to cause an accident? That definitely wouldn't be a good thing. These are a few reasons as to describe my position as against driverless cars. People wouldn't be able to learn how to properly drive a car, money doesn't grow from trees in order to help create these cars, and technology isn't our best source when anything can happen to it. Although it may seem cool to have those cars come in the future, not everything is as it seems.","Phones and Driving Technology has taken the world to new heights in numerous ways. The invention of cars being able to take us places quicker than a horse proved that anything could happen. Mobile phones grew just as popular and took over the world with their unfathomable functions, designs, and capabilities. The way that people are so heavily into their phones and the problem with not having good drivers on the road or when those are combined make driving a combo that no one wants to see. The usage of phones should not be allowed while driving by any means necessary. Phones divert people's focus and show that we are easily engrossed in them, being sidetracked is one of the things that are not needed on the road. The distractions of phones cause people to bump into things from household to public and it shows that staring at a phone is too much for most humans to multitask. If a phone is needed for directions, then it should be set before driving or placed upon a stand of some sort on the dashboard of the car so that looking down for a long period of time does not lead to danger. In addition, texting can be held off and can be answered by simply pulling over to check rather than be a hazard on the road by taking either one or two hands off of the steering wheel. Using a phone while driving has caused many to be severely injured or has led to the death of the driver, passengers, the people in the other vehicle, and/or unsuspecting pedestrians. There is no justifiable reason for someone to use their phone, the lives of few or many can be affected by someone's foolish actions. Others should not have to pay the price of someone else's actions by suffering from serious injuries, losing someone they love, or even worse their life. In summary, the temptation to use a phone while driving should be taken away by turning the phone upside down or turning the phone off until the destination is reached, a music playlist should already be made in advance so that skipping an unwanted song does not happen. Commercials and ads should be increased and tell the consequences in a slightly harsher way and to get people to truly understand how much people value their life just as much as they do theirs. Phones should be needed to connect to cars to turn the phone off or through that way people tell of the message that is received. All in all, people should just stop using their phones while driving and should just think about others around them. 2            ",,,,,,,
161,220,"Dear Principal, I disagree with changing to grade scale to play sports. I don't have a B average in school that is why i have chosen to go against this idea. A lot of student-athletes don't have a B average either. This would cause a lot of us not to be eligible to play the sports we enjoy to play. This would also lead us to losing a lot of our games and nobody like to be on a losing team. So this would drop participation of sports and make them not as fun as they could be. Playing sports is a social time for students and it lets them get to know each other better. They are also help with exercise which a lot of kids don't get. It allows students to have something to look forward to after school. Sports are very important to students. I do agree that students have to put school before sports. I think because a C is the average that's what i would expect out of some students. Other students who have a B or a A Average that the should be expected to hold that grade if they want play sports for the school. These are my thoughts on the grade change. Sincerely, Student","In early June of every year, students around the United States sigh in relief at the end of the school year. No longer trapped by stuffy classrooms and long extracurriculars, students have time to enjoy summer with their friends and family. But this summer is not a full vacation. Many students are required to prepare for their classes in the next year by completing at home summer projects in a variety of subjects. In deciding the design of such projects, summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to instill discipline among the children and improve the quality of education during the school year; while some may argue students will be more engaged if they can design the summer projects themselves, the freedom received by creating one's own project could actually leave students disinterested with a topic mattter they know little about. Receiving teacher designed projects, and not giving students the freedom to design their own, will instill discipline among the children that is needed to be successful in the coming year. While it may be unfair to impose a project only decided by teachers, this unfairness is consistent with the method of which projects and tests are given out during the school year. A student who expects student autonomy in an advanced class with a lot of content may be fustrated and even resentful towards a teacher who tries to implement teacher-designed projects during the school year. Thus, students may not be disciplined enough to listen to their teachers and do what is expect of them if they have such a different mode of learning during the school year. Furthermore, it is especially important students understand and get used to the rigor of advanced classes such as Duel Enrollment and Advanced Placement classes, which put high demands on the students from the beginning to the end of a year. Difficult classes, like Advanced Placement, are often required to give out several tests and projects of a specific regulation or design, as per the exam that students are expected to take at the end of the year. Failing to model the specific design expected in the advanaced class would do a diservice to the students who are taking end of year exams, and may even lead to lower scores. Most importantly, giving teachers control over summer project ensures that they know exactly how educated each student is on the subject matter and will not have to waste time repeating material that could have been taught during the summer. Student-designed summer projects will often veer towards a student studying a topic of their own choice; thus, their peformance on such a project will only give insight on their capabilities in that subject and leave the teacher clueless as to what else the student may or may not know. For example, a student-designed summer project in calculus may have the student practice and research taking a derivative. A teacher will be able to judge this student's abiity in differentiation. However, the teacher will have no understaning of the student's ability to integrate or sum series, which are two equally crucial concepts of calculus. By relying on the student to design his summer project and, by extension, his preparation for a class, the teacher will be ill informed on the actual strengths and weaknesses of his or her students. This will have adverse effects on the quality of education during the school year, because the teacher may waste time teaching concepts students need no help in and failing to spend more effort teaching concepts students overwhelmingly struggle in understanding. The quality of education may suffer in other areas as well if students were to design their summer projects. Since elementary school, I remember many teachers complaining about how summer is when students' education goes down the drain. Without the presence of teacher instruction or even projects to complete, students often fail to retain information of the previous school year. Consequentially, teachers gripe, for good reason, that they spend the first quarter of the new year reteaching old information. With teacher control over summer projects, students will be forced to renegage witth all the material the teacher expects them to know before returning to school. Students will not have such a large gap of instruction during the summer and, thus, will be able to learn more information at a deeper level during the school year, improving the quality of their education as a whole. Others may argue that giving students autonomy over their summer projects will make them more engaged with the material for the school year, but too much freedom may lead to a lack of understanding and excerbate disinterest with the subject matter. A student required to make a project about introduction to world history will probably not know much about the subject during the summer; thus, he or she will be more likely to feel lost and anxious about having to create such project. The student may only research the topics he or she already understands, say American history, and neglect researching the roman empire or hundred years war that will make up most of the material in the class. Thus, the student has not grown in interest for the class, but has remained stagnant in both understanding and engagement with the new material of the year. Also, he or she may feel overwhelmed and cheat or simply turn in a project of bad quality in response to such a demanding project. Instead of fostering engagement, throwing students into the deep end of a class with little teacher instruction may actually scare students from taking the class in the coming year. Teacher-designed summer projects will provide the school the opporutunity to prepare students for their best chance of success in advanced classes and to teach students more information at a deeper level. These projects are schools' best hope in ensuring students do not sweat out all their knowledge in the summer heat. ","If I was asked to go for driverless cars or against it, I would be against it. Yes I know we're at the point when technology is used for everything, but I believe that the use of technology can be harmful to us. I'll give you four reasons why I am against driverless cars. It will affect our skills about cars, how it's function. Second, teenagers or anyone won't learn how to drive. Third, it might be dangerous because of the weather. Fourth, the driving laws can be changed. If we had driverless cars, how are we going to learn or know about them? We can't always learn from technology. There is going to be new engines and everything, but I bet we can't learn about it that quickly. It took more than 60 years to understand this cars. We cant just throw all that away. How are we going to teach teenagers how to drive if we have driverless cars? We won't be teaching them nothing, except to just put itself to drive. I bet teenagers want to learn how to drive on their own or from their parents, without the use of technology. The weather can cause many destructions. If your car is destroyed because of the weather, you are able to fix it with different parts. It may be expensive, but imagine the new technology ","Do you think that Venus is worth exploring? Well in the story, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" it tells you how scientists are trying to explore Venus. Venus is called the,""Evening Star,"" because of how we can see it as the brightest point in the night. Venus is also, a planet that no human can survive on; the planet is hot, and has high pressure. The conditions far more dangerous than any human has done on earth. However, the challenge of finding what this planet has and, how it can help us on earth. Has made scientists want to find out about this more. Imagine someone has finally, found something on Venus; everyone would be amazed by it. That is why they want to find out about Venus even if it dangerous. Although, Venus is a planet that we can not land on without burning. Scientist have reason on trying to find out about this planet. For example, Venus is referred to Earth's ""twin,"" because it has the same density, size, and closest to earth,even if something we are closer to Mars, because of the speed of the earth. However, because Venus is more like earth scientist think that their is a posibility that is we might need to move to another planet. Venus might be the better option than any other planet. That is why scientist want to know. All in all, even if scientist think it's impossible to find something about Venus, they will try and figure out. It might be hard but, I believe that people like challenges. Even if we can not there might something they can do, like make a robot that can stand hot and high pressure. ","Asking multiple people for advice can really pay off. The majority of people consult more than one person before making a decision. This can really help them to make the best choice possible. Whether you take their advice or not, asking multiple people can never hurt or harm you. Asking multiple people for advice is fantastic because you can get more ideas, they can help you decide what is the best choice for everyone around you, and they can assist you in making the overall best choice or decision. Asking for multiple people's opinions and advice is awesome because it can give you more ideas. When talking to different people they all might have different ideas of what you should do. Even though it may seem a bit daunting, having a lot of ideas can never hurt you. It can only help you make the best choice possible. Maybe you thought you should do something one way but then your friend, coworker, or even teacher has another way you should do something. Nine times out of ten we think something can only be done one way. Our vision can be clouded but other ideas can help to clear our vision just a little bit. One day we all will have to make a decision or choice that will affect others around you. That choice might be weighing on you, dragging you down until it is finally made. That choice might be a difficult one but asking others can help relive the stress of that decision. If the choice evolves or affects other people it can be hard, but asking those around you can always help you. Say you get invited to two sleepover parties on the same night and you don't know which one to go to, ask your parents or ask friends that might be going to the sleepovers for their advice. Having multiple people you can get advice from can be a ginormous game changer. That decision that is grinding you down can easily be lifted away if you ask for multiple people's advice. Getting advice from multiple people can help you make the overall best choice. People always have different ideas of how things should go, but getting more than one person's opinion can help you to narrow down the options until you have found the final, best choice. One hundred percent of the time you ask for more than one person's advice you find the answer you were looking for so much faster. Different people with different backgrounds can have amazing advice that can totally change the way you think. The advice could be something you never even thought of. We love thinking we are doing everything right, but getting advice from multiple people can help show us how we were wrong. More importantly it can show us how to do something better. The advice givers can also help guide us to the best answer. When you receive advice from multiple other people the best piece of advice typically finds a way to you. Multiple pieces of advice can be magnificent, but they can also confuse you until you have no idea what is right or what is wrong. That is why it is always best to work with others, and receive their advice. Getting multiple people's advice is always worth asking because it can give you way more ideas that you didn't even think of, it can help create decisions that are best for others, and they can help you make the overall best choice. Even though it can be difficult asking for advice, it is always worth hearing what people have to say. It is even better when you ask multiple people for their thoughts or advice. Remember that even though you asked you do not always have to take the advice. Even if it is really good advice or if it is terrible advice.","Why does everybody suspect that their is life on Mars when they see a wierd form of rock on it when really it´s nothing like that? Well thats how a lot of people were thinking when NASA revealed the picture of the Face on Mars. However thats not true. NASA has proven in so many ways that it´s just a natural landform, but of course some people think that it´s not natural at all. First, NASA was very suprised to see something like that on the camera of Viking 1 spacecraft. But that went away really fast. ¨Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows made it like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨(2) This tells you that it´s just a natural landform. Not a alien artifact . Also, NASA wanted to go see if it´s a artifact or just a natural lanform. ¨Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.¨(7) This tells you that they never found an alien artifact on April 5,1998. All they found was a natural landform on Mars. Finally, since not everyone was convinced that it was a natural landform, NASA decided to go back and get an even clearer picture of the Martian mesa. This time they used an even stronger camera to show the world that NASA is right.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,¨ he added. ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!¨(11) This can tell you that NASA was trying to tell everyone that their cameras are good enough to spot and see if it´s just a natural landform, so now you shouldn´t be complaning about the pictures. All of this evidence can tell you that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform, not a alien artifact. Their are still a lot of people who think that martians do exist and they will think anything that is not normal on Mars is martian. However there is no martians on Mars. What do you think?        ","How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities. The first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there. Also, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects. Secondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a pain to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for. Finally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class. Forcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.         ",,,,,,,

In this reasonable letter I will be supporting my argument with specific reasons. Feel welcome to not accept my reasonings but i assure you that it will be better to let C students be eligible for playing sports. My number top one reason is that the school will lose popularity do to the fact that students will transfer out to another school in search of a school that accept C students in sports and other activities. The school will lose money but not that much but yeah they will have no more basketball games or any other sport that requires an entrance fee. So I really think that you should consider the policy before you make it official. Another reason to let these students get in sports is that a C is a passing criteria grade point average score. Another reason is that it will help the students out of gang and drug participation, instead they would be in school training or participating in a school activity. So please TEACHER_NAME help the school by accepting C students into sports. It would save you a lot of F students and trouble with the school. You will also be helping out a family in accepting his/or her child into a free sport team instead of struggling to pay a out side of school team which would cost alot of cheddar. I hope this essay has changed your mind, good day to you sir and thank you for taking time to read this.","Have you ever wanted to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program?

","The advantage of limiting car usage is that we get to save the world because less cars are used. As less the better because gas its bad for earth. 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

","Dear Principal, I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school, because some of us may have sick family members or may be sick ourselves. If so then if we are to get sick at school then we may not have a way to contact our parents or legal guardians. or if one of our family members become ill then how will we know unless we are contacted by you or the secretary, and sometimes we just might like to know right very first. For example what if our Grandma had a heart attack and we had no way of knowing?? Or if we need to be some where after school and we can't get to the office phone before the school closes then we may need our phones. But on the other hand I' am kind of against it myself because I have seem many school fights over kids who have cell phones and who don't. It's either the children with phones picking on the children without phones who are to ""poor"" maybe its just that their parents don't want them to have them. Or it's the children without cell phones picking on the ""preps"" for having phones or jumping them to get a-hold of their phones. Also most of the time if you tell a student that they are allowed to bring their phones to school they will more in likely turn them on while you are out of the room or even while your teaching. If you were to give them the privilege of using their phones during lunch and eight period what would that mean could we talk and text or just text? Because that may cause other students to slowly get louder and louder as the time grows on. Also by the meaning of using our phones during school do you mean that we are just allowed to talk and text or are we allowed to get on the internet? Listen to music off of our ring tones? You have to ask yourself this would it cause an even bigger disruption? Plus what are you meaning when you say free time when yall are done teaching? So in all I would have to say that you should tell the students to leave their phones at home. If in case of an emergency then their parents could easily just call the school and have them get their students. STUDENT_NAME      ","Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively. If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the odd ball in the class. With that part of the year and during the summer when not only was I able to catch up in subjects that I was a few grades lower in, but I was a level higher then everyone else for a while. With teachers designing the summer project then students don't have to worry about it as much because they don't have to waste the time deciding what to do for the project all summer. Not only would the students be given a benefit from using the knowledge given to them, but they also get to finish it in almost half the time that they would have needed if they were to choose the project as well. There are a lot of friends that I know who can't decide on a certain subject for a project until it is either the night before it is due or the day off. They are very stressed out when this happens which leads to them failing in other classes as the extra stress from that one class is distracting them from the others. Another benefit is that the student actually has to go out of their comfort zone, or they will stay in it, if the subject or the needed information is in a subject/ topic they like or dislike. Forcing a student to work on something that they don't understand is something that could help them understand it, and as they have to get a understanding before they can use it or they will not understand it and never get any better on the subject; making the student more creative in their methods for learning and for when they overcome harder challenges in life. For Example, they might get into a rut at a job that they have and it is getting difficult to keep going. Well if they are creative thinkers then an idea might pop into their head which could lead to them getting out of the rut and to a much happier life. In conclusion, then if a teacher either from the last year or the next year will be able to help the students understanding grow. Although, some people think that the teacher shouldn't be the one to design it, but in fact the student, because it gives them a free choice on what to do, they have more fun doing it as it might be a subject they are interested in, and they might be able to grow in their field of experiences that interests them. It still could lead to students not doing the summer project at all because they might not be able to decide until the very last moment or not at all. If a teacher or teachers design the summer project then their is a lower chance that the student will forget information from the last year. Along with, the project being a challenge that could benefit both the student and the future teachers in the long term, with the student having a better understanding of the subject and/or the concept.","Phones and driving 2.35 million injuries are from car accidents every year. Of that 2.35 million, 330,000 of these injuries are a result of drivers being on the phone. There are a lot of pedestrians who are hit by cars just because people can't stay off from there cell phone. Some people have families and just want to make it home so they can see their loved ones. You can get seriously hurt from a car accident so please stay off your phones. Being on cell phones have cost many people life changing injuries or even worse. While you are in the driver's seat you shouldn't even have your phone in sight. Don't put your phone on your lap or any place where it can be easily accessed. Just having your phone in arm reach would make you want to pick it up. When you are on the road you should give the road your full attention and do not look at your phone, you might think that it's okay to look at your phone for a second but that one second could make the difference of life or death. People get scars from being in a wreck both mentaliy and physically. Some may not walk again some do walk but with the help of therapy. This can all be simply avoided if we all just stay off our phones. Nobody wants to be crippled for life because they were on their phone. I don't mean to sound repetitive but please stay off your phones, it does nobody no good by being on your phone. Not only are you a danger to yourself by being on your phone but you are also a danger to the people surrounding you. Pedestrians are people who are walking on foot. Our bones are stronger than concrete but that don't matter to a car going 40 miles per hour. When you are in the car driving you must not only think about yourself. You could end somebody's life if you are not careful. Every time you get into that car and you are driving you have two choices to make. You can put the phone down and drive safe or you can be an irresponsible person who care not for the lives of other. People lives are put in danger every day because of car accidents. Do not add to the accidents by making a simple mistake. Put your phone away while you are in the car so everybody can have a safe ride. Humans are fragile and our lives a very precious and should be cherished with every second we, don't let your's end because of a simple device         ",,,,,,,
272,220,"If you was a student at Generic_School what would you say teacher or student designed ? There are those who argue that teachers should design the projects over the summer but this is not true. There is an ongoing debate about weather or not teachers should design summer projects during the break. Although some may disagree, I believe that students should design the projects over the summer. Because, we can make up are own projects, its a good way to keep us remembering things over the summer, and if we could make are own projects up the easier the better. First, we can make are own projects up without someone telling us that we are doing something incorrect. Or they dont like the way that we are doing the project . An they want us to do it how they want it and they want it how they prefer it to look . Its better for me to think of something that wont give me a hard time to do. I wont be stressed out about it because my teacher didn't explain to me what to do specifically. These are some reason why students should design there own summer project. secondly, If we make are own project up its easier and its better because its me making up my own project. Teachers might try to give us an project on a subject that i might be struggling in or having a hard time with. But its also, good practice for sols and other things like tests an it will also guide you through the summer. It wont be as challenging as it would have been if the teachers would have designed projects for the summer. An if we dont complete this over the summer it would reflect on us. Because we where told we could come up with are own type of project long it was a school related and a subject. Although some may disagree, I believe that students should be allowed to design there own projects during the summer. An i have many reasons and examples to support why students should be allowed to design there own projects. I also have my reasons why teacher should not be allowed to design are projects for us in during the break. There are some that argue that students should be allowed to design there project this is true.","Quick question can you remeber your first time behind the wheel, blood rushing from all the excitement from this new experience. So nervous but so anxious, filled with fear that you can't help but to embrace. Boy what a rush, but what about those who haven't had that experience yet? I guess that's one thing we forgot to stop and think about hmm.. That's because when it's outside of ourselves it doesn't really faze us. Sure taxi rides are fine at times but it would get old and boring sooner or later with out a doubt. So driverless cars are not really what I think we need at this point. Driverless cars seems like a fun futuristic type of thing so I understand why people would want them , not to mention that in certain situtation could be lovely to have. Why wouldn't you want a driverless car you may ask. Well First off the price of one of these machines cost up to two hundred million dollars and I know for a fact I can't afford this and neither can lots of others in this world .There is also things that just don't add up, we have been told nothing about warrinties or how any payment go, do you get the same insurance as you did with a regular vechicle, and if something breaks or goes wrong and your injuired or injure someone else who's to blame. The text even ask it's self "" If the technology fails and someone is injuired' who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"". If that's not a clear cut reason of why these are nothing but a risk then I don't know what is. People can be put at fault for an accident that they had no control over at all because the car drives its self, therefore its like a game of Russina roulette you never know whats gonna happen or who will be blamed. In conclusion to some of these terrible possiblitles I still take into consideration that everything right now is just he said she said no one really has proof that it will shut down and cause accidents or if it will even cost two hundred million by the time it comes out. But there are some things we do know and that is that in : California, Nevada, Florida, and District of Columbia it is illegal to have even semi-automatic cars and changing laws for something unproven is highly doubted. As of now it sounds safer for a driver to be paying full attention to the road then to be in a unpredictable driverless car where anything could happen, safety comes first. So for the sake of the people who haven't had a chance to experience their first time behind the wheel and for the safety of all on the road driverless cars are a no in my book.","The Seagoing Cowboys is a program, and its main goal is to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

Students would not have any sort of distraction from other students. After finishing the online class for the day students would have more time to do what they need to do at home or at work, There is a possibility that students could struggle by not getting face to face help from a teacher. Students could benefit from attending online classes because they would not have any distraction from others around them and afterwards would have more time to focus on things at home; however, it could get hard by not getting the help they want from an actual computer during any time of the day. First, students would focus more on their selves with no one around to bother them. At public schools students would make many friends, which is not a bad thing, but would be too distracted to do what they need too get done. For example, students with mental issues and any sort of problems could take online classes rather than dealing with kids at school who could cause them not to do their work. Sometimes kids do not like having so many other students around them and decide they think it would be better to stay at home and take their classes where they find it more comfortable the most. Some students may like the idea of staying home and doing online classes and others may feel the total opposite and want to go out, but they should know it would have a better outcome for their selves. Secondly, after students take their classes online they would have more time than they would going to a public school. when finishing the classes the students can do whatever they needed to to at home, or if they have work. For example, some students may have a really good paying job and would rather focus more on that then going to a public school that would take up most of their day. Some students might have to do chores at home, or have to help with family every day. Students should have more time out of their day to do things that they enjoy to do and what they need to do rather than spending more than half of their day sitting in a classroom. On the other hand, there are students who need more of a face to face help than only getting the contact they need from a person through a device. The student and teacher and or computer, may only have a limited time to receive help. For example, teachers who have kids at home would have to limit their time with a student so they can take care of their own kids. Students may not get all the information that they need by staying online than by getting it in person. Sometimes students would not want to have to stay at home while not enjoying taking online classes and would prefer to stay in school and get the help and information they need. Finally, students should take online classes even if they do not think it would help them. Staying at school can cause them to stay distracted by their friends and everyone around them. Students would enjoy the extra time at home to do what they need. When not able to get the face to face help during anytime of the day could be a struggle that they would have to pass. Students would be able to benefit from online classes because they would not have any distraction from others and afterwards students would have more time to focus on the things they need to do at home or at work; however, it could become hard by not getting face to face help during anytime of the day.","The electoral college is a process where electors are sent to choose who the next president will be. Electors usually vote for who they said they were going to but can change this vote. I think we shouldn't have the electoral college anymore because, The people don't get to actually choose who they want to elect and voters can change who they're going to vote for. The people who are voting for their president they wanted elected arn't actually voting for him. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" This means that even if the president gets the popular vote, it doesn't mean he will always win. Electors can and will avoid the states that they know are not going to vote for the person they want to win the elections, and will avoid those states. In source two, it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" Sometimes the voters don't even get to see the electors they're voting for and some states don't get them at all. The electors also purposley avoid certain states because they know that they won't vote for them or give them a chance to swing the election. Voters can also change who they're voting for on the spot and no one can say or do anything about. In source two, it says ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" People voting for who the wanted to win the election could be accidently voting for someone else because of the electors work. The elector shouldn't be allowed to change his vote, because that is cheating people out of who they think should win and making it seem like their vote didn't even matter. Some states also have more electors than others, making it so that the person one state votes for will get more votes than the other states. Some people think that electoral college system should still be there. Source 3 says, ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Even if the electors that are selected and its said that the trust is rarely betrayed, the electors can still betray the person they're voting for and it can happen and it has happened before. It also doesn't say anything about the electors avoiding states that they know won't vote for them and going to states that can swing the election. In conclusion, people don't get to vote for who they want to and electors can do basically whatever they have to do to win. People vote for the president they want to win and can be cheated out of that by the electors. The electors are allowed to move from a state they think won't vote for them to one they think will. The electors can also change who they're voting for during the elections. The electoral college is a system that cheats voters out of who they want to vote for and seems like a outdated and non-democratic method.    ","I do not think individuals should have the right to use a cellular device for any reason none whatsoever while driving vehicles. Driving while engaged in any activity that could divert a persons attention from the primary task of driving. Distracted driving can fall under 3 different categories which are (visual: taking your eyes off the road), (manual: taking your hands off the wheel.), and (cognitive: taking your mind off what you are doing). The Harvard center of risk analysis shows a study of that estimates cell phone use while driving contributes to 6% of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries and 2,600 deaths each year including a tab that is $43 billion . Activities that can be distractive are cellphone usage, eating, drinking, reading, changing the radio station, doing makeup, doing hair, talking to passengers in the car. The reason why I chose this is because during the year there are 1.6 million crashes each year. Although, nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. The other reason why I chose this decision is because when you send or read a text message, you take your eyes off the road for about 5 seconds, long enough to cover the length of a football field while driving at 55 mph. However, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States I caused by cell phone usage. Approximately, each day in the United States 9 people are killed more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to be involved by a driver distracted by their cellular device. During the past years there have been 1.6 million car crashes each year. The people that text while driving are 23 time more than likely to have a car wreck and pass away. However, texting while driving take your eyes off the road for 5 seconds at a time which means your eyes are of the road for a distance of 300 feet. Although, many people in the world expects a reply from a total of 2-5 minutes which puts tremendous pressure on them that makes them want to respond faster. However, 60% of drivers admit to using their cellphones while driving. 3,328 people were killed and 421,000 people were injured in accidents involving distracted drivers in 2012. Even though you don't think about it but texting increases your crash risk to 23% more than when not distracted. In the United States automobiles are a way of life and car accidents are an inevitability. Although, teens think it is so important to text while driving 143 million that communicate daily, there's no doubt that car accidents are bound to happen to be no end in sight. Yearly roughly 1.3 million people die from worldwide car accidents. There is an average of 3,287 deaths per day. From the age of 15-44 they are responsible for all road traffic deaths. Most fatal crashes led to 37,461 total fatalities, including 25,096 vehicle occupants, 5,286 motorcyclists, and 7,079 nonoccupants. The ages 16-19 year old has the higher risk of motor vehicle crashes. However, 15% of drivers ages 15-20 involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year. While on the other hand on average 3,287 deaths a day. However, 20-50 million people are injured during car crashes.       ","Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was looking for somwhere to land on Mars for Viking 2 when it sppoted a showdow that looked like a face. The enoemous head was nearly two miles from end to end. The facewas just a natural landform. Only few scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact. But the article states that when NASA unvieled the image for all to see, the caption that went with it noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembled a human head... formed by shadows giving an illution of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also in the article it says the author even reasoned ""it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars"". The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon. On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument. Of course not everyone was happy. It's much cooler to have it be a alien artifact than a natural landform. People weren't giving up. The face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bored of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the alein markings were hidden by haze. Mission controlers prepared to look again. The article states that ""we just don't pass over the face very often"". On April 8, 2001, it was acloundless summer day; the Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you could easily see if there were shacks or small airplanes. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. These are landforms common around the American West. This all proves that the so called ""Face on mars"" was just a landform and not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the landforms made it appear to look like a face but it was just a cauincedince.

107,220,"Students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. First of all, this will let students be less stress from going to school and receiving their education. Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing enviroment which I think works best. Lastly, this would give students more free time for themselves and choose whatever they want to do what they can't do during the day. Most students around the United States dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proccess of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The bus is going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online classes that benefit students from going to school and taking the classes online. I think this would help all students from stress becasue you won't have to think about early morning wake ups. This would help students not having to deal with overloads of work stressing about ""where did I put my papers"" and losing valuable homework. This also helps with time management. Students won't have to go to school for more than 7 hours and be stuck in class sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there classes online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teachers about who's right and who's wrong. In addition, students would benefit even more becasue they would work at there own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and won't be rushed by and teachers or anybody. I think this is a great way for students to build self-indepence for the real world becasue they will be on there own and have to manage there time wisely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the you can choose a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students don't have distractions. Students can also engage with other students if they taking the same materials and help each other out. Moreover, this allows students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students these days want to have some change in there pockets and find partime jobs. This would allow students to either choose a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they won't be physically at school. Most students can join a sport they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. I would reccomend many schools should have online classes for students who just dont feel school isnt where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel. ","Summer would be a lot of fun if students were able to design their own projects. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. One may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed. However, summer projects should be student-designed because, students will learn more, students will feel accomplished, and lastly students will be prepared for life as adults. Students will enjoy their summer and their projects if they were allowed to design it. Students will learn more from their projects if they designed it! They would put more thought into their projects which expands their learning. A lot of of thought goes into designing a project. Students will have to plan out and organize their projects, which takes lot of learning! Students will learn more from working, on a project, on something that interests them. There is way more excitement and joy on learning when it is something in their interest. Rather then doing a topic a teacher wants students to do, students should be allowed to do a topic in their interest. Learning should not always be hard. These summer projects would be easier for students do on a topic they enjoy learning about! Students will enjoy learning more If summer projects are student-designed. There is nothing better then seeing a student feeling accomplished on a project they designed. Students will feel accomplished on their work. It will boost up their self esteem. They will have more confidence knowing they designed that whole project on their own. Students will take pride in their work. Students will be proud of themselves, not only will students be proud but parents, and teachers will also be proud! Students will also feel motivated to continue outstanding work just like that on any other projects in the future. It is a great feeling to have students feeling accomplished in their work and not just something a teacher designed for them. Students will feel as if they can do anything! Student-designed projects will prepare them for the real world as adults! As a teacher, their goals should always be to prepare students for adulthood! Students will be challenged to think outside of the box for their projects. The fact that the project is student-designed will push students to be creative with their projects, and also its gives them a challenge. Students will also learn how to be under a little pressure. Designing a whole project takes a ton a work and will have students under a little pressure. It will defiantly be good practice for the future in their careers. Students will learn how to plan and organize things on their own. While designing a project, there will be planning and organizing that comes with it. Which also prepares them for the future. In life there will be a lot of obstacles which includes lots of planning and organizing. From their projects they gain a lot of practice and tips that may help in the future. Students earn way more then just a good grade, They gain lots of knowledge that may help for adulthood. In conclusion, students gain much more than just a high five or a pat on the back from designing their own projects. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. One may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, students will learn more, students will feel accomplished, and lastly students will be prepared for life as adults. Students deserve the chance to show out their skills and show what they can bring to the table! There is a lot a student can show teachers just need to allow them to express themselves .Students will enjoy their summer and their projects if they were allowed to design it.","You are going to hear different anwsers from all types of people with different opinions on a lot of things, when you ask multiple people for advice on something you can find out new and better ways to solve a problem, therefore you can get a greater understanding of whatever your seeking advice for. After you have gathered different advice from people you should make a better choice then the one you thought before you asked those people for advice. Asking advice alone is a good idea but when you ask a bunch of people you also can obtain a lot of knowledge from that individual that could stick with your for a while. after a bit it gets stuck in your brain and you get to add on to your already known knowledge to make it even greater than what it already was. You also get more mature and find the better choice of any situation, obviously you won't be perfect but you will be better than before for sure. It is most likely that you will find more knowledge by people that are older than you and are more wise. Like your parents you can find advice from both of them, or older siblings. You can go a step further and go find advice from your family, for example your grandparents. the point is the more you ask the better you are off. For example you are trying to figure out which study method you should use in Spanish to succeed. You ask your Spanish teacher and she says that you should use her quizlet that she puts up on Google classroom, because it has a lot of materials. Then you ask your mom for advice and she says she likes it best the old fashioned flashcards. You take in both of those opinions into account and you decide to do the older way of doing flashcards. In the example you can see that I got influenced by both sides and got multiple opinions in this situation, which led me to making my decision. Which was the better choice in the end. Another example is that you don't know what to write about for your essay in English class. you ask your teacher and he says that you should do whatever your passionate about or just like in the section of writing prompts. Your friend tells you to go with the easy way out and get an easy grade on the essay with and easy prompt. You take your English teacher and friend into account and chose your English teachers way of doing the essay and you get a good grade on the essay. As you can see in the example I took advice from both of them and chose the better choice in the end. To conclude my prompt the point is that You are going to hear different anwsers from all types of people with different opinions on a lot of things, when you ask multiple people for advice on something you can find out new and better ways to solve a problem, therefore you can get a greater understanding of whatever your seeking advice for. After you have gathered different advice from people you should make a better choice then the one you thought before you asked those people for advice. Also Asking advice alone is a good idea but when you ask a bunch of people you also can obtain a lot of knowledge from that individual that could stick with your for a while. after a bit it gets stuck in your brain and you get to add on to your already known knowledge to make it even greater than what it already was. You also get more mature and find the better choice of any situation, obviously you won't be perfect but you will be better than before for sure. It is most likely that you will find more knowledge by people that are older than you and are more wise. Like your parents you can find advice from both of them, or older siblings. You can go a step further and go find advice from your family, for example your grandparents. the point is the more you ask the better you are off. So it is important to ask for multiple opinions.  ","To be fair,both the electoral college and a popular vote are good ways to decide an election. Although,a popular vote may have more pitfalls than the latter. The electoral college is definitely the best way to pick a candidate without much confusion. The electoral college may have some down falls too but the benefits out weigh them. A popular vote also has some benefits. In Richard A. Posner's passage In Defence of the Electoral College he states,""The electoral college is not a democratic method it is the electors who elect the president not the people""(source 3 p15). If this was our voting method the people would be choosing the president, not the electors. Plus the people dont even know the electors their voting for. In the passage The Indefensible Electoral College author Bradford Plumer states,""The state picks the electors [and the voters dont even get to pick who the electors vote for]"" (source 2 p 10). Basically the people have no control over who they elect. Indeed there maybe limited control for the people over voting for their canidate;but the electors usually pick whoever the people voted for. The electoral college also is a easier way to decide who wins the election. Theres almost no way there can be a tie in an elctoral vote. Richard A.Posner states,""The winning canidates share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the poplular vote"".""[Even if the popular vote winner wins by a little he wins all the electoral votes]""(source 3 p 15).Which means there is no confusion as to who wins. Not only is the electoral college more organized; but it makes the president have to appeal to many regions of people. Richard A. Posner states,""[Not one region has enough votes to win an election so the president has to be liked by other regions as well]""(source 3 p 19).This means that at least half the country must like the candidate for him to win. Swing states are also important in the electoral college. These states are the ones that really care and study who will be the best president. Another statement from Richard A.Posner states,""[People in swing states decide the election and] are the most thoughtful voters""(source 3 p 20).So the candidate must be trying to make sure they please the people. The people may like a popular vote the best,but the most organized and beneficial way to elect canidates is through electoral college. The electoral college not helps with organizing it helps people know the candidate. They know the candidate because the candidate must go to each region and get to know the people.    ","Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by Aliens. Many Web sites, magizenes and people do not have enough information to correcty assume that the Face on Mars is an Alien monument or creation. Many people just guess without really having adiquite information. We do have enough information to know that when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Mars and took pictures of the Face it was not Alien made. We know for a fact that the Face on Mars is not an Alien creation. The first Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) or the Viking 1 took blurry photos of the Face on Mars and we could not clearly see the object. Twenty-five years later the MGS was sent to take better quality pictures of the Face and when it came back, the photos were ten times more sharper than the Viking 1´s. Now we could clearly speculate that the Face was just another Mars landform. On Earth there are simialr landforms like the Snake River in Idaho. We have found that the Face is a lava dome under the surface of Mars. We understand how much of an influence the Media can have and you shouldn´t believe them. Again, they do not have as much information as we do on the Face on mars. Thanks to our new pictures from the MGS, we can safely say that there is no Alien temple or monument on Mars.        ","Dear Principal, You may think that all students need to perform community service ,but in reality they don't have to if they don't want to. Some students choose not to do community service because they want to do it others probably have things to or they just don't want to do them. You can not make students perform community service hours if they don't want to it is against the law and it's against school policy to make them do something they don't want to do. As me coming from the bottom of my heart you should not force students to do community service hours if they don't want to and if they do fine let them go ahead and do it .You cant make them perform something that they will not be pleased to do unless there parents make them do community service hours, but all in all you can not force students to do community service hours. If you want students to do community service hours you should have a meeting to see how they feel about it and you should tell them how you think it will benefit them because if not its just a waste of time for you trying to get children to do community service hours especially if they already have things to do after school or if they have some type of job awaiting. As a student myself I highly don't think it is fair for you to make kids perform community service hours while there under the impression that it will better help them when in reality you just want them to do it just to do it. Some people already help the community some already clean up the liter so by forcing them to do more community service they are just going to say forget it and that I'm done with this. By forcing students to do community service hours they are going to lose respect for you and they will just blow you off once you ask them to do something or if you ask them to give you something. You should not force students to community service hours if they don't want to at all its just wrong and its mean to force them into something they wouldn't want to do. Sincerely , STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principal, I would like to have policy one enforced in our school. If it were it could help students stay out of trouble during class. Then if as if they were in class and NEEDED to use there cell phone. Then probably they may stay more focused on there work during class if they knew they were allowed to use afterwards. Also that could cause some problems student could get cyber bullied a lot more now, but that might make a big difference in the schools today. So even student may excel using there phones because of the fact say STUDENT_NAME sent a text STUDENT_NAME and said ""Hey was there any math homework"". STUDENT_NAME said ""Yes , it was page 487 number 2 - 20 even and it was all addition problems so there easy."" STUDENT_NAME would say ""Oh well thank you."" A situation like that is helpful, in a way to STUDENT_NAME. that's why policy 1 should be enforced more than policy 2. Overall therefore I would like REALLY like for you to consider policy 1. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
367,220,"Attending clases in online will not be affective compare to taking clases at school. Students focus more in school because teachers are cheking on them all the time. At home students could assealy get distracted by video games or other staffs. Also not all students will take online clases seriously beause it will be more eassy for them to skep classes. Attendding classes at school is more combinent for students because in school students can make friends. Share with new people. In school students can be able to make projects in groups wich they migh not be able to do in online classes. If teachers assing students projects, the school most of the times provides students supplies that they need for projects: like books, computers, and others. Also students can get help from other classmates or from other teachers at school. At school this is a way that makes education more fun and interesting when theres other people around us to help or to get help from them. There are many clases that need to be done fisicly. One of the subjects is P.E class wich is more practical. Another can be sciens classes where students get to learn a lot by doing experiments with chemicals or other materials. For example in biology where students used mycroscophics to learn about cells. This are clases than won't be benefit taking them in online. Because acivities like experiments will not be able to do and theres a lot that students will not going to learn or experimented. School has a lot of opportunities like programs or clubs that online classes won't offert. Academy's are one of the most benefit courses that students can have at school. A lot of students are depending in these courses that Academy's provide. This classes has to be taken in school because there so much that has to be learn by activites in gruop. Also like photography class it would be worthy that students take classes like this in online. This are classes more practicals is not just concepts. Same with art class and music class. In conclution attending classes in online will not be productive as taking classes in school. Because school offerts so much more than online classes. Also School opens a lot of help and clubs and resourse you need for education. Therefor students shoul not choose for attending classes in online because they have more opportunities at school.","Advice is a common piece of knowledge that helps people make decisions. Seeking advice helps people by obtaining wisdom to assist them in making a choice. Advice can come from anyone, in any form. This variety makes advice a unique tool in the situation of making a tough decision. Advice can come from a single person, or a plethora of people. Acquiring advice from multiple people, rather than just one, can help someone make a better and more intelligent choice. Seeking advice from multiple opinions is a great thing to do because of the variety of knowledge and experience of people, different points of views, and the ability to check the different ideas obtained and come up with a central idea of advice. Seeking advice from multiple opinions is going to be different from each person. The variety of knowledge and experience each person has will determine the advice they give. The amount of knowledge or experience each person has accounts for the value and trustworthiness their opinions have. Trustworthiness in advice is key to making a decision. The more knowledge and experience a person has on a problem or situation, the more their advice and opinions can be respected, accepted, and trusted. Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone make a trustworthier choice. Also, the wisdom each person has is determined by their knowledge and experience. Without wisdom, advice wouldn't be trustworthy. The best advice is given by the wisest people. The wiser the opinion is of a person, the wiser and more trustworthy their advice would be. Obtaining advice from multiple opinions can help someone determine the most trustworthy and wise advice, and therefore, make a better choice. The different points of views everyone has is the reason everyone has different opinions. The uniqueness of everyone's opinion is why advice varies from person to person. The variety of opinions and points of views of multiple people can help someone make a better choice after seeking advice. Since advice varies from each person, seeking multiple opinions can give someone multiple reasons to make a decision. Some opinions will be the same too. If opinions are the same, then making an intelligent choice will be much easier. The popularity of an opinion can determine how much weight it will carry when someone is making a decision. When searching for advice, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because the different points of views of people determine how common a piece of advice is. The more common a piece of advice is, the better it can help someone make a choice. Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone come up with a central idea to make a better decision in a situation. Gathering multiple ideas to form a main one is an extremely great way for someone to make a better choice. The various opinions people have can check other peoples advice and determine if it's reliable. Seeking multiple opinions can help find which ideas that match, and which ones are way out of place. Using this information, someone could come up with a central piece of advice which will assist them in making a better choice. Someone could also add up the most reliable or common pieces of advice, and use all of them to help in making a better decision. Using multiple opinions to come up with a central piece of advice, can help someone to make an intelligent and more reliable choice. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. The variety of knowledge and experience of people can determine which opinions are trustworthy, and which ones are not. The different points of views people have can help find the most reliable opinions. Finally, to be able to check other ideas and come with a central idea of advice. This is why seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone make a better choice.                ","Dear state senator, The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. I say this because, as successful as the Electoral College has been, it has many flaws. In the first sentence of the eleventh paragraph, the article mentions something called the disaster factor. This is an alarming possiblity. State legislatures are, in a way, responsible for choosing electors who may ignore the will of the people. During 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, people titled Segregationists almost succeeded in removing the Democratic electors and replacing them with new electors. These new electors were supposed to oppose John F. Kennedy so that any popular votes for Kennedy would not have really gone to him. If those Segregationists had succeeded in their plan, John F. Kennedy would not have won the popular vote. That was indeed a close call, and it could happen yet again in the near future without fail. On another similar topic, ""faithless"" electors have, from time to time, denied the option to vote for their party's candidate. Instead of voting for the candidate of their own party, they cast a vote for whomever they wish. Also occuring in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. Thankfully, he was presiding over the Senate at the time. He made sure to validate the slate of his choosing ""without establishing a precedent."", as stated in paragraph eleven, sentence 9. Hopefully, this will not occur again anytime soon. The most worrying occurance would be a tie. However, if a tie were to happen in an electoral vote, the election would be thrown towards the House of Representatives. There, the state delegations vote on the president. In 1976, a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters from Hawaii had voted the other way. This is bad because the election is only a few voters away from a distaster. In conclusion, the Electoral College is not only unfair, but outdated and irrational. It should be shifted from the way it is now to total amount of popular votes for the president of the United States.    ","community work I have noticed that some of the streets and ground is full of trash. Trash bags, litter, paper, water bottles, plastic, and other stuff. We should stop the littering and everyone should pitch into clean up our earth so creatures like birds, dear, fish, and other animals can flourish. Also if we keep our community clean it will look allot nicer then people would live in the area just because its clean. So i suggest that everyone in the schools fourth grade and up can go to an after school program to help our community. days like Mondays and Tuesdays would be good, or whenever some one sees trash. If every school every person cleans up every community, then i promise we will live in a much beautiful place to call home. Here is some tips on how to keep our community's clean, have a large trash bin on every curve of every house, have trash bins in a park, if you see some trash laying around then pick it up and put it in the trash, if you cant find a trash bin then hold it until you find one. Follow these steps to clean the community clean. Think about this, if every kid in every school cleans up the environment, and if there's 500 kids in each school then that's a whole lot of people helping the community. Imagine all these kids out helping to clean the environment, the streets, parks, community's free of all garbage, wouldn't that be awesome! Not only the schools but if we inspire other people like in churches, think of some of the youth groups that can help to. OTHER_NAME already has something like community work. If every person picks up garbage and follows these rules 1 at a time then trust me, our homes parks nature everything would be allot more pleasant. And it would be amazing if all the people helped to keep community's clean. Wouldn't you agree more?","The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program waiting to happen. I'm Luke and at first, I was unsure about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, but now I'm sure I've made the right choice! Many don't truely know what the Seagoing Cowboys is. During World War II, many animals were sick and had a scarce supply of food in Europe. The UNRRA decided that the needed a special position for horses and cows. That is the Seagoing Cowboys. Some people may wonder about the experience and commitment of the Seagoing Cowboys. It is an outstanding experience for anyone! I get the daily benifit of seeing sights in Europe and China like the Acropolis in Greece. I've also rode a gondola in Venice, Italy! What else is on your bucket list? In addition, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China! Any sea lover or animal lover should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It took a few weeks to travel on the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast to get to China. I attended to the animals and feed them in the ships. Many people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is no fun, all work. You are wrong! We play activites like baseball and volleyball in empty areas. We always enjoy the competative nature of table-tennis, fencing, and boxing when we are off work. Any readers would love to join, as many Seagoing Cowboys love the places a story can take you. Games are a jolly part of any off day with the team. Also, the experience is even more exciting when you bring a friend. Sure, all of the Seagoing Cowboys are your family, but a friend makes the family even closer. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is one of the most rewarding things that has ever happened to me. I believe anyone should be a Seagoing Cowboy if they want. This experience made me get a better grasp on what other countries (and not to metion the animals) need. I hope that ou will be a Seagoing Cowboy because, it is ""hays"" (days) full of fun!","Dear principal, I am writing this letter to you about the new school policies on cell phones. Each policy has their pros and cons, and I want to give you my opinion on which will benefit the teachers and we the students. I hope you take this letter into consideration. I will first talk about Policy 1. Policy 1 benefits the students greatly, we would be able to call and text our friends when we couldn't be together. Some phones even have internet, so we could surf the web on our own free time. Other types of phones have fun games too. Some of the problems of this policy are some students might lose or someone may steal it. That student may blame the school, which would put some pressure on you to change the policy on cell phones. Students could also not turn their phone off and bring it to class. They would text their friends and not pay attention to important topics in class. People that have internet on their phone could look up answers and cheat. I think this policy is good, but could have some problems in the future. Now on to Policy 2. Policy 2 is good for teachers and is ok for students. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids bringing their cell phones to class. Students wouldn't get distracted by their phones at times when they don't need them. They wouldn't have to worry about losing them or someone stealing their phone, and have to waste money on a new one. The cons of this policy is that some students still may sneak their phones and use the features of their phone when the teacher is looking. Some students need to call their parents after school, and without a phone, they don't know where there ride home is. This policy is also good, but no matter which policy, there could be a problem. Out of the two policies, I think Policy 1 is the best. I need my phone everyday so i can call my parents to pick me up after my sports activities. Good students will be thankful that you chose this policy and obey the rules, turning off their cell phones during class time. If a student does break the rules and bring a phone to class, you should confiscate it for a certain period of time. If a student's phone gets stolen or he/she loses it, its their own fault and the school can't be blamed for it. This is my opinion, and i hopes it's yours too, if this policy fails the school, then by all means, try Policy 2. Sincerely, Your Student","It is an innovative idea from may people to cut down on the use of a motor vehicle. in these passages it gives pros on the better enviormental way of living. The first source talks about a city that is in Germany called Vauban, where residents have accepted the challenge of no car usage. The city is designed for walking to department stores, grocery stores, ect. But this so what utopia is not all a utopia itself, where 30 percent of families own cars. Also the United States Enviornmental Proctection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities like Vauban. This action to have a car reduced communites was because of the damage done by cars on the enviornment by pollution. The second and third source is about how a city took matter into their own hands and had a ""car free day"". In the cities of Paris and Columbia is where it took place. First the reasons why is because of near-record pollution of poulltion in the enviornment of Paris. Where on Columbia the reason for the car frre day was because they want to promote alternative transportation and smog. In Coulmbia this day has been going on three years straight! In the last source, it tells about how car culture is ending slowly. In the United States pople have been ""buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" A study shows that driving by young people has decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009. Finally, all these sources have explained that a non motorized vehicle is for the best in our health and in our enviornment. it is a new and innovatied way that is being accepted by a numerous amount of the population.

400,220,"Society is no longer in the era of the stereotypical paper and pencil. New advancements in technology offer a wide variety of options for a student's education. With internet, there are limitless opportunities as far as how and where a student needs to be in order to get a proper education. Home-schooling is a new trend that is gaining more popularity throughout the world each and every day. Other than the people that would be in a school, this system provides the students with all of the necessities that a student would have access to as if they were in a school. Although some may believe home-schooling is a superior alternative, the motivation and socialization that would be present in a classroom would be nonexistent at home. Motivation is a trait that many young adults need more of, whether it is waking up on time for class, or not procrastinating on a school project. Waking up early is something nearly everyone will have to do in their lifetime, so it is better to get used to it while you're still young. If a student has been home-schooled their whole adolescent life, waking up early will be something that they struggle with as an adult. Procrastination is something that many students have a hard time avoiding during the school year. The root of procrastination is a lack of motivation. Part of a teacher's job is to keep the students on task and make sure that they are completing everything in a timely manner. Home-schooled students do not have the availability of a teacher to motivate them and make sure that they are doing their work. It is all up to them if they want to stay on task or fall behind. If no one is there telling the students what to do, they will struggle to find the motivation within themselves. As well as teachers, peers also help to encourage their fellow classmates to stay focused. This leads into the next topic of socialization. High school is a period in one's life where they should enjoy their youthfulness while still working hard in school. It is important to balance the two out as they are equally as important. A school is the central point of socialization, whether it is working together to complete an assignment, or just conversing during your lunch break. Many long lasting relationships are established within a school environment. Home-schooled students cannot relate to in-school students in this sense. Not only is it important to form friendships, but it is also important to get comfortable around large crowds of people. Talking to people is an inevitable fate in everyone's life, this might be giving a presentation at work or publicly speaking in college. While it is a burden to most, starting earlier in life will provide more confidence for when you need it later in life. There are many valid reasons that support the practice of home-schooling. For example, students with social anxiety will be better off in the comforts of home. Students might get anxious around a large crowd for many reasons. For one, self conscious people might get anxious because they think that people are judging them for their appearance. Others might have a hard time building up enough confidence to voice their opinion in front of numerous people. While home-schooling would eliminate the fear of social anxiety, I believe that it is better to face it and get used to it, rather than hide from it. Another reason to argue for home-schooling is because of reduced stress. Some may say that the levels of stress will be greatly reduced in the comfort of home without the constant distraction of other students and the demands placed on students by teachers. While this partially might be true, more stress is caused when a student does not know how to manage their time wisely. Home-schooled students are at a greater risk for this because their are also many distractions at home such as cell phones and social media. Many things are taught in school other than just math, science, history, and language arts. School teaches many important life values that teens will need for when they are an independent adult. Some of these values are impossible for home-schooled students to learn, simply because it is a different environment. Although the idea of home-schooling sounds like the most beneficial option, many people do not realize that home-schooled students have to face their own type of challenges that they will have to overcome. For these reasons I cannot stand for home-schooling. In this case, I will admit that old school beats new school.",Drivers should be able to use phones while driving. Even though texting while driving is against the law people have invented apps and devices that allows you to use the phone without actually holding the phone in your hand they have phone holders and aux cables. Even if your not allowed to hold your phone while driving to change the music or change the call you can now use an aux or voice activated command like siri or alexa. Which would make it safer to use your phone while driving and not having to your phone Most people nowadays still drive while texting on the phone I know my older brother and my God dad do it all the time. I sometimes wonder if im supposed to say something about them driving while on the phone. Using phones while in the car can be a good thing in the since that in case of emergency and you aren't able to reach your phone with your hand you can use voice activation to call the police or fire department. See most people don't take advantage of phone holders while driving because its an hasil to hook to the air vent but if it's going to keep me out of jail I would use one. So in the end cell phones should be allowed to be used in any capacity while operating any vehicle.      ,"Many students love sports and put effort in to doing it, but when a school policy changes many students will argue to let people hear what they have to say. The principal wants to change the policy for students to participate in sports they have to have at least a grade B average. Many students have a grade C average, they are devastated for not being able to participate in sports. I'm going against on the policy change because i would be devastated too, if I could not participate in sports just because I have a grade C. average. To support, I will bring to students to an assembly who admire sports and can not participate in them. Then, do a petition for participating in sports with a grade C average. When my sister started sophomore year, she loved playing sports and doing all kinds of activity. Then suddenly her grades went down, she was so close not to participate in sports. She tried to raise her grades up, but she was stressed. Now, they still let her play unless she keeps her grades up. I want to bring students to an assembly and talk to them how much sports really mean to us. That grades and homework could be our number one priority. That we should still participate in sports with a grade C average. I would want to make a petition, so that students can support our cause and sign it. That its not fair that the things we love to do is being taken away. I think a lot of students and their parents would agree with me. Nothing could stop me from doing the petition. I wouldn't care what the principle or teacher would say. I would keep on pushing and pushing. That's why I'm against the new policy change, because it wouldn't be fair for the student","Generic_Name Generic_Name English 8 HN 3-5-20 How can extracurricular activites be benefical to students? Have you ever wondered why people try excurricular activites? Extracurricular activites are often before or after school or even on the weekends. Some examples of extracurricular actiivities are sports or clubs. I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things. The first reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help boost students mental health. Studies have shown that more excercise is benefical and improves overall mood. Extracurricular activitives,especially sports, have a physical component that gives students the chance to be active. Being active has shown in studies that it improves sleep cycles and overall improves mental health. Being in a extracurricular activity can help boost mental health. The second reason why it would be benefifical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help improve social skills. Making friends doesn't come easy to everyone and joining an activity can give students the chance to meet new people. Joining an extra activity can introduce you to many people who over time, will get to know you and possibly want to become friends. Being a part of an extracurricular activity can help you meet new people and can make it eaiser to make friends or just talk to people in general. An extracurricular activity can help imporve social skills. The third reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can give students the chance to try new things. All activites have a main focus like soccer or art club, but all activites have a little thing they do that is unique. Having the chance to be part of a club is a new thing in itself and you should take advantage of that try a new thing. Being in an extracirricular activity can give students the chance to try new things. In conclusion, I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things. School is a chance to try new things. So take advantage of the oppurtinites that you are given to try something and see how it goes. So how can you take advantage of extracurricular oppurtinites?","""Mom im going to go outside to get some fresh air"" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean. Its polluted. But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air. China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission. But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct. Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that ""Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution"" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem. ""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a mother of two . She walks verdant streets & love listening to her surrounding. But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on. President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.     ","I am against technology being able to read students emotional expressions. We shouldn´t have computers telling exacly how our students are feeling. Some things are personal and some kids might not want other kids to know if there feeling sad, mad, or happy. In paragraph one it tells the percentages on Mona Lisa, that going way to far with personal space and thought. Some things are meant to be un said and if a teacher asks you in class how you felt about that certain situation they can tell if your lying or not, and that´s your choice if you want to express that. Students could be bullied if other kids didn´t like there opinion about something. Even if something made a kid feel happy that something bad happened to another student like personal thoughts , that could be blown out of context. Even though you may not have the brightest look on your face doesn´t mean your not happy, like thousand of kids walk around school with bleh looks and they may actually be happy but just showing that expression, but the computer would read it as sad or mad. Computers are already taking over a lot of things, but when it comes to humans we should´t need a computer to tell us how were feeling. Computers and technology aren´t 100% right, only you would know exactly how your feeling. In conclusion computers shouldn´t be allowed to read students expression. In paragraph 5 Dr. Huang says it isn´t hard to tell whether a friend is feeling happy or sad you should be able to read that, so why exactly do we need a computer doing that? Some things us humans should be able to figure out because its our body and we know how it works. Therefore we shouldn´t need technology going pass our personal boundaries and telling us how we feel . It would just cause more conflict and more wasted money on things we ca just figure out ourselves.","The Seagoing Cowboys is a program, and its main goal is to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. This might not sound fun or interesting. These trips might be half-year long trips, but the trips are life-changing experiences. I'll show you reasons why to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. These reasons are coming from a person who has joined the Seagoing Cowboys and served for three years. The first reason is because of the experience you'll gain from the trips. The trips are life-changing. You have the benefits of traveling the world. You get to see and do a lot of things an average person wouldn't do. You get to see Europe, China, and Greece, and many other beautiful places. You might even take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy or pass the Panama Canal. The experience is an amazing one. These trips can cheer you up. Like I said before, you get to travel to amazing places and do amazing things. These might sound like fun things to do, because they are. You might ask how you have fun while on the ship in the sea. You can play table-tennis, fencing, boxing, baseball, volleyball, or any other games that helped pass time. You have a lot of fun during the trips. At the same time, you're helping peope and other countries and serving as military service. Last but not least, you are more aware of the world. The trips open the world up to you. You're more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This awareness can change your life. All in all, the Seagoing Cowboys is a great program to join. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. On these trips, you're gaining experience. You're visiting a lot of places and having a lot of fun. Your awareness of the world changes during these trips. In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys is a life-changing experience and an amazing opportunity.",,,,,,,

I feel like if I was to take this position I wouldn't be able to forces because I get too distracted at home but if I was in school I would be more focused but for other its is different because they might think the opposite , maybe they can focus more at home and they might think coming to school is a distraction for them. I also believe that if the students dont understand what the program is showing them then there are always other resources like the video conferencing as provided . You dont nesserly have to see each other face to face and you could always ask others for help when needed in both situations. ","NASA has recently been discussing what is believed to be a face on mars. Some people think that this is some kind of alien marking. The essay says, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""(paragraph 2) This may convince certain people to believe that there was once life on Mars. While it may be true, the essay does not say anything about anyone actually getting on Mars to see if it was really just a rock. Maybe there were bones from a human body attatched to the head. Also in the essay it states, ""although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.""(paragraph 6) As a result, the essay also said ' ""we felt this was important to taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.""(paragraph 6) So this statement could be implying that they could be making stuff up just for money. If they put that in the newspaper everyone would want to buy it, which would result in making a lot of money. In addition, the essay says, ""only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""(paragraph 2) this evidence from the article supports my claim and says shadows made it look like something. It could also have been the way something was reflecting off of it. In conclusion, I believe that this thing was just a natural landform. Many of us have seen weird shaped rocks sometimes we just dont pay attention. Also just like the sun forms shadows, that could have been what happened on Mars to make people believe they were seeing a human face.         ","Dear Principle: Many athletic students are not very smart. requiring a ""B"" average to play sports is not fair to us students. It is not fair because many of us have ""C"" averages and sports are supposed to be for people that are passing. You have to consider the passing athletic students eligible. You would basically be taking away their lives. You have to take factors like this into consideration before making rules like that. With this said you need to be more considerate of the people. America is a country for the people. We were created to get away from such rules not to rebuild the rules on another continent. Also ,No offense to the smart kids, but they would really mess up our sports program. If you like this school, You'll not make that rule Please hear me out in this letter. I do hope this has changed your mind about the ""B"" average to play sports rule. If not then you will most likely be ruining hundreds of sporty kids lives. You will make their parents mad at either them or you. So once again I say hear me out. If you don't, it could be the worst decision you've ever made in your career as a principle. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","In society techolgy is almost every thing to people. People around the world hundred, thousands worth of technology, lots of people spend more money on technology than they clothes. So to me I think having technology makes people happy. Having technology to see if it makes them happy is kinda of point less to me. There is nothing the Facial Action Coding could do for people in the world if you ask me. Putting up Ads that is based off your emotion is not a smart idea to me. So if im angry im most likely will have a negative vibe and if you put something up that is close to be negative its not going to make me happy. If I am in a good mood more than likely I would not want to see no Ad. Then there expression is compared against a neutral face, some people just look naturally mad. If some one regular face looks mad then how would it read ther face then, that person could be happy. I think the Facial Action Coding System is a waste of time.","Exploring New Places ""Studying the planets is a amazing thing,"" said my science teacher. When studying the planets there is a lot of information to take in. The atomposhere on Earth is very different from the atmosphere in space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Scientists should study Venus because it has similarites to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there. Venus is known as Earth's twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states in paragraph 4 ""Today, Venus still ahs some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This proves that Venus has some identical features to those that Earth has. It also states in paragraph 4 ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This also proves that Venus has some similar characteristics like Earth. This is how the Earth is similar to Venus and why scientist should continue to study the planet, consdering its dangers. The idea of sending humans to Venus is a topic up for debate by many scientists. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains how NASA has the idea of sending humans to Venus. It states in paragraph 5 ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This shows how scientists have come up with a way to send humans to Venus, even though no human has set foot on another planet. The author also states in paragraph 5 ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not excceed Earth levels."" This also shows how the radiation of Venus is not much different than Earth's and it would not exceed higher on Venus, so a human would be safe from radiation on Venus. Sending humans to Venus is another reason why the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursiut even though it has many dangers. With many great exeptions of studying Venus and sending humans there, the author also shows the dangers of Venus. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states in paragraph 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This proves that is dangerous to travel to Venus with high tempertures that would burn a human alive. The author also states in paragraph 3 ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" This also proves that Venus has expentionally high temperatures that no human can face. These are the dangers that the author takes into consideration when sending humans to Venus. In conclusion, the author from ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After evaluating the article, the author supports the idea of studing Venus. Scinetists should study Venus because it has similarities to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there.    ","I think it is a good idea for all of the 8th graders to take a community service for once in a while. it can help us to do better in life, no just for us but for other people. we can pick out of all different kinds of community services. we can try littering its a helpful decision not just for use but for others. It can prevent others from getting all kinds of sickness, and all so it can be a better place for every human on earth. We can prove to other people that community service doesn't take a lot of time. They can try something short of time but they can still help out some way. There is a lot of other kinds of community services that don't take a lot of time but still they can be fun. One of them can be planting trees, flowers, anything you would like to plant and it can take about 10 to 20 minutes and you still can have lots fun doing it. Once you start you'll be liking it and be wanting to join other activities. Its fun you can just find something you like and you'll enjoy doing it. You can try asking them to see what they like to do or what they do best , once you know what they like to do you can find different community services they can enjoy and at the same time having fun doing it. If people think they don't have time or that it takes a lot of there time, you can try showing them short but fun activities that they can enjoy. Instead of them being stuck at home watching TV the can try and go do some other activities that they know they will like and enjoy doing them. If there good doing sports, they can teach young ones how to play. these can be some of the community services that they can try out and see if they like them cooking , planting, like animals, help old people ,like to cure animals that have been hurt, helping old people getting there groceries, there is a variety of stuff they can try and then see if they like it. if they like any one these or different one they can try doing it once in a while and they can get use to doing it and they can have fun doing them. And it can help us do a better life for little ones when they get big they wont have the variety of sickness that we have. It can be a better world for us and for all. we can try cleaning up litter it can prevent all this damage we are doing to are world and buy helping with no littering it can be the best for us and for all. we can try spreading the word with others not just about not littering but about communty services they can have fun doing it and they can enjoy it.","The topic of driverless cars will be argued until there arent any humans left. But to simply have a driverless car woud be like having an irresponsible parent. Cars were formally made for us to have an easier way of transportation; and now we want cars tha can dive themselves. Taking the taxi away from taxi drivers would put them out of business; As well as Uber Drivers and other assistants. How would the generations after us know what to do in an emergency if the driverless car werent able to function on its own? What would happen to the data base of a company if its system crashed, how would signals get out from the cars routers? Having driverless cars would be a bad idea, for one it would take the place of a taxi driver which would take away jobs. Googles cofounder Sergey Brin says ""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility that a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" Another reason I wouldnt condone in the submitting of driverless cars would be to save the generation after me. Letting fresh young adults use driverless cars wouldnt teach them how to drive. Which means they wouldnt know what to do in case of an emergency. Yes there would be a manual that you'd have to read. But when it comes to fixing technology and mechanics, humans need a hands on experience which would help them in case they dont know what to do if the car becomes driverless. Finally, what would happen in a storm if the connection didnt go through or the companys system crashed? Would that mean the car isnt driverless? ""...For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive rardr sensors, a GPS receiver,a nd an inertial motion sensor."" With all of this technology needed to properly produce a smart/ driverless car, would it be necessary? having this much technology, there would be too many technical difficulties. Which would lead into the owners of the car paying for more that what was even expected. The world of technology today has help us for the better or worse. With smartphones being able to locate people, cars, and places around the world. ToSending a typed papre to your teacher just in time before grades come in. Technology has been tremendously heplful. but to have a 18 year old behind thw wheel of a driverless car not knowing what what to do in case of an emergency or the car having a mal-function would be pointless to buying your first car.

470,825,"Do you believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Learning from online classes can be more beneficial to students than going to class and learning. If schools start offering online classes to their students they will be less likely to spread around a virus or any diseases. Online classes can also be useful if a student is out of town or traveling somewhere. While some people believe classes in person are more interactive with each other in reality online classes can help students in many more different ways. Students should be able to communicate with their teacher in person if they need help with anything. Video calling doesn't help the students the same way talking to the teachers in person can. If a student need help on a math problem looking at the problem in front of you can help you understand it better then looking at it from a computer screen. Even though teachers can help gift you a good education from inside the classroom, you can receive even better education from the teacher helping you online and from some trustful websites. Students when they stay home and take online classes are less likely to get a virus or get sick and miss class. Even if a student does get a virus they can still get online and work on their class work. Students can spread around the virus in class because they didn't want to miss the class work. Just like how right now their is the corona virus spreading all over New York because students thought they had a small flu but in reality they had a really bad virus. Students could stay more healthy and not get a virus if they take classes from home. Some students travel during the school year and they may miss some very important lessons or information. Students can receive some much need information if they have online classes and the teacher keeps updating them. If a student is gone for a week and misses class they would have to catch up and work even harder but if the student has online classes they can just work on it while on vacation. When a student misses class because they are on vacation the teacher doesn't reteach the lesson to just that one student but if it's online the student can just watch the video and learn the important information. Vacations can really miss up a students grades but if the class is online the student can still learn while on vacation. Even though some people think classes in person are more interactive with each other in reality online classes can help students in so many different ways. Students are less likely to get a virus if they take online classes. Students also can keep up their grades up while on vacation because they can work on it if they have internet where they are going. All schools should start offering distance learning for the students so they can learn anywhere and if even if they are sick.","The face. People think it was created by aliens, some others belive it's just a natural landform, but it is in fact a natural landform. Although it does look like a face, that aliens created, it is a landform created by a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, with shadows that make it look like it has facial features. A Martian mesa. That's all the face is. It was created by a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa, with shadows that give it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Martian mesas, are common enough around Cydonia, which is another reason why this could'nt have been created by aliens. Lastly, this couldn't have been aliens, because there is not enough scientific proof to even know if there is even any form of life on mars. The face is just a huge rock formation, with shadows that give you the illusion of facial features. Even though most people believe that it is a natural landform, some do believe it was aliens who created it. One reason is because, it is more benitfital for Nasa to keep quiet, and say it is a natural landform. Another reason is because, the face looks more like an alien face than a natural landform. Although there is more proof that it is a natural landform, that face could have been made by aliens. All in all the face appears to be a natural landform. Some people may disagree but, there is more facts and research, that the face is a natural landform. Although there is more facts about it being a natural lansdform, some people still will think it could have been aliens who created the face. But the face is just a huge rock formation created by a Martian mesa, with shadows that give you the illusion of facial features.          ","Dear Principal, As you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average. But there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life. If these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.

How people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions. In the smile of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Felt the experince of ""The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". People are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions because in a new technology can describe the human motions. They know that the painting of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted they calculate the facial expressions for each emotion universal. The motions of any students in a clasroom computer are confused or bored. In the painting many know the feeling motions of her smile but have 83 percent happy in her smile. In the painting of Mona Lisa is 6 percent fearfun and 2 percent angry. This is painting to recorgnize for many people in all the world, because is an painting of Leonardo da Vinci's. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games to learn more about the motions of people. An example of the text is ""Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vanci Code"". The theory of motion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The Mona Lisa demostration expression is really intended to bring a smile to your face. The new motion-recognition sofware tracks these facial basic motions are happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. The facial emotions for universal to many students want to investige the painting of Mona Lisa. Many use the same techonology for conclude the different motions of the painting. The students can talk about the experince of the Mona Lisa demostration of her emotions about a painting very good. In conclusion the author describes a new technology called ""The Facial Action Coding System"". Because the technology help to know the emotional expressions to students. The painting of Mona Lisa is very famous in the world however many students can use the new technology to learn more about the human motion.             ","The authour feels venus could be alot like earth wich means extra resources that could expand our life. "" Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" There are also things being done to help be safe while gaining information on venus. "" Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" All of this has shown that there are still chances to get to venus, there are reasons to want to go there, and there are things you can do for saftey there. So i agree that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.","Dear principal, I believe that all students should be required to do community service considering that it helps your community and your chances of getting into college. Community service could be as simple and fast as helping clean trash and it helps you because when you try to get into college they like to see community service on your application. When you do community service you help your environment and the people around you because you are taking the first step to helping your city. I also think community service should be required because most students are lazy and like to sit around all day. But if community service was required it would also get kids moving and exercising and that would also be helping the overweight problem. The least us kids could do is give back to the community and that's why i believe community service should be required. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Can you imagine living in a time zone where no one buys cars because they are no longer needed ? The world depend on nothing but technolgy. How would you spend your time? Although there are positive apsects to having a car that drives itself there are also negative aspects to this car. The cars can drive themselves but are unable to drive through traffic jams or raod work . Therefore I am against cars that drive themselves. Even though the cars are smart enough to drive themselves they are not smart enough to drive on non-smart roads. In the late 1950s GM ,General Motors created a car that could run on a speacial track but the track was enbedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to the car. Therefore all roads would have to require upgrades and this is something that is too expensive. The passage says that the cars can't drive through traffic jams,road contruction and when the vehicle is around danger . So if the driver is not paying attention to the car , the road and others around it then how can the car ,the car would be unable to save itself from crashing. With this being said I believe driverless cars are dangerous and would be way to expensive. As i said there are benefits to this driverless car , while the car drives it self it provides enteratinment such as sound but when it is time for the driver to take over it turns everything off. This is a great idea because it creates less distraction for the driver. Imagine driving a driverless car and it shuts down in the middle of traffic ,there is a person driving behind does not notice you are having car troubles and hits you. Whose fault is this accident ? Whose going to pay for the damage? I feel that there are more downfalls with this idea than great ideas .It is dangerous , too expensive , and takes as much energy and time as driving yourself around. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen .         ",,,,,,,
470,901,"Students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home or online. Most people who take online school have jobs and families they need to worry about so that why online is so successful for adults over the age of thirty. Most online school caters to adults who are have jobs but still want to get their education in timely but inexpensive manner. Though the concept of school is a hands on experience meant for learning, practicing social skills, that focuses on core values and ethics that every kid should endorse. School has been a concept forever intertwined with the modern day man. Controversy about schooling is constantly making headlines in the public eye, whether it be about a head masters lying or schools giving out one thousand dollar scholarships. Public schools help us reflect on what we have achieved over the hundreds and thousands of years, whether that be basic math, science, writing, or history. Some people could argue that they understand a class enough not to attend, but it costs more to do online than it does to do public. Though not all countries have a free educational system that tries to be supportive of the lower class not being able to pay. Normally payment is at the beginning of every year and is fairly cheap compared to what it could be in other countries. It can be argued that with the growing teenage population, more disrespect is shown in school, thus making students not want to attend certain classes. School has given every chance they have to show us that there will be people in the real world who won't care about your ability to get your work done if they are distraction to you. Being introduced to other people at a young age prepares us that we can't just think for ourselves anymore and always remember that people can be affected by what you do. When taking online classes the ability to communicate with others about how you got an answer isn't there just because you didn't want to be in a loud class. In math you can use different equations to get the same answer but some are easier than others, but without the other students their it complicates thing by making you learn one way and no other. Core values have been an important issue that kids ,especially teenagers, are forgetting. we pick up core values and ethics from the people around us and what we emerce our selfs into to on the TV. If someone doesnt hang around a lot of people then they won't be as sympathetic or understand how to act when a situation happens. The benefit a student would get from online school wouldn't really be a benefit but would be a crutch. A child shouldn't have a reason to stay home all day and take the classes at home. Social skills that are required for day to day life would end up being forgotten, learning wouldn't be as unique as it is in a real classroom, and a set of morals would only be tailored for that individual instead to thinking about how others would feel.","You say that the Face on Mars was created by an alien civilization. However, this is somply not true. The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to a mesa here on Earth. You may think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but there is substantial evidence to prove otherwise, that the ""Face"" is nothing more than a natural landform. There is plenty of evidence to support the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation. If the Face were created by an alien civilization, NASA would greatly benefit. Therefore, there would be no reason to hide the information. ""defenders of the NASA budjet wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (5). The second photo of the Face on Mars was claimed by some to be inconclusive because of the haze created by the winter weather on Mars. However, a third photo of the Face was taken on April 8, 2001 ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia [the region of Mars where the Face resides]"" (10) tat also clearly shows that the Face on Mars is not a face at all, but simply a natural land formation. The Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural land formation. ""'[the Face on Mars] reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,'"" (12). If the ruins of an alien civilization actually existed on Mars, NASA would reap a great benifit, meaning that there would be no reason to hide the discovery. The first picture showing the Face on Mars as merely a natural landform was dismissed by skeptics because the time of year the photo was taken gave the camera a layer of haze to look through to see the face. This haze, skeptics said, hid the alien markings from view. However, this was disproven in April 2001, when a new photo was taken during the clear summertime on Mars. This photo still showed that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to the mesas of Earth.","To : TEACHER_NAME Every day students like to play Basket ball ,soccer ,base ball, an so on .I attend middle school an young teens enjoy to participate in sports.

This is so because this kind of technology could help determine how much, if any at all, help a student would need in dealing with their emotions. It would also help figure out what triggers certain reactions in certain students. The first reason that this tech would work for students in a classroom is that it could help find out when a student is having a bad day and determine whether or not that student requires some form of psychiatric help. This kind of technology could help with depression, anxiety, and it could even stop the next school shooter, in an extreme case, yes, but possible nonethless. The second reason this technology could be very useful is it could help the teachers understand what actions or words trigger what reactions in students. This is useful because it could be used to take a survey, collecting data and deciding what gives a bad reaction the most and least out of all the people being surveyed. This could be used to decide the curriculum, activities, etc. Now, I understand that there are a decent amount of cons alongside the positive side of this technology, but I believe that the pros far outweigh the negatives in this scenario. When it comes to mental health, and, in the most extreme cases, lives at stake, technology like this is always a step in the right direction.","Venus, an extraordinary planet because of many reasons and fascinating things that goes further than our temporal limits, a very attractive planet that put our imagination to work due to our curiosity and the difficulties that Venus presents when it get time to explore. The planet called by the people as ""The twin of the Earth"" had being proving why is it so interesting enough to go and know more about it. We will see with the author´s text how Venus is a worthy planet to visit even with the kind of dangers that are possible to happen in Venus. First of all Venus is a very hard place to review and investigate deeply. In the text we can see that Venus is in a first look inhospitable, 97 percent of its atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds are highly corrosive, the planet´s surface temperature average is 800 Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than Earth´s pressure. That is something that used to be different in the past where Venus looked like Earth´s enviroment. There used to be mountains, valleys, oceans etc. But all these impediments gets underpreciated when our curiosity grows each day, and in the text we can find the first steps of something that once used to be impossible to think and that´s a correct expedition to Venus. The NASA is looking for a way to send humans to study Venus. This way is to float above Venus. Conditions there are more survivable for humans. The pressure is a lot less, and radiaton levels is not greater than Earth´s radiation, the temperature is considerably lower than the surface temperature. Some scientific advantages have to be completed to at least have a safe investigation expedition such as in photography or video cameras because of low light levels in Venus. Samples of materials can´t be taken either from a far distance and Venus difficult enviroment. The author is convinced that some day the human will be able to do a research in Venus and its convincement is reflected on how he wrote the 6th paragraph where the author says, ""Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to las long enought to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" is giving a small amount of hope to keep track in the research of new technologies to have the key to travel Venus and explore it.","Dear Principal of our school, I should inform you that performing community service is a very wonderful thing to do for our community. A good example is picking up litter that careless people throw on the ground. Another good example is helping the elderly or helping your next door neighbor shovel the snow. These are really good things that the youth can do for older citizens. My response o you is mainly about encouraging you to make students perform community service for others whether they like it or not. First of all, performing community service doesn't really take a lot of time out of your hand. It probably only takes about an hour or so to make a huge difference for others. I used to help at my public library such as ordering the books or placing things in the right order. It wasn't really a big deal at all. It took some time out of my week. I did service there for about an hour a day. Community service isn't really a huge waste of time. Furthermore, community isn't only about helping others. It is also a learning experience. While kids are wasting their time hanging out, playing video games, or watching television, they can do this to learn responsibility. Many parents have kids that are irresponsible. This will help them. This can really help them when they get older. When they become adults they will realize that there isn't time to fool around. Thirdly, this experience will finally let kids get the chance to help adults. The youth usually fools around while they don't realize that they can make a big impact towards other peoples lives. Helping the elderly will make them very thankful for showing that you care and that they can't really do many things without assistance, such as mowing the lawn. In conclusion, community service will finally give the chance for young people to help the environment and the people that live in it. This is very helpful, since many people don't take the time out of their lives to at least make a difference. Hopefully, this will convince you for the students of our great public school to do community service.","The future is full of new and exciting technologies, including the ""driverless car"". The idea of a car that can drive itself is exciting, but also very dangerous. Although there are precautions the companys have taken to prevent accidents, something could always happen, and no company has found the answer to who is at fault if there is an accident. Driverless cars may seem like an exciting new way to travel, but there is not a way for the driver to completely relax. The driverless cars cannot drive where there is not a smooth course. If there is construction work or an accident the car can not drive, and requires the skills of a human, which makes the name ""driverless car"" falsely stated. The way the cars alert the driver that their assitance is needed, is just by annoucing that the driver needs to take over. This way of getting the driver's attention may not always end in success if the driver is distracted and not paying attention to the car or the road. Why not have a human drive instead? The driver has to always be alert and ready to take over in a driverless car, so why not just drive normally? It does not make sense for a driver to sit in a car and wait until they have to take over and drive, and that drive may only take five minutes. It is pointless to have a computer drive and to have the person in the driver's seat be alert. Driverless cars are also making it ""fun"" to drive in a car where a person is not needed nighty percent of the time. Some manufacturers are planning to bring in car entertainment systems, which is another distraction to drivers on the road. Also, not needing to drive gives people more opportunites to be on their cellphones, read road signs, or look at the scenary instead of the road. All of these distractions are giving drivers more reasons to not pay attention to the road, and will prevent them from taking over the car when the computer can no longer drive. Driverless cars are dangerous, but they do bring some goods to the table. Driverless cars are estimated to only use half of the fuel that regular cars use today, which can help the environment immensely. They are a new and exciting way to travel and get around, and if all the drivers are paying attention, can prevent accidents because of the sensors and cameras. Driverless cars are exciting, but they are dangerous and have never been tested in real situations, like a family going on vaction, or someone going to work. The outcomes are unknown, something can always go wrong, and no manufacturers know who will be blamed when something does go wrong. The cons outweigh the pros, driverless cars are dangerous and cannot be trusted to handle situations if a driver is not paying attention. Driverless cars should not be developed and sold. ",,,,,,,
311,104,"""It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice. For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral collge. In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just becuase they can even though us other people do count. The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!"" (Plumer, Source 2) and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. "".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer, Source 2) every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000. Lastly, the electoral college is irrational like seriously what idiotic person came up with this. I will say this again, but a monkey could of made a better system than this. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes"" (Plumer, Source 2) I know this statement says it all becuase how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this. I know that electoral college vote can help and not cause problems, but there are more problems while there is one easy fix which is popular vote. ""It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer, Source 2).                                                                                            ","I am a student who attends SCHOOL_NAME. In this article I am going to explain to you about why our principal should consider the policy that allows students in our school to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as phones are turned off during class time. I think that we should be able to have phones in school for our free time. We barely get enough time in school for anything as it is. We get up in the morning, go to school, and attend class periods all day for 8 hours strait and then end up going home with homework in your hands. Then we get up the next morning and do as we did the day before all over again. How much does a school expect one student to handle. i don't think the principal should even have a right to allow the policy that does not allow students to use cell phones in school at all. I know that education is very important and that students should do as well as we can and get good grades. But having the right to use a cell phone during lunch period or any other free time would not affect that at all. The principal should definitely consider the policy that allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and any other free time, as long as they are turned off during class.","Driverless cars are coming thats no good! Since 2009 google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless. The Google cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. In my opion driverless cars are pretty dangerous and stupid. I think that becasue drivers would try to play on their phone more and do other things that will not make them keep their eyes on the road or their surroundings. Just because the cars are ""driverless"" doesn't mean they cant mess up or have a glitch when they are driving and when they are playing on their phones. Having driverless cars is a huge mistakes they will put peoples life at risk and so many people when end up wrecking and dieing because they are more worried about their mobile devices. My second reason I think ""driverless"" cars are stupid is becasue people will not pay attention to their surrounding. People will pay attention to the things that are inside the car and not the things outside the car like other cars around them or even other object around them. People driving the car will be more focoused on the radio or all the cool features that come with the car like the new bluetooth radio or the new settting on the radio. The new cars will have so many new featrues that people will not even realize they are on the road. My last reason I think the cars are stupid is becasue what are people gonna do when the car breaks or glitches up. The first batch of cars will have issues just like the first batch of everything that is new. The car could glitch up at any moment when the car is in motion and some one is in it. What are people gonna do when they are driving and the car just stops driving itself and runs off the road into oncoming traffic or runs off a mountain. What are the people gonna do when their family memebrs die because of the cars glitching up and killing their brother,sister, or cousin. The first thing they are going to do is blame the company and sue them for everything they have. That is why I think ""driverless"" cars are stupid and dangerous. People will not pay attention they will car more about their phone. People will not pay attention to their surrounding they will pay attention to things inside the car. And the cars have a high chance of glitching up and killing the driver or maybe another person in the street or on the sidewalk. That is why I think they are very dumb and dangerous.","Dear principal, I am writing to argue against requiring at least a B average. I believe changing the requirements to play sports or any other extra curricular activities is outrageous. If students have a C average, which is a passing grade, they should be able to participate. Many students at our school have a grade C average, if you take away sports it could possibly drive them away from even coming to school. Now what good would that do? Raise and teach the world's children to throw away our education's and start working dead end jobs. Well I know I don't want to, so this is me arguing for us, the children's sake. I know how tough this decision must be, but that is because you're making it challenging. Sports and other activities is what our country run's on. That is what gives us fuel, makes us want to learn more and better ourselves. The purpose in life is to make the best of it, to do what we love. That is what us children are trying to do. Make a better world for the children to come. So consider thinking about what your decision can do to us and all of the people to come. If your decision has the power to do all of that, then imagine the power you'll be putting into us by allowing us to do what we love even if we have a grade C average(it is a passing grade). At least we're trying and that let's you know we all care. sincerily your student, STUDENT_NAME","As students are furthering their education, teachers are assigning summer assignments in order to prepare them for their upcoming class. Many believe these summer assignments should be student designed due to students' convenience, nevertheless, these summer assignments should be teacher designed because it ensures that students are prepared for the class, exposes them to new material outside of their comfort zone, and keeps students' busy throughout the break. Before the school year ends, teachers take time out of their work day to produce a summer assignment for their students' next school year. Having teacher designed summer assignments help ensure that students are ready for the content in their upcoming year. Students are unable to know their struggles with next years content until they are actually in that class. Teachers are able to look at their lower scoring topics of the year and put a couple questions of that topic onto the summer assignment. By doing this, it will help the students learn from the past students' struggle topics. Because of the summer assignment, students are able to get a boost and learn quicker when they are being taught in class. An example of this happened during a student's sophomore year while picking their junior year classes. This particular student had to choose between academic biology or honors biology; they were unsure of which class they wanted to take. The student eventually choose honors biology in the end; she found out that about the summer assignment due the first week of classes. She struggled with converting units and was nervous the topic would be a struggle in the class. Her teacher assured her that it was normal to struggle as many other students struggled with that as well. She complained on and on until she came into class that next year and excelled due to the summer assignment she completed. If the student had designed her own summer assignment, she would not have excelled as well as she did because of the teacher designed summer assignment. As teachers are designing their own summer assignment for their class, they put new material that the students have never been exposed to. While many express how having student designed summer assignments give students more freedom; they don't realize how most students will not go outside of their comfort zone to learn new material. If the students were to design their own summer assignment, all of the material will be information that they already knew or are most comfortable with. Teacher designed summer assignments will give a chance for the student to push themselves out of their comfort zone to learn new information that will ultimately help them with their next school year. For example, the summer before junior year, an AP Language and Composition teacher gave students an assignment that included reading or watching 15 sources. These 15 sources had to be stretched out from 5 different categories: current events, history, politics, entertainment, and documentaries. The students were forced out of their comfort zone by their teacher having their students exposed to all of the different categories. Because of the exposure, the students are aware of information they would not have known if they didn't complete the assignment. When given the chance, students will stay in their own comfort zone; which the teachers can break when there are teacher designed summer assignments. When the teachers are trying to break students' comfort zones with the summer assignments, it gives the students a chance to think outside of the box and spend more time trying to interpret the new information. For most students, summer break is filled with eating and watching TV on their couch; if the students were given the chance to design their own assignment for the break, they would put easy information for them to complete in order for them to have more time to spend on the couch eating chips. The students would come back with their minds still tangled up with the TV and couch; if teachers were to design the assignment, the teachers would put information that they know would keep the students' minds busy and working throughout the summer. This makes it easier for students to ease back into school; rather than them still being in summer mode 3 months into the school year. Being eased back into the school year is a thing many students struggle with. It can be fixed by having teacher designed summer assignments. It is time for all teachers to regulate teacher designed summer assignments in order to make the school year easier for all students. While many students will complain about the workload, it will pay off later when they realize the summer assignment helped them with the content of the class. They will also be interested in new topics because of the teachers input in the summer assignment to push them outside of their comfort zone. Overall, summer assignments have been proven to assist students all around when they are teacher designed. ","According to the article the Facial Action Code System i think is valuable to student in classroom's. I am for it because aacording to the text its tells you how great it can predict how your feeling. The article gives us a little information on how accurate it works numbers showing she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry it shows that the Facial Action Code System is an new way to figure out people's emotions. Also it says the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Also this new software can show a lot about your emotions for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Also i think its a good idea for students in classroom because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and your teacher could help you or could try to do something more to keep you from getting bored. I think from the articlke this would be a great thing to get and to start using because according to the text its a great tool to use in the future. ","In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his claim by stating that the reasoning for continuing research on how to get to Venus's surface is, because it was once very similar to earth's surface long ago. Astronomers claim that Venus probably had oceans and supported many different life forms just like Earth. The author states that the value of returning to Venus seems idisputable due to the fact that it is sometimes our nearest option. Since it is our nearest option and giving consideration to how long time frames of space travel are, this is a pretty good claim. So far the author's claims are, that it is our nearest option and it was once very much like Earth and habitable. The only problem now is Venus's surface conditons. On Venus's surface the temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. However the author goes on to state that NASA has a possible solution to the conditions on Venus's surface. NASA's possible soolution would be to have a blimp like vehicle hover 30 miles above Venus's surface. Even though the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit it is still survivable for humans. However researchers cannot take samples of Venus's surface by hovering in a ship safely above the planet. The author states that instead of looking at the problems as risks we should look at them as challenges. The author claims that striviing to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us to many more equally intimidating endeavors. Also that our travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So the authors claims for furthering research on how to get to Venus are, it's the nearest planet to us, it used to be very hospitable and much like Earth, and that we should see the risks as challenges and find ways to get past them. The author supported these claims very well.",,,,,,,
311,825,"Dear state senator, I believe that we shouldn't keep the electoral college process because it should be in favor of the popular vote for the president of the Unites States instead of how it is now. I believe this becasue for example with this system voters don't vote for the president but for the slate of electors even though this system does come with some positives like it allows them to focus on their campaign efforts but can turn into a complete disaster factor. To begin with,the system of the electoral college does not allow the voters to vote for the president but only for a slate of electors, they are the ones who elect the president. There is always an off-chance that those electors that won the statewide election would go to Congress and the opponent recieves more electoral votes. The electors are chosen from the state they could be state conventions, or the state party's central committee and even sometimes the presidential candidate themselves. This system then leads to several cons such as the voters can not control whom their electors vote for and also the voters tend to get confused sometimes about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Although, maybe we should be able to keep our despised method of choosing the president because, it comes with several pro's like for example, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible like in 2012's election when Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the votes that came from Romney. In this election the winner is aware with the electoral votes which induces the candidates and allows them to focuses on their campaign efforts. Lead them to the toss-up states which basically mean they are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign so the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Last but not least, this system is also known a the disaster factor like for example the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century because they had to consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and that they will always define the will of those people. Many of the electors have occasionally refused to vote for their own party candidate and even cast a deciding vote for whomever it is that they want or perfer to please. this method should not be prohibeded any more because of the causes it is doing which is affec In conclusion it is official the the system of the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and also it is concluded to be an irrational system. I still believe that the electoral college should be elected by popular vote for the president.    ",I agree that students should take their cell phones to school and be able to use them during lunch periods and other free times. The cell phones will have to be off during class but in our free times we could use them. I think they should let us because i think its a great way to refresh your mind a little and then go back to work. I would say also that bringing a cell phone to school is okay because we wont be using them during class only on free times. It would be better if they would let us bring cell phones to school because when a student is bored they can always refresh their mind by using their cell phones on their lunch period or their free times. That way if we bring cell phones and they don't let us students might be using their cell phones during class and their not going to be paying attention to the teacher. And if we knew that we could bring cell phones we wouldn't be using our cell phones behind the desk so that the teacher doesn't catch us. If we do that because we know we cant bring any cell phones to school we are going to be on our cell phone and we are not going to be paying attention to the teacher about what she's teaching us. If we knew that we could bring cell phones we would just wait for our lunch period to use them or on our free times. That way we could be paying attention to the teacher and not using our cell phones because we know that we could use them on our lunch period or free times. Another reason i think we should be able to bring cell phones to school is that if we bring cell phones to school and we cant bring them we are going to get in trouble for using our cell phones and not paying attention to the teacher. Also if we don't pay attention to the teacher we wont be able to understand the work or the homework she gives us and we wont do it because we don't understand it. If we don't do our work or our homework we are going to get bad grades and our grades are going to go down. That's my other reason why i think we should be able to bring cell phones instead of bringing them when we cant and be using them in school. Most of the students that have cell phones would like to bring them to school and some do so they can be using them when the teacher is not looking at them. Another reason that they should let us bring cell phones to school is so that we wont have to be scared that the teacher might catch us and get in trouble for it. When we know we could bring cell phones to school we could just bring them off and during our lunch period or free time we can turn them on and use them without fearing that the teacher is going to catch you using it when your not supposed to. More reasons are that if you have your cell phone on during class and you forgot to put it on silent if it rings or something the teacher can catch you right away and might take your cell phone then she would tell your parents you have it and they need to go get it. These are my reasons to say that they should let us bring cell phones to,"Driverless cars had always been only a fantasy. However, recent developments in transportation make this fantasy a possibility. Still, people question whether the development of said ""drierless cars"" would be beneficial or detrimental to society. In the article, ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author's report on the growing developments on driverless cars shows a more positive than negative trend for the future of automobiles. Examples from the the article attest to this observation. The creation of a driverless car represents a stepping stone for the evolution of transportation to motorists, futurists, and manufacturers alike. In the third and fourth paragraphs, the author gives readers the history on the development of autonomous cars from customized tracks to ""Google's modified Toyota Prius."" This brief history of the innovation of the automobile shows readers the already impressive progress that researchers had accomplished so far. By comparing present driverless cars such as ""Google's modified Toyota Prius"" to the very first autonomous prototype tracks such as General Motor's special test track, the author enables readers to appreciate how far humanity has gone and how close humanity was to being able to construct autonomous cars. Later in the article, the author informs the reader of BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Although the traffic jam assistant can ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,"" ""this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The BMW Traffic Jam Assistant shows the extent to which automobiles can drive autonomously. Although the car still requires the full attention of a driver, the BMW Traffic Jam Assistant serves as proof of researchers' accomplishments over the development of ""driverless cars. As seen in the various accomplishments that might be able to make driverless cars a reality, the construction of a truly autonomous car would be remembered as a landmark of human achievement, a final stage in the evolution of the autonomous car. Although autonomous cars appeal to the public eye, the introduction of driverless cars bring about some concerns from the law. As ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe,"" it will be imperative that the possible construction of these autonomous vehicles be flawless. People to this day still doubt the reliability of the driverless car as seen how ""it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"" in some states. However, the current automobile technology was centered around the safety of the passenters as seen when the author quotes, ""in this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature."" When explaining the purpose of the google car, the author states, ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" The fairly autonomous Google car was developed for the sake of making roads of the future safe. Based of the trend in the developments of the autonomous car, the cars of the future will not only be more technologically advanced, but the cars will bring about a safer environment for both drivers and pedestrians. The reliability of the autonomous car should not be of concern to skeptics as the cars will continue to evolve to suit the needs of the driver as ""safety is a big concern"" to developers. ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" In the article, ""Driverless cars are Coming,"" the author's reports on the hopeful introduction of the ""driverless car"" presents a positive trend in the future of travel as the fiinal development of the first autonomous vehicle would be both a memorable and benefical achievement. Autonomous cares have been made for the sole purpose of tending to the operator's safety and as research progresses, the safety of drivers across the continent shall improve as well.","There are a lot of obese children in this generation. You cannot take away sports even if their grades are low. It is unfair and we need to exercise. We need P.E. because it is important for a lot of unhealthy children!! We need all the exercise and fun. If we don't exercise then we will continue to be obese and lazy. Not having exercise isn't going to make us do better on our grades! Being healthy helps us focus, eat better, and concentrate more on our grades. Trust me, those who aren't getting exercise won't have better grades. Even if you only give the Grade A and B averages exercise it wouldn't be fair for all the other students that have low grades. It wouldn't be fair whatsoever. This is uncalled for, just ripping away exercise to kids who need it, but have extremely low grades! You should be ashamed of yourself for even considering not letting kids have what they need! Sure lot's of people say you don't NEED exercise, but honestly we all do actually need it. We need to have the running, and strength that our gym teachers provide us. And just forcing it away because of lousy grades, which we can fix easily, is just cruel! Gym helps build muscles. When you take it away because of grades, not only are you letting kids become obese, but you are also taking away what strengthens them. Their legs won't be any good because they will be too weak. They can hurt themselves when they finally get good grades and randomly start exercise. They need to start from the beginning like everyone else to build up strength like everyone else. Don't take away what we need the most. I beg of you, do NOT take away our exercise, strength, and fun! Its cruel and unusual punishment to make a child suffer! We are suffering when we aren't getting exercise! Obesity is striking America everywhere! When you take away sports then you are just helping the obesity problem grow!! Please don't do this! For the sake of us, the kids! Don't take away what we hold dearest! We cannot help it if we aren't good in math or algebra! Instead of taking away things, get special classes for after school, make time for a study hall and send the kids that need a little help to a class for extra learning. But taking away sports is just plain unfair!! Listen to reason and don't go through with this plan.","Summer assignments are known to and disliked by every students that has had to complete these tedious tasks. Schools assign summer projects to assure that their students are still learning during their breaks. However, as you grow up the tasks that are assigned tend to shift from something that is teacher-designed to student-designed. Some people may say that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial to a students learning, because teachers know the material that should be learned and these project are easier to understand. However, they are wrong because student-designed projects have a lot more benefits that are necessary to a students learning and growth. Summer projects should be student-designed because they ensure that the subject of the assignment is relevant and interesting to the student and they teach them important skills. To begin, student-designed projects let students pick subjects that are most likely to benefit them. Teachers dont know what field every student wants to study in, and so they cant make a project that will be beneficial to everyone. For example, the most common summer assignment is to read a book and then write an essay on what the student has learned, which helps kids in their reading and writing skills. However if a student wanted be a scientist, although this project would be somewhat useful, it wouldnt help them get closer to achieving their goals and dreams. On the other hand if the project would have been student-designed the future scientist could have chosen to conduct experiments or learn more about what interests them. Also, student-designed projects motivate kids to continue learning and so they wont lose interest. When a student picks their own assignment, they will be more likely to finish it and more than that they will actually want to finish the project. An example of this in a different context from my daily life is myself doing some cleaning. If my parents told me to clean, i will most likely put it off or do a sloppy job, because i didn't want to do it in the first place and at that point i am being pressured and forced to do the chore, but if i chose to do it on my own terms everything would get done in an orderly fashion. I feel like students use a similar mindset for completing project. If it was student-designed, they would be motivated to keep working and in the end they would produce better work. Some people may say that teacher-designed projects are better because, they focus on material that students should know for every career option, but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field. Secondly, student-designed projects teach students very important life skills. It teaches them to be self-reliant. They have to come up with their own project and set out their own rules and criteria. They cant look back at the instructions and follow what the teacher said, and they cant ask specific question about how to do the project, because everyone has a different project specific to themselves. This type of project makes it necessary to think on their own and not get help or take short cuts from others. Learning how to problem solve and understand things on your own is something that will be crucial as an adult so it best to learn it at a young age. Also, self-projects help you stay organized. When you are doing something completely on your own, with your own ideas you cant lose or forget things because it is detrimental to your project. Unlike something that is assigned where you can just look back on the website or check the paper to find the answers, you have to keep track of everything yourself or else you wont have the answers. Lastly, student-designed projects help with time-management. During my personal project, since i had trips and activities planned during the summer, i had to set out a specific time line with goals that i wanted to have complete by each week. Before this project, I was very bad at completing tasks because i would always put it off until it was the very last minute. With this project, i was forced to do everything in a process or else i would fall behind. Students would not learn all these skills if everything was laid out by a teacher in a teacher-designed project. Although teacher-designed projects are easier to understand and the teacher know what material is important, student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student. Having a student design their own summer project ensures that what they are choosing to learn is beneficial and interesting to them. It also teaches students life skills that are important for everyone to learn at a young age. The point of summer assignments are to keep the student learning even when they are out of school. I think if the main goal of the school was to have students just learn information during the summer, then a teach-designed project would be acceptable. However, if the schools wanted their students to not only learn but grow and develop as young adults, then having student-designed projects are the better options to go with. ","Having this type of technology can help people understand others emotions in many ways. It is obvious that this type of technology can not only help others understand students emotions, but possibly help the students who are feeling a certain way. I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. Having technology that can help show how a person is truly feeling is hepful in so many ways. For example, helping a person out who is feeling sad. A student in the classom is normally good at hiding their true emotions or how they are really feeling, but with this technology, a teacher could possibly help this student out once finding out that the student was upset or bothered with something either inside or outside of the classroom. Another way this technology is valuable is by being able to notice when a student is flustered or angry about not understanding a certain part of what they are learning. Not only can this technology determine one emotion, but can determain mixed emotions. This could help a lot when a student in the classroom may not fully understand a topic they are learning but say they understand it completly. Having the chance to use this technology can help students further understand the subject they are on, because the teacher for sure recognizes that the student may not understand it. This also means teachers have more of the oppertunity to help their students out mentally. The use of this technology in classroms is very valubale for many obvious reasons. ","In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", Venus is explained to be very dangerous, harsh, and challenging. In this article, the author suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. While the author does explain the harsh matters of the situation, he still supports his ideas and reasons on why Venus should be worth exploring. In the article, the author states that, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."". This quote has good meaning and reasoning on why the author feels that Venus should be worth exploring. With this quote, it is noticable that the author believes in taking risks. In this case, the author believes in taking a risk this big and challenging because it is greatly fascinating by astonomers and it will provide a great amount of knowledge that was once never known before. It will provide a sense of accomplishment, not just for NASA, but for everyone who wants to know what is living on places outside of Earth. The author states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditons, but survivable for humans."". With this quote, the author is showing how he does understand the difficulties and dangers of going up and exploring Venus. The author is listing a challenge but still comes back with a reason why Venus should be worth the pursuit. In this quote, specifically, the author thinks the pursuit is worth is because humans will still survive that challenge. It may be harsh, but it can be accomplished. In the article, the author also states, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."". In this quote, the author is stating that if scientists want to know more, explore more, and seek more about Venus, then they are going to have to get very up close to it. The author is stating that yes, it will be dangerous, but it should be thought of as a challenge, not given up on. The author feels that a challenge like this should be accepted. In this article, the author feels that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. The author ends with this statement, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". The author is stating that if Venus can be accomplished, so can a lot more. ",,,,,,,
311,901,"Dear Senator, I wish to ask you a favor of keeping the Electoral College or changeing to election by popular vote for the presdent of the United States. First of all, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president. Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascetainnent. listing all of the presidents who ran for president. after the presidental election is heild every four years on a tusedayafter the first monday in vovember. you help chose your states electors. Furthormore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged . On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh yea and senitor under the eletoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president . Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidental party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirerly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not winthe nactional popular vote. So Mr. senator sir im only asking you this one thing if u coud just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. pleez thats all im asking from you to  do for me just one thing. quite sime thing to do right ..    ","Dear Principal. I support policy 1 students should be able to bring cell phones to school and use them during free time. The reason i support this is there could be an accident at school and school phones aren't working, the student may stay after school and need a ride too get home, and finally the student may have a medical condition that is not on file. these are the reasons I support policy 1. The 1st reason I support policy 1 is there could be an accident at school. There could be an attack at the school and the culprit moves all the teachers away from there phones. Who are they going too depend on? The students who have cell phones too call law enforcement. the student that does have a cell phone could call and stop precious lives from being lost. The second reason I support the 1st policy is the student may need a ride too and from school. picture this, it's late after every one has left the building and went home accept one kid who doesn't have a cell phone. He may have too walk home alone and could possible be endangered by some of the crazy people that we unfortunately have in this world. It could be your kid, it could be a student like me. The third and final reason I support policy 1 is there could be a student with a medical condition that is not on file. imagine there being a student that suddenly began too have a seizure. your afraid and you cant get in contact with the mother and don't know the fathers number you could simple pull the students phone out go into there contacts and call the parents again or call another gradin of the student. You wouldn't want this too happen and probably believe this wont happen but accidents do happen. These are the reasons i support policy 1. please take in consideration what iv just wrote you. also please keep my pre in mind while you read others. sincerely : Concerned student.","Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? Well no I can't really imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore . I can't imagine that because theres always gonna be a time where you need to go somewhere & your gonna need transportation to get you there . If there were no cars in the future so many lives would be so miserable because who would wanna walk everywhere they need to go? I know I would get tired of walking . There's so many places where people need to be on time but only with some kind kind of transpotation . Life wouldn't be so great without cars because just even walking the house or even to go down the street for something important would really get annoying & tired . When reading paragraph 7 it talks about how BMW announced the development of ''Traffic Jam Assistant in 2013. Well just because there were alot of ""Trafic Jams'' in 2013 doesn't mean just think about the future without any cars . We need transpotation everywhere we go. I know that there's many of ways for transportation but walking , I don't think that's really a great idea knowing that we walk 24/7 365 days out of the whole year . Having a car & knowing that you can drive it around anytime you would like to is actually good , because even though the gas that you put in your car goes up a dollar or 2 every week doesn't just give up or think about not having cars in the future. There are teenagers all over the world that are looking foward to getting them a car when they get older & even teens and adults now that are wishing that they could get them a car. My position on driveless cars is that what is a driveless car if you still need a driver to drive the car ? You will always need someone to drive the car even if it is a driveless car. There are car crashes everywhere you go , but you can always fix that problem by sharing the road with the other drives . Watching out for other drivers and the people that are walking is a big step of getting behind the wheel . Making sure that there aren't other people in the way so that you will not hit them & even following the rules of the road , like making sure that you stop at STOP signs & even waiting for your turn to turn while driving. There's no need to imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.   ","Dear Principal, I say students do not need a B average to participate in sports. Many students i know have a C average, sometimes a B average. Every day, students need something to look forward to, help them and help them stay fit. To take away someone's pursuit of happiness is against the constitution. I declare that it is not right to take away sports from C average students! Students need something to look forward to everyday. If I had nothing to look forward to everyday I would be depressed. Many of my friends who are in sports, look forward to after school sports. They look forward to games, practices and seeing their friends everyday. Even if they were to join a school sport and had no friends in that sport, they could make friends. I am not a very social person, so i don't really have anything to look forward to at school, other than friends. Athletes usually like or love the sport they play or else they wouldn't be playing it. Even if a person weren't getting a B average, they would only have a little bit to look forward to. Plus, having a C average motivates them to at least try hard. Never have I ever met someone who didn't like the sport they played. Sports help people. A good alternative to drugs and alcohol is sports. If you were to take away school sports, I bet there would be a incline of drugs and alcohol at school. Making and keeping friends is a great life skill. Raise the average grade up to a B and ou will be taking that away. Sports can also become relaxing. I learned that doing exercise releases a chemical in your brain that makes you feel happy. So having a school sport, say if they were almost at a D average instead of a C, they would play, realize, then work harder at school. B averages are sometimes hard to reach, like if there is fighting at home. C is an overall average for a reason. To relax, athletes focus on sports. Relaxing inspires them to do better in everything. Another thing about sports is they prevent suicide and such. If a students parents were fighting, they might not know what to do. But, if a athletes parents were fighting, he or she could go outside and start playing a sport. One thing over the years in America that has happened is that there is an obesity problem. So if we keep school sports open to those who have a C average, we will also be reducing the obesity level in our schools. Staying fit is very important. If someone really loved a school sport, and you raised the average up to a B, and they had a C, they would be crushed. Not only would they be crushed, they would be stressed. Stress leads to eating, sleeping, and school problems. Then all that junk leads to other things. Obesity is one of those things. I know I get stressed out really easy and sometimes i just want to run around, but at my house there is no place for me to run around. Many students have no place to run around when they don't feel right. Give them that chance! Keep sports grade averages at a C! B averages mean above average for one thing, and a C means average. Being average is ok, it may inspire people to be better. One day, everyone will learn how much they love a certain sport and there will be less stress, something to look forward to everyday, and help with the weight problem in America. Stay at a C average! Thanks for your time. STUDENT_NAME","There are over 1,000 students who are required to complete summer assignments. There are the ones who do complete the summer assignments and the ones who do not complete the summer assignments. Many believe that the summer assignments are to difficult to complete and even question if the summer assignments should really be teacher-designed or changed to make it student-designed. However, others believe that they should keep the summer assignments the way they are and keep it teacher-designed and not make it student-designed or else it would be to easy. With all of this information in mind, the summer assignment should be teacher-designed because they make people think on how a problem should be solved, they make them ready for a challenging situation, and they help people retain lost information. One reason to have the summer assignments teacher-designed, is so people think about how a problem is solved. Teacher-designed summer assignments ask difficult questions to help students not to make student think that they can not do the summer assignment. This helps students by making them think instead of giving them a simple multiple or addition question. It challenges the mind and creates a path of emotions along the way; but when people finish, it is the most satisfying thing in the whole universe. Then afterwards, being able to share the experience with people, makes others want to do it to or do something more complex. Having teachers design problems, that make people think, can change people's life. This is true for one girl, named Generic_Name, who had a teacher give her a summer assignment that for math. As she was doing the summer assignment, she found a question that was difficult and complex to the point where she didn't understand how to do it. However, she decided she would figure it out and complete the summer assignment, in which she did, by using the formula and topics she already knew and by looking some stuff up, she was able to complete the question and get a perfect score on her summer assignment. Having a teacher-designed summer assignment can make people ready for a Challenging situation. By completing the summer assignments, it shows that some students can handle challenging and complex problems and situations. Some of the problems on a summer assignment could be seen in the real world; so by finishing those problems it makes people ready for success in the real world. For example, If a teacher were to give a student a summer assignment dealing with math, and one of the questions on the assignment was complex and difficult but that student was able to figure it out from past knowledge, then when the student is an adult and ends up seeing that question again the student would be able to figure it out and would get the satisfaction of completing it. So even if a problem is challenging on a summer assignment, completing it and getting the right answer will make people successful in the future. In contrast to that, there are people who end up solving the difficult problems and go through the challenges of a summer assignment, but they either never end up using that advantage or just forget it altogether. However, there are people who never forget the problems on a summer assignment because writing it and doing the problem without cheating or giving up helps people remember the problems. Completing the summer assignment also helps people retain information for the following school year. For some students once the school year is over they forget everything they learned and end up having to catch up once they get back in school. But having teacher-designed summer assignments helps students get the information they need to know for the following school year not just random information from several years ago. With teacher-designed summer assignments, students would do fantastic throughout the school year than if they were given student-designed summer assignments. They would be able to accurately use the information they have and think about the problems. They would be able to experience the difficulty of the problems and experience the satisfaction of completing a complex problem. They also would be able to bring back forgotten information that they need for the following school year or for their future. So having a teacher-designed summer assignment rather than a student-designed summer assignment would be better; not just for students, but teachers as well.","Leonardo Da Vinci's renaissance painting ""Mona Lisa"" is one of the famous painting this world has ever known. But there was one question in my mind,""WHAT IS HER EMOTION""? Is she smiling, is she angry, is she sad, what is her emotion. Now this new technology called FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) can measure human emotions. It also measures Mona Lisa's emotion. Is it valuable in today's world. Nowdays, unlimited machines have been built to comfort human civilization. Some of them really benefitted, some of not. Now a Human emotion telling machine is built to measure emotions. I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, ""IT IS USELESS"". WHY?.Let me explain you. Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days. I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make. Useless because it has no role to deal with human stress, it reads emotions, that's pretty cool. But what anout dealing with stress. I hope you like my thought.   ","In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" I do not agree with the author. I do not agree with him because there are so many things about it that make it unable for humans to live on it. For example the average tempature is over 800 degrees, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth, and the atmospheare is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. When further reading this article I noticed that there are a lot of bad things that could happen on Venus, but very few good things. Human bodys would not be able to adapt to the difference between Earth and Venus. My first argument for this article is the tempature reaching over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. When the tempature is that high it would make it hard for humans to live becuase our body's are not used to it. Also it would not be easy to have anything there for good nutrition. You would be unable to plant anything or even have a liquid without it boiling. Even hovering over it by 30 miles it is still around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Also to counter this article is that the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what it is on Earth. For example as stated in the article it would crush a submarine. Imagine what it would do to your body, or even anything you were to own. And finally the atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide which would make it very hard to breath. When caribon dioxide is that high is would be very hard to survive because you would not be able to grow any food, or breath. And also the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Which does not make it any better for humans only worse. When reading the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" I relized that Venus is not a good pursuit because there is no way humans will ever be able to live on it. I know this because the tempature is over 800 degrees, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater then what it is on Earth, and finally 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. Therefore it would not be a worthy pursuit because human are unable to live on it. ",,,,,,,
126,104,"Dear State Senator, I propose that we change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States rather than having the Electoral College. I say this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many ways more than one. I'll start off by saying that Electoral College is unfair to voters. I strongly agree about this because under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors, who then elect the president. This system is unfair because you don't always know who your electors are and you can't always control who the electors vote for. If you can't or don't know who they are voting for, then how can we trust them with the fate of our country? Although us people don't always make the right decisions, at least with popular vote we would all know that our votes wouldn't be put in someone elses hands. To continue my agruement, the Electoral College is also unfair in this way. Say if there was to be a tie in electoral votes, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote for the president and the Senate would chose the vice president. When this would happen you would then not know who they were going to vote for and what your government's fate would be. So again if we had election by popular vote this wouldn't happen. Lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters by the winner-take-all system. Since there is a winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. An example of this is back during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't get to see the candidates at all. Some of the largest media markets didn't even see a single campaign ad. This is completely unfair and ridiculous to all potential voters. In the end, I think that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and ridiculous. With all the valid points and arguments I have made, they make a pretty good reason to abolish the electoral college.    ","People ask for advice from others all the time. Sometimes people go to one person for advice, and at others they go to multiple people for advice. For a couple of different reasons, in order to make the best choice it is better to ask several people for advice rather than just one person. One of the reasons that asking multiple people for advice can lead someone to making the best choice is when he/she hears several different opinions. Hearing these different opinions will allow he/she to choose which opinion is the best for the given situation. Where as if he/she only went to one person for his/her opinion, it may not be the best possible advice for the situation. That is just one way asking multiple people for advice can lead to the best decision. Another reason asking several people for their opinions can lead to the best choice made is when someone is looking for advice on a certain topic. When getting advice on a certain topic people want factual information and advice from someone who knows a lot on the topic. The problem is some people know more than others on certain topics. But the more people asked for advice, the more likely someone who is educated on the topic is to share his/her advice. Later whoever was searching for advice on the topic will be able to decide which one is the most factual and which one to actually follow through on in the scenario. That is the second way asking more people for advice can lead to the best choice made. In the long run it is not smart to only go to one person for his/her opinion. Asking multiple people for their opinions will lead to more factual and correct advises as well as allowing whoever is asking for advice to make the optimal choice possible for the given situation.","There are many reasons to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

So for those reasons i think community service should be required. Community service should be required because kids would have less time to get in trouble. that means there will be less fights. less vandalism, and less money to fix it because community service is a non-profit organization. It also means that there will be less time to try drugs, with less time to try drugs there will be less addicts. Second of all it will help the environment. By helping the environment you are saving trees, and when you save trees you help make paper, oxygen, etc. Also you make the air cleaner. That is the second reason that there should be required community service. It will also give kids something to do. Kids are often bored and sit on their but and gain on wait. Also when they have nothing to do they go and get in trouble. that is my third reason I think that required community service is a good idea because 1) kids have less time to get in trouble 2) it helps the environment 3) it will give kids something to do                  ","I agree with this change. I think that our principle should change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Think about it, if you were a parent would you really want your child paying more attention to his or her sport than focusing on his or her education? i sure would not. If the principle changes the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average the students will try their hardest to get their grades up if they want to get into a sport or other activity. Now if the principle doesn't change this the students would not care for their grades as much, especially if they are an athlete. They would just be waiting for the bell to ring so they can go play more sports. The principle should also change this school policy because if she does this the students will be learning more. Instead of playing any sport or other activity they can be at home, library, or any other place studying. Focusing on their school work. Furthermore, the principle should change this school policy because the students will actually be getting their homework done. I am sure that if this C average school policy stays the same, most students will not be doing their homework, but if you change this their is a better chance of them doing this. Why you ask? well because most students will go home, drop their book bag on the floor and run out of their house again just to catch their practice for the sport they play. if this changes their would be a better chance for them to do their homework because if their not playing their sport, they will take the time to do their work. Now, don't you think that the principle should consider changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average? The principle doing this will have so many positives. For some doing this will influence their grades and the students will do their hardest to get their grades up. Also, students will study more. and lastly students will get their homework done. Now doesn't that sound great?      ","""Oh my god!"" Generic_Name yelled. ""I have soccer practice and I cant go because of this stupid extracurricular activity!"" In the next practice, the coach yelled at him saying that he should be at every practice. Generic_Name promised he wouldn't miss another practice, so he asked his principal if he could do the activity after his soccer practice. The principal accepted the offer and Generic_Name was relieved. So the next day, he joyfully went to practice and then went to go do his activity. When he got home, he was exhausted. He ate dinner and immediately went to bed because of how late it was. The next morning, when he went to school, he had a test and failed it because he had no energy to think. He even failed the homework because he had no time to work on it. Many students are experiencing the same problem as Generic_Name. Students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity because they have other things to do, it would take time out of their free time, and it would waste students' energy. Firstly, students have to do other things during the day. For example, when I was in fourth grade, I was forced to do chess club and I forgot to do laundry after school. On the next day, I had no clean clothes to wear so I was forced to go to school with dirty clothes. Later on that year, my friend had basketball practice and he couldnt go because he had to do drama instead. He and his mom got a call from his coach saying that he shouldn't miss practice ever again. Secondly, an extracurricular activity would take time out of a student's free time. To begin with, one day I had to do do an activity after school and when I got home, I ate dinner and I boringly went to sleep. A furthermore example is that my friend had to do archery after school and got home at eight o'clock. He then complained about not having enough time to play video games and was sent to his room to go to sleep. Finally, an extracurricular activity would waste students' energy. For example, one day I got home later than usual and went to bed late. On the next day, I barely had any energy to get up from bed, and I wasn't able to concentrate on a quiz, so I got a C. Additionally, my friend did football every day after school and he went home exhausted. In result of that, he slept in most of his classes and got yelled at most of the day. ""Soccer practice was fun, right Generic_Name"" his teammate asked. ""Yeah it was,"" he replied. In the next practice, the coach congratulated him because of how well he was playing. The next day he went to practice again and played perfectly well. He got home early and did his homework. He also had a good amount of time, so he played video games until dinner and went to sleep. The next morning, Generic_Name got a good grade on his test and also got a good grade on the homework. Because of this change, Generic_Name was able to improve academically and mentally. Many students could experience this too if they aren't forced to do extracurricular activities. Students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity because they have other things to do, it would take time out of their free time, and it would waste students' energy.","A Facial Action Coding System is where it sees if you're happy, sad, surpised, anger, digust, and fear. How? It will tell by have a picture of a no emotional , than compare to your see what's the diifference. Having Facial Action Coding System in the school, would be kinda great cause it would show the teachers what the student thinks about the assginment. Like, the Dr. Huang said ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'. But, the computer needs to understand that most communication is nonverbal, like emotional communication. But, than i'm against because how can the computer see what all the student are feeling like? Like, is going to look at every student face, if yes that had be a waste of time cause that would take the whole class period. If no, than do the teachers have to buy a Facial Action Coding System computer for every student. Finally, I think it would be a good idea because the teachers would know how the students are feeling by something they had said or asign. If I was a student, I'd like it cause that would be a good new expreince. ",,,,,,,
126,825,"dear senator, I have come to a conclusion on how I think the president and his candidates should be voted for. In one hand we've got the Electoral College, and the election by popular vote. These two thing have been around for hundreds of years but you've got to know if you prefer one or the other. So which one works better? Why do you prefer this one over the other? The Electoral College, electors meeting and voting for our president and vice president. This electoral college consist of 538 electors that vote to for our president. I myself dont think this is a very sensable thing. Because when you think you're voting for the president you are actually voting for a state of electors who will in turn vote for the president not you. Why should there be a select few people out of the billions of people who live in america to vote for the president while we just sit and wait for the results. To only have their opinions voiced. Does'nt seem like a very fair way to elect someone who will be changing our country. This is a winner-take-all-system. Election by popular vote, this means you and I will be voting for the president and his cabinet ourselves. That we will have a say in who we want to change or even fix our country. Although the person we vote for may not win, we still got a say in what we believe would have made our counrty a better place. Although the Electoral College might give a more clear winner, if we know that our vote will actually have an effect in the election we might pay more attention to the election and vote more wisely. Knowing that we have voiced our preference rather than knowing maybe one single electoral vote might have set the election. Now there are some benefits if the Electoral College. In the case of having a precise vote on who gets to be president is one. Also maybe the fact that you voted fo the people who will be electing the president in a way is just the same. However this does notmean that it is better than you just voting yourself. Because those are onlyabout the two thing that are evn remotely good about the Electoral College. So when you decide who you want to be president think of how you would like your vote to be heard. through your own vote or maybe/possibly through anothers vote. I know which system i would choose. Giving that it would give me more voicein the matter. What would you do?                                        ","When seeking multiple opinions people are giving you constructive curtism, even tho it might hurt you it will build you up to become something better then you already are, and more informed in what they think. When you tell someone your opinion, then they comment it helps you speak more informative. You need to tell your opinion to someone that you trust so they give you good feedback. When telling someone your opinion it is important that you listen, cause they might change you mind. Lets say you are running in the prisdentail election like Joe Biden and the people do not know were he stands in his views why vote for him, but when you know some of his opinions then that gives you a good reason to vote for him. When someone knows your opinion they might view it as the same thing that you do, so that can be a good convocation starter. It is good t know were someone stands cause they might view as the same but add on to it, so next time you will be more informed. Just know the next time you go to start a convocation that they know your opinion. I can't stress that enough. So the next time you start a convocation let them know were you stand. When you let someone go into there opinion it is good to know were theyy stand.","Some reasons why being a sea cowboy is a good idea. It is very occupational, working the stables and feeding the animals makes the trip seem less long. There are very many sights to see, such as, taking relaxing gondola rides in Venice, touring excavated sites like the elegant castles in Crete, seeing the famous Acropolis in Greece. There are many more exotic and beautiful structures to be seen as a Seagoing Cowboy. Along the way gift shops and antique stores that can be visited and bought from. Places like China are availible to visit and see. The program has all of these offers as well as delivering all of the animals that are on board with you. This is an even greater opportunity to young men who have just come out of high school, it can open things up for them. Help them realize and be aware, that there are other people who have needs in other countries. After it's all over, you can take another trip if you wish to. Being a sea cowboy means more than just moving animals from place to place. It helps others in need, people who have nearly nothing. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can make all the difference. That is why being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good career choice.                ","Dear Principle, I believe that the students should have a choice whether or not to do community service. Yes, it would be better if everyone helped out in some way, but we shouldn't have it mandatory. Those who disagree with community service should have a choice, because they wouldn't give 100% in everything that they do, and we would expect that from them. You also want all the students to enjoy helping the community. If they don't have fun with it, then why would they want to do it? If they like doing it, they will keep doing it. But, one way to get others who do not want do community service is to have them help out with areas in their interest. Such as, if a cheerleader didn't want to do community service, offer her to help out with younger cheerleaders. She would probably be interested, and there would be a high chance that she would do it. Otherwise, if you offer that type of community service to a football player, there is a low chance he would do it. Whether it be tutoring, babysitting, or picking up trash, if anyone feels the need to do good, they will. If not, someone else will. Thank you.","Dear principal I don't think that it would be right to make are good players have to get kicked of their teams because they have Cs or C+. i think that if they have a C- or lower they shouldn't be able to play but not B or higher its just not fair. also some kids i have a hard time in school but are good at sports and maybe are school needs some good players so we can win a few games. I'm just thinking that are players on any of our after school programs. Need to get cut a little slack or maybe we need less homework maybe that's the real problem here. That us students get over loaded with a lot of homework at school. And school and sports are hard to maintain after all we do try to get it all done but there's to much to handle with 8 classes and all. sports to some people mean nothing but to others they mean a lot some kids do sports to impress someone. Others because they are good also. Some are living up to someone in the family like a dad or grandpa, uncle for some of them that have Cs are gunna be really upset that they will be kicked off the team because they don't have a B average. So i don't think that you should do this to those kids that want to be on the team say they are good at the sport and they have won us lots of games we need students like that to make our school known in the other schools. So please don't make this a new rule lots of us will be sad that we wont have a team anymore...","Did you know that one of our students got 1000 dollars cash price because our principal put him in one of our school activity ! Our principal told us that we should participate in at least one of our school activity. First I did not like it. Then I thought of one kid that went to my school and got a 1000 dollars just because he was good at his activity. So I agree with this decision because students can get to know each other, students can a college degree, and it helps them learn new things. This activity can get students and new students to know each other. They can find there new best friend in there. New students can get out of there shy sell and can make new friends there. Even old students can make new friends there too. Probably the whole class room can become friends ! Kids can get to know each other more better if there in a school activity. If a student is good or great at there activity. They can also get a big college degree in it. Like Art or sports. there art work can go in a Art Show or in sports you can go in a big show ! Maybe you can get a college degree in any activity. Also can get money and a college degree. Students can learn new things in there school activity. Students don't know yet what and what not there good at yet. So students need to try out for these activates so they can know. Student can explore too. They still have time to try out new things and to find out what there good at. They might be good at drawing and they just don't know it yet. Probably your good at drawing too. Theses school activities can help you and your future out. Students can get to know each other more, students can get a collage degree, and students can learn new things. Students can get better in school with this and there future can be made with this too. I think this is going to be a good plan for students and kids.","Do you ever wish you could just look at someone and be able to tell how they are feeling? At the Beckman Istitute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois, Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague are created just that. they call it ""Facial Action Coding System"". This system could be put into computers to keep track of your emotions. Maybe even by tracking your emotions, you could be happier. The process works by using a 3-D computer of your face; all 44 major muscles. Than is the Facial Action Coding System associates the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnesswith each movement of the facial muscles. Most human communication is nonverbal, even through we may not relize it, we always show our emotions. The facial expression for each emotion are unviersal. Using the Facial Action Coding System, it can track humans emotion or even a painting such as the Mona Lisa. As humans we are always feeling something, weather its anger, saddness, or happiness. I think it would be of great value to have this technology at school, and put into our computers. Not all kids can learn the same way, which means kids can not be teached in the same way. If the student is working on the computer and they do not understand the lesson. The computer could change the lesson to teach it a differnt way. All in all, I think this kind of technology could be very useful, not only in school but for psychologist and other who study the human body. Our emotions say alot about us amd if that is how most of us communicate; we should know more about them.

126,901,"To whomever it may concern, The process of the Electoral College has been a problem for many years and deserves to be abolished at its roots. The Electoral College should not be kept due to the fact that not many Americans comprehend this legal process, swing vote catastrophies and other problems, and its lack of democratic pedigree. You may wonder why someone like me is even writing about this or why I even care, but I care about what happens in my country's economy and government, and others should too. First thing's first: knowledge. From personal experiences and research, you may realize that the majority of Americans in 2014 couldn't describe to you what the process of the Electoral College even is. Each state is different in this process, just like each opinion is different about this topic. This is an immensely confusing subject to read about, especially when you're just an average person watching the news or reading an article online. Although, let's be real for a minute: its really difficult. The process consists of selecting the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for our President and Vice President. Also, in school curriculum across the country, you never really go into depth about the Electoral College unless you're taking a hardcore government class. In this case, the students are yet to be informed about the causes and effects of the Electoral College and the disasters it can cause in our economy. Let's continue, shall we? The swing vote catastrophies, the worrying about who will be elected and whether or not they'll do a good job controlling our government, it's just not worth it. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election rather than the system that we use now. When citizens vote, they're basically voting for slates of electors, who then eventually vote to elect the President as well as the Vice President. The question is: Who are the electors? Who picks them? Are they responsible with the task at hand? The fact of the matter is that you really have no control over who the electors vote for. A ""faithless"" elector can vote for whomever they please, even if it isn't their party's candidate. This process is extremely unfair to voters across the country, and I doubt the phrase ""Life isn't fair"", a quote by my grandmother, would even apply to this discussion. As previously stated, the process of the Electoral College isn't the greatest of them all, nor is it fair to voters. I asked who the electors were, and who picks them... but where is the abundant democratic pedigree? To remind you, a democratic pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive to others. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational for our modern day concepts. This extensive process lacks alot of opinions, evidence, and background knowledge that is necessary when voting for candidates. On the other hand, there is usually a certainty of outcome in the election, and it avoids run-off elections which is pleasant to citizens who are for the Electoral College. What about the swing votes? What about the values? To wrap things up, the Electoral College is not needed in the United States government because of lack of understanding, disasters that may be caused, and the democratic pedigree and honesty that is nowhere to be found. I hope you consider my decisions and grow very fond of my reasonings. With great appreciation, PROPER_NAME                                                                                                                                                           ","Does seeking multiple opinions help you make a better choice? Seeking multiple opinions help you make a better choice because it's more helpful than asking for just one opinion, it gives you more knowledge, and you see others point of view. Seeking for multiple opinions is more helpful than seeking for just one opinion. Asking one person for their opinion wouldn't help you make a better choice. One opinion is not as much as multiple opinions. Multiple opinions have a bigger impact on your decision. The more opinions you get, changes the way you think about your decision and it helps you make the best one for you. Asking just one person for their opinion doesn't help you make a better choice but, asking multiple people does. You can be brought down by one opinion if it's negative but, if you ask for multiple opinions you can get some positive and some negative and both of them will help you decide what the right choice is. Seeking multiple opinions is better than seeking just one opinions because one persons opinion doesn't matter as much as multiple peoples opinion, multiple opinions have a bigger impact on your decision, asking for one opinion isn't as effective as asking for multiple opinions to make a better choice. You get more knowledge on the topic you are asking opinions for. More knowledge helps you make a wiser decision. If you are choosing your future career, advice/opinions will give you more knowledge on what you can chose and it will help you chose the best job for you. It changes the way you think. You hear all those opinions which tells you what people think and it could change the way you think. It helps approach a thought in a different way. When you ask for advice you are getting knowledge and it makes you approach a thought in a different way. More knowledge is important because it helps you make a wiser decision, changes the way you think, and helps approach a thought in a different way. Seeking many opinions help you see others point of view. It makes you question yourself. You keep asking yourself is this the right choice for me, which is a good thing because it helps you decide what's best for you. It helps you see how people think about your decision. You are able to see whether their opinion is something negative or positive. Others opinions make you either quit your goal or keep pushing towards it. Positive opinions will make you feel like your doing the right thing but, negative opinions will make you think your doing the wrong thing. Seeking multiple opinions is a good thing because it makes you question yourself, see the way other people think, see if your doing the right thing, and all of these make you chose the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions help you make a better choice because it's more helpful than asking for just one opinion, it gives you more knowledge, and you see others point of view. Seeking for multiple opinions is more helpful than seeking for one opinion. You get more knowledge on the topic you are asking opinions for. Seeking many opinions help you see others point of view. So do you think asking for multiple advice/opinions help you make a better choice?","Have you ever wanted to help people during war without joining the military well you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is where you get on a boat with other people and go to far places to get animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good way to help other country so there country's people can survive after war and other causes. On the Seagoing Cowboys program you can meet new people, and see new places and structures. You can also take animals from one country to another to give one country animals so they can make food so they all don't starve. You can also help make peoples lives better after war and acomplish great things. Just like Luke Bomberger who was just a average town boy then he joined the Seagoing Cowboys program because his friend then he became a hero. The Seagoing Cowboys program was created by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). The UNRRA was created during World War 2 in 1945 to help country's effected by World War 2 by destruction. The UNRRA helps by getting soldiers to help fight. They also search for food and animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps by getting horses,young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys program headed to Greece with a cargo of 335 and enough hay and oats to feed them. Joining the Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea if you want to help country's just like Luke Bombberger did by brining animals you can see different places and meet new people.","Dear Principal, I think everyone should have to do the community service. I think it is important for kids to be involved in that kind of work. It helps the community they live in and it helps them. If they did community service they would be able to put that on their things to get into college. It would help them get a better education and it would help the community stay clean. Kids and people both say that they don't have time because they are busy. They are busy doing what they want to do, not what they have to do. There is a difference! I am not saying that it is bad to do what you want sometimes but it's good to help out on your community. People that drive by throwing things out the windows are wrong. But we can make it clean if we just pick up a few things. If we had everyone working on it then each person wouldn't have to pick up that much. Kids and people need to learn that they can have fun and do what they want but also pick up and make the community look nicer. If you are one of the ones that is picking up then you need to get your friends to help out. You need to get all your friends together and help make your community a better place to live in. I think you, principal of this school should get them to learn that because if we could get friends and even parents to help out then I think we could make it beautiful outside. There is only one way to do that though, and that's to get everyone picking up around here. Don't only get kids but get parents too. Parents can help out even though they are not at the school. Simply telling them to stop throwing things out the window will help some. For all the reasons I have listed, I think you should make everyone help pick up. They are not too busy that they cant help the community. They can separate the hours they do what they want, what they have to do, and the time they spend making the place they live in a better one. Send out a letter saying that they need your help. Not just the kids but the parents too. Picking up the litter doesn't only save the land, but if you live by an ocean is saves the sharks, dolphin's, and many other water creatures. One person can't make all the difference, but getting everyone together and all helping out can. Anything is possible when you have everyone working for it. your student, STUDENT_NAME      ","Dear TEACHER_NAME My name is STUDENT_NAME other student's and myself have been not so happy with your decision on having at least a grade B average to play sports. Myself and a lot other student's average grade is a C. I think that is not the best idea for the eligible grade for sports. Students such as me need something to work for or to keep their grade up. Studies show that when a person is in a school sport, that the person wants to be in it makes the person work their hardest and get the best grades they can get. If you keep a chart and mark the grade down that people have in sports you will notice that it is high. But if you keep track of that person when their not on sports you will see their grade might be low. So if you let the grade average be a C for eligibility on sports it will give more students a chance of getting in that sport and keeping a high grade for that season. Thank you for taking your time to read this. Sincerely STUDENT_NAME","Dear Principal of Generic_School, Recently, you have stated that you will be enforcing a radical and possibly illegal new policy. This new policy will force every student to attend and participate in extracurricular activities. I would urge you to reconsider, here are a few reasons why. Many of our students that attend this school work jobs. You realistically cannot expect high school students to quit their jobs and stop making income. Especially when that income goes toward paying for college, helping their parents make rent, and supporting their families. Jobs help shape and mold young people, as it is a vital experience that makes them ready for an occupation. However, if you do choose to enforce this policy, many local businesses will suffer from unemployment. Another reason I am against this policy is that you are forcing students to do something that isn't required. After school programs are a great thing to students who are interested, but not to those who aren't. When you make someone do something against their will, the cons out weigh the pros. Those who aren't willing to learn, won't. As someone who has worked in the public school system, you must know this. You could make the argument that it's practically an extension of school, but it isn't. You cannot legally make students stay after 3:15, nor can you make teachers stay after 3:45. If you enforce this policy, it will only be a matter of time until upset parents will press charges against the school for illegally obtaining children. The biggest reason why this policy would not be viable, is our budget. As many of us students know, our school system is not in a safe financial state. We are already on a tight budget, and expanding our extracurricular programs to serve around 400 more people doesn't make sense. Especially now, when we are spending thousands of dollars to prepare for a global pandemic that has already brought many schools around us to their knees. It is clearly not the time to waste our money on something we would possibly get sued for enforcing, instead of spending it on something we need. This letter contains just a few reasons why I am against it. From unemployment to the legality, I hope I have changed your mind on this subject. And if not, I would surely wish you would be open to compromise. With concern, Generic_Name","I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it. This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

846,104,In the story the author says it's the brightist planet in space. And every space craft has been a failer that has landed. On it and they have acid clouds and your head can expload. And it's super super hot hoter than the sun even and they have very big storms and lightnign stikes. Even though it's very similer to Earth it's still very diffrent in meany ways. Even not being on the planet and just chillin above it you can still die but its hard to even study it. From above because how dens the planet it. But they are finding ways to go their but it's still very hard to study the planet. I think the way the author puts it is good they talk about how it looks like Earth like it have reveains rocks lakes and more. But they also explain how bad the condions are their. So even though i dont really care about space that much I think it would be cool. Because for all we know Venus could of had life on it at some point in life so their could be bones of some kind or if their still is life that would be very cool thats my conclusion.,"Many people, including nasa, believe that "" the Face"" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars. First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think. Secondly, the only reason it ""has"" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken. Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not. Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain. Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.","Distance learning, online classrooms, e-learning, whatever you want to call it, is a type of education that has been becoming popular as of late. A classroom where it is only you and the teacher, online. This type of learning is becoming popular for a reason, and thats because it is vastly better then the traditional classroom experience for a multitude of reasons. As distance learning allows the student with a larger selections of classes, no social distractions in the classroom, and a learning environment where you can work at your own pace, not being compared and worried about the students around you. The first reason why distance learning is superior to physical classrooms is the fact that distance learning has a much broader selection of classes. Unlike physical schools, online classes are not bound by courses that are taught. You can learn whatever interests you online, and actually develop knowledge in a field that, you might not have been to take in a physical school. Furthermore by being able to learn whatever subject interests them, students have a better path to college and a career, instead of being forced to learn about things that might prove useless to them in the future. Another reason why distance learning is beneficial to the student, is because the student is not being pulled in by social interactions. What are the two biggest problems in a classroom? Use of technology, and talking to other classmates. In an online classroom your on technology so thats fixed, and there is no one there to distract you from your learning. This improves the learning environment drastically, and allows kids to learn without distractions, and focus on their work. The Final reason why distance learning is good for the student is the aspect of school many kids stress about, grades. As long as I can remember students always showed their scores to one another, and compared report cards, and if somebody did bad on something, there was always torment dished out to that particular kid. With online classes this problem has been solved, students can work at their own pace, and not worry about how other kids are doing. Online classes have been proven to give students a better, and a safer place to learn without the pressures of others around them. In conclusion, distance learning is very beneficial to the students, and has the potential to be the new norm for public education. This type of learning brings new classes, and courses to those who might not have had those available to them because of the area they live in, providing students with a better path to a career. Distance learning also giving those same students to learn without peer distractions, making a more productive learning environment. Not only that but, students can work at their own pace, and dont have to worry about what other kids think, or how good they are doing. This is the future, this is the goal of a perfect learning environment.","Worldwide, more and more car companies have been introducing new products and services for the growing population. However, many places such as Vauban, Germany are now putting a pause on this polluting production with smart planning movements and new law enforcements. Motor vehicle companies have produced millions of new vehicles, all with the latest additives. Some, with bullet proof window, others with high speed turbo engines. Many csr lovers fancy the best cars and sometimes the most. Cars are the most used mode of transportation, used daily to get people from one place to another. Most have even looked to the future to see flying cars and such things as seen in cartoons and animations. Cars are an attraction for many. These car companies will have a negative outcome from this movement across the globe. Do we really need to take away the cars? Though cars are seen as an everyday tool, is it really safe? Scientists have proven that the smog from these car engines pollute the atmospher. Cold nights and warm days cause warmer layers of air to trap car emissions, polluting the very air we breath. Congestion contributes to the amount of emissions and also the hectic bundle att stoplights and highways. Some have also stated that congestion brings tension in people. Due to this damaged to the Earth, many organizations and countries have enforced laws and rules for a car-free environment. Places such as Vauban, Germany have forbidden any form of car storage and transporting. Paris bans car driving after days of near-record pollution and in Bogota, Colombua many left their car at home for a day to clear the streets and the air. These moements have seen progress woth reviews from many o how the smog free zones release the tension in the people and lower air pollution. In America, transportaion is the second largest source of emissions. President Barack Obama has plans to reduce this statistic. America's statistics shows that its people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer lincenses as each year goes by. This makes Obama's plan a step closer to being complete. Car usage can therefore be depleted and the atmosphere can be saved. Car companies will have a negative impact from this but these countries are seeing better results from it. Limting car usage is not the end of the world. More transportation is out there and the less cars, the less stress.    ","Phones and driving Many people follow the rules when driving and many people don't. There can be a lot of safety hazards when you are texting and operating a vehicle. Drivers need to be very careful when operating a vehicle because, they can put people's lives at risk. But, many people do not realize the safety concerns or that you should never use technology while driving. Research shows that texting and driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst case could kill other people. While many people are pretty good a multi-tasking, on the road is not the place to put this skill in use. Texting and driving not only requires keeping your eyes on the road but also a combination of motor skills, not to mention that there is already enough going on with traffic so why add the additional distraction. Trying to do too many things at once confuses the brain and makes it difficult to focus on driving and reaction time. For example, imagine driving on a busy road. You are going 65 mph staring down on your lap, as soon as you look up you crash into a car and you kill the person you hit. It would be your fault and you would have to suffer the consequences all because you wanted to text and drive. Researchers have come to prove that, Cell Phone Use While Driving Increases the Risk of an Accident. One out of 20 drivers use a cell phone when they're in the car, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). However, doing so makes you four times more likely to get into an accident. Texting while driving is even worse. In conclusion, texting and driving not only puts your life in danger but it also puts others life in danger. That's why when you drive your phone should be muted. Put aside all the distractions such as phones, loud music and headphones. Putting those things aside could prevent death while driving.   ","Dear Principle, Hello this STUDENT_NAME and I want you to require community service for our school. I believe that community service is a good thing. One reason why I think you should require community service is that it shows children and young teens good things to do. Another reason why I think you should require community service is that it benefits the community overall and makes things nicer for everybody. Also another reason why I think you should require community service is that it makes everybody much happier with a clean and nice community. Another reason why is that old people or people who are physically disabled may have a easier life with help from the community. My final reason why I think you should make community service required is that it could teach criminal or people who have run into trouble with the law a lesson by cleaning up the community. Thank you and please require community service for our school. Your Student, STUDENT_NAME","Imagine this: You are an adult looking back at your schooling experience. Were you in any clubs? If you were, chances are you have fond memories of that time. However, does that mean extracurricular activities should be required at school? Many people have strong opinions on the topic. Extracurricular activities should be required. One reason why clubs should be required in school is that being in a club provides skills that are extremely helpful throughout life. According to Brian Scott, an expert on youth development at the University of Social Sciences, extracurricular activities in school are some of the best ways that the youth can prepare to enter the working world. Scott explains that this is true because after school activities give kids further experience with important skills such as communication and team work. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Department of Youth Development found that 87% of adults who participated in extracurricular activities in school thought that being in an extracurricular activity gave them skills that helped them later in life. One possible reason why extracurricular activities could have helped people after they have completed their schooling experience is that it gave them important skills and character traits such as perseverance or good communication. All things considered, extracurricular activities give those who participate quality life skills. Another reason why after school activities should be required is that it gives the participants helpful experience. Evidence for this is found by the University of Statistics who conducted a study that found that 76% of people who were a part of extracurricular activities during their school experience thought that the experience from those clubs is helpful to them in their careers. Some ways that clubs can help in careers is it can give students experience in their chosen career path. Examples of clubs that are best at providing experience specific to future careers is the math club where students can participate in competitions or the newspaper club where students can practice for journalism. The experience students gain from joining extracurricular activities in school can also be helpful when applying to colleges, if students choose to go down that route. According to the board of applications for the prestigious College of Law, one of the top things they look for in an application is what extracurricular activities the applicant participated in while in school. One member even said, ""I value extracurriculars even more than the grade point average when I am decided who gets in."" As you can see, the experience gained from clubs in school has many benefits including college and job applications. Another reason why extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students is that it gives students an opportunity to make new friends with similar interests. The Department of Youth Statistics stated that one of the best ways for students to make friends is by letting students choose what activities to do and pairing those with similar interests together. That is exactly what clubs do. Furthermore, it is proven by the University of Psychology that when students have a healthy amount of friends, they are less likely to fail their classes and more likely to succeed. Based on that, extracurricular activities can cause students to be more successful than their peers who do not partake in those activities. However, some people argue that students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities in school. They cite people such as Jessica Grant, a professor from the West Virginia University of Psychological Studies, who said, ""when people have a choice in what they do, they tend to feel the benefits much more than those who are forced to do something."" While that might be true, students who are required to participate in at least one extracurricular do have a choice in what club or clubs they join. That choice is explained well by Dr. Matthew Brown, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington State who said, ""even when students are required to participate in something -- either a class or an activity -- they still always have some sort of choice, whether that is what activity to do or what mindset to have."" Using both sets of logic previously stated, when the students choose what club to participate in, they will experience the largest amount of positive results. All in all, a requirement in schools should be extracurricular activities. Clubs give students important life skills and experiences, as well as new friends. If clubs are required, then young adults would be much more prepared to transition out of school and in to the working world.",,,,,,,

"" Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" There are also things being done to help be safe while gaining information on venus. "" Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" All of this has shown that there are still chances to get to venus, there are reasons to want to go there, and there are things you can do for saftey there. So i agree that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.","""The Face"" is a land formation and my proof is that NASAHas sent astronauts in tospace to orbit Mars, and these astronauts ahve taken many pictrures. These picturesclearly show that it is a land formation. Also NASA has taken high resolution images and used 3D altimetry photos. The pictures they have taken with them clearly show that it is a land formation. Some information in the text states that when they put pictures of ""The face on the internet that it revealed a land formation. Other information statesthat theyb took photoes of ""The Face with digital images, which enhances the picture three times more than a pixel picture. It also statesthat that NASA took a photo with ""absolute maximum resolution. So this picture clearly depicts ""The Face"" as a land formation. Then the article goes on to say that if there were anything around ""The Face that it would be very clear and easy to see, such as airplanes,shacks, and pyramids. The article then says that it is the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Both of these examples are natural land formations made over time,and since that it has been proven of water on Mars what if the surrounding area of ""The Face"" eroded but ""The face didn't.","Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Attending classes from home would not be considered beneficial due having less access to many items they could get at a school building; including school materials, communication with other students and as well as communication with teachers. There are many materials a student need for their educational benefits. A lot of these materials are also expensive and difficult to use without the guidance of a physical teacher such as textbooks, measuring materials, graphing calculators, etc. Many of these materials are already in a school classroom, and the student has access to them for free. To spends hundreds of dollars for school material may be difficult for the student and the guardian providing for the students' needs. With each of these materials, they should be able to provide a better understanding to the content the student is learning. Often these materials are provided to schools by taxes, the community pays for materials that students use for their better understanding of whatever that subject may be. From obtaining these materials with taxes, students in that class will get a better understanding of the material they're learning, and will make their work easier to do. For example, having a graphing calculator in geometry. This is a needed material but prices can start off at $100. Not many students can simply make a huge purchase of a calculator. To have to study at home though, a graphing calculator will rarely be provided for that student, thus they have to pay that same price or even more. Students should be put into a classroom environment and surrounded by many types of people and things. Doing so teaches the student life and communication skills in which is very useful for life after their education. They will have access to group work and presentations which provides skills of teamwork and independence in the long run. Many have difficulty in communication skills due to limiting themselves to technology usage and relying on it in many ways, including avoiding communication skills. Often, students bury themselves in technology to avoid situations of talking to others due to the feeling of anxiety and having the constant fear of ""what do they think of me?"" mindset, and never proceeding to face that fear and talk to others. For students to use technology to get their education will further reduce the basic skills of communication by not having the ability of talking to others. Communication is a skill that takes many years to develop, often adults still struggle with that skill today. Since students spend most of their life learning, they should take those twelve years of education and also learn communication among each other and even adults around them. Having a classroom environment can also offer a better teaching and understanding of material one may learn. There would be better resources for an understanding such as a teacher going over the subject ""one on one"" with a student, and students around the individual who may have a better understanding of the topic. At home, a student is limited as to what they can do to have a better understanding of a subject they struggle in. They won't have access to ask their teacher what they are struggling in and if they do, it would be over technology and not physically there. Being physically there can allow both the teacher and student to have a better understanding of the question being asked and the question being solved or explained. Being in a school environment can also teach the student professionalism. Schools offer dress codes or uniforms not only for distractions, but to teach the students professionalism of their dress code and behavior. Being educated on professionalism and proper adequate can help when getting a job, have better offers/opportunities, and will overall take one seriously on an eye to eye level. This is beneficial if they are ever in a tight situation in life, in which is something can is rarely learned at home. To stay home and attend classes from there, students have the leisure of relaxing at home, not worrying about their appearance and gives an excuse to limit their hygiene, their manners, and ways of going out to public places. Schools can offer a student many opportunities to explore the future path they want to go in as well. Many offer extra curricular activities, in which include clubs, sports, or a simple gathering. Schools can also offer travel opportunities, many becoming exchange students, or simply going on a field trip. They often offer these for free or at a much lower price than if doing an extra curricular activity or traveling by oneself. Many schools also offer advice on financial aids for college. During spring or summer break, students can be sent to a college from their middle or high school to be offered many scholarship opportunities, and learn how to get scholarships and financial aid. Often, for participating in a club or sport, students can maintain a scholarship for their future as well. To have an education from home, these opportunities are often limited for that student. Participating in such can be very expensive, schools often get these prices much lower, and sometimes even free. This automatically limits opportunities for a student getting an education from home from scholarships, opportunities to know what career path they want and travel opportunities. Students would not have a benefit from getting an education from home. Communication skills between them, adults and other students would be stripped away from them, opportunities can be taken, expenses could be very high, and they could lack material for a better understanding. Having an education from home makes that student lose the ""high school student life"", and overall not receive the best education as they could.","Limiting car use can be helpful any many different ways. Ranging any where from helping the enviroment to making people less stressed. There has been many experiments to prove this such as car reduced communities, paris putting a partial driving ban on citizen for a week, bogota columbias annual car free day, and the studies in the united states showing that thier is less cars being bought now adays. So I believe that we should all started limiting our car uses not fully but deffinatly by some because theres has been nothing proven bad about the limiting of car use. If we all stopped using our cars so much or had certain days of the year where we weren't aloud to use our cars in the reduction of smog greatly. As shown in Vaunban, Germany where streets are completly ""car-free"" citizen have proven to be ""happier"" according to Heidrun Walter. Not only is it about making the citizens of this community happier but also about making the enviroment a better place by reducing emmision. Which can make the global community happier as a whole. The emmisions from the incresing number of private cars owned by the middle class is choking cities worldwide, and cities like Vaunban are the answer. Paris' ban on driving and Bogota's car-free day are also great solutions to the global greeenhouse gas crisis. In both places Paris and Bogota there was a fine in place for those who did not abide by the rules on these days. I think a fine is fair for those who disobey these rules because it isnt asking much to not drive your car for just one day. Plus in these experiments it has shown a good opportunity to take away stress which could be helpful in anyones life. It has also proven to be great for the economy bike paths being and even new restaraunts and shopping malls have popped up since the start of these car free days in Columbia. So from these articles I have yet to see a con be Produced from car free day and car free communities. Therefore I think every country should be held accountable to make its citizens participate in a day where driving is banned because this could helped decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted tramendously. Which would in turn help the global community as a whole.         ","In today's society cell phones and technology play a huge role in our lives on a daily basis. If you were to sit in a room full of people an if you were to look around at everyone you would see that almostly 95% of the room is occupied by their phone. Either searching the internet, on social media, or sending a text message to somebody but they are making use of their cell phones either way. Should drivers be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. No because people are deciding to use their phone at the wrong time. An there has been just to many deaths dealing with cell phones for ridiculous reason. We all know the feeling. you're driving and a text messages pops up on your cell phone. You have a reminder you wanna write down, and you really don't think about anything but picking up the phone. Within 5 seconds of looking at the phone , you could be halfway off the road, or already into an accident. Which may cause to injuries or even death. I just feel like whatever is on the phone, or whoever you texting is never that significant to cost somebody else life period. Many others will disagree with my opinion. But when you look deeper into it and really focus you'll understand where i'm coming from. When driving, sometimes it's really hard to keep all your focus on the road. Which leads into making it extremely easy to forget that the road is shared by others and not just for one person. For this reason all cell phones usage should be banned while driving. I found on [Teensafe, 2018] that everyday 9 people in america died from a car crash. That has something to do with texting or driving or even being on the phone, and about 3,278 people die in the past 4 years for the same reason. People are just losing their life because others want to be selfish and not think about their surrounding. Not intentionally trying to take life's but just not fully thinking out their action. Texting while driving as we all know, puts danger in many lives. A handful of youngins feels like staying attached to the outside world is way more well connected, than having all attention on the road. Altogether we just need to all stand on it to get a law passed about phone free while we are in our vehicles. In georgia has the same law it's called the hands free law. With this law being passed in atlanta georgia the accident rare, and also the death rate will decrease big time. When other states start to realise hopefully they do the same thing. Using a cellphone while driving really does put multiple people's life in danger. It's time to put all distractions aside, and focus on what's really important when it comes to driving. As we all know phones have came a long way from generation to generation, and it is interfering in many lives. It's time to stand up for the safety of your life and the people around you. It could be someone in your family in an accident, it could be you. Just by making one change in your life , it can save your life . put the phones down, it can't be more important than a life.                                ","Dear Mr. Principal I think it would be a good thing for us teens to do community service because it will give us something to do after school of stand of going home doing nothing. I also think that we should have field trips going to homeless neighbor hood and helping teens ,kids ,and other people it would be really fun. We should go and serve them food and give them toys , gifts, clothes, and shoes. We should also try to take them to Disney land or castle park some where they can have fun and see things they never saw. Well my friends don't think it will be fun but i think it will be a really good time. I think they should give us a grade on community service because when they get home nothing to do all they do is get on the phone call their friends and eat and watch television. So that's why i think it would be a good thing to do. So that's why i think we should do community service i think it will be really fun to do. i hope really get a chance to do something like this cause it looks really fun. This one more reason it would help the family's that really need it and that's what community service is about. That's why we should do it would help us on are school recorder.","I think it's a great idea to at least let students participate in one extracurricular activity. It would change things a lot but maybe for the greater. I thinks it's a good idea because students can participate in something they never did before, but I wouldn't say they must participate. I say it's more of a choice than to make them do it unless they willfully agree. I think this would change the school, it's students, and the students activities. I would love to see how doing something like this would effect effect the school. It's going to be a good chance to see what he school can benefit from this. The school would definitely change because there are more students participating in things like the schools tennis team, student council, or a book reading group. Overall this would have some positive effects like more students joining more activities, but sooner or later this might get out of hand. What I mean is that id people want to join a certain group they really like they might not be able because there isnt enough room. This might not be a good out look on the school id students cant join their favorite activity. Doing this would change the students a lot depending on what activity they do. Me personally since I've been playing tennis has changed my social life at school. Now that I'm busy practicing and getting ready for my first match coming up I dont really have time for drama and other things that can get me in trouble which is why I'm sticking to playing sports because it keeps me busy and out of trouble. Honestly this has made me a better person and i've also made friends with all the players on my team. More students starting to join activities will have to change the activities themselves because if more students are joining more teams the teams will eventually have to stop accepting students because they might be able to fit a few more students than average but then the team would get full. That doesnt mean you have to stop there will be many other options to choose from which mean you can do anything else you like but you know if they dont have somethings you like you can always make you own group. I think this would be a good thing to do since it can change things like the school, it's students, and extracurricular activities can benefit from doing this. I just like the over idea i think it a great opportunity the let students experience things they never did before and i total agree with the idea of letting students participate in extracurricular activities.",,,,,,,
846,901,"Ill be sumerizing the article over venus and why it is not we can not step foot on this planet. It says in paragraph two that venus is drapped in clouds and that the un manned ships that have been send did not last more that 2 hours. That is whay no man has ever steped foot on Venus. Venus is a chellenging planet the last time a space craft touched down was 3 decades. Beyond high pressureand heat, eupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikesto probes seeking to land on its surface. If Venus is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing visits to its surface. Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may have been much like earth long ago. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallies, mountains, and craters. Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the the planet itself. also because human curiosity will likelylead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.         ","The Face on Mar couldn't been made by aliens. The monument was another natural formation. It is stated in the fourth passage, that it is giving an illusion to the shadows and making it look like it has eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Evidence say in the fifth passage say that NASA would wather hide, and say that conspiracy theorists. The monument has properties tht make it look like is has a natural human face. The shadows give it a 3D effect to look like a person from Earth. to eally see that it is not a face you will need to focuse on the picture, to not let the shadow make you think it is a face. The face is only a illusion of the mind, some people say the face looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA thinks that if there were a alien civilization on Mars that it would be a popularity increase for the big red planet. People that still think that their was life on Mars defend by saying that it would help the budget for themselves. The Face on Mars became popular and started to get on talk show, radios, and magazines. Soon NASA wanted to let the conspircy take place and leave the Face alone. The Face of Mars could have been made by alien because of the unexplainable things on Earth itself. In the last passage it states that i could have been made bye aliens. Compared to all of the things on Earth. It could be a possiblity of aliens making the Face on Mars. For example, in the last passage it says that Garvins say, ""That it slike the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on a Mars."" In conclusion, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and there for the case of the Face on Mars was a natural monument after all. It compared to West America for all of the weird thing that they have. ","Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades. One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student's schedule. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. The students can focus on their studies. When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. Learning from home won't have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won't stress about work. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This is not help a student's learning at all. On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want. There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. There are many more opportunities with public schools. People from different colleges don't go to students'homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do. My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a student's work.","In Vauban, Germany many people have given up thier cars. Residents saying that they find that there are many advantages to not owning a car. Such as reducing the gas emissions from tailpipes, saving money, and being much happier. For instance, an advantage of not having a car is a decrease in gas emission. In the article ""Car Free Cities""  its sites ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United Stated."" This shows that cars are infecting our greenhouses with gases and potentionaly harming us. Furthermore, not owning a car will save you money. In the article it states ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" That statement shows that it's not really reasonable to own a car when you have to pay to park. Lastly, people in the article say they are much happier after they sold thier car to live there. There a woman named Heidrun Walter who says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this statement shows that residents of Vauban like separating suburban life from auto use. To conclude, there are many reasons why the residents of Vauban, Germany have given up there cars. They benefit from many advantages such as reduced gas emissions, saving money, and being much happier in their life. in the end there many advantages to living in Vauban.     ","We have been using cell phones on a daily basis that we've gotten used to it, but people think they will be able to drive normally even if they are using their phone. Well, they are wrong, using phones while driving lead too many people in car accidents, killing other people, and you'll be fined much money, even if you don't crash or anything like that. People shouldn't be allowed to drive and use their phone for theirs and others safety. While many people think using their phone while driving isn't hard, but there have been tons of accidents because of people using their phones while driving. ""In 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers."" This shows that car accidents are now a more commonly known way people die. Usually, a car accident only involves 3 or 4 people are involved so if the number of killed and injured are so high then that shows that the number of car accidents is also high. That shows that people can't be on their phones and driving. Driving and usage of phones do cause accidents; it could also cause the driver to run over people. ""A staggering 37,461 people were killed on US roads in 2016, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous year, according to just-released statistics from the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration."" All of these accidents have occurred ever since phones came out and that's because we all think we are able to multitask. When it comes to driving we need all of our attention on it and not anywhere else because then we don't see people crossing the road. All these deaths are being cause by the fact that we can't leave our phones until we get to our destination. After many years of distracted driving the US is finally doing something about it, they instated a law that if you are caught using your phone or it's just in your lap you'll be fined. ""Motorists operating commercial vehicles who violated the distracted driving law are subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,750."" That may seem too much money for a small thing, but it could save many lives including your own. Using your phone won't only get you fined, it'll also get your license suspended, which you won't be getting back for a long time. With just one time using your phone while driving will take your money, which you worked hard to get. In conclusion, people should learn that using their phone while driving will only lead to bad things. Even if it's the first time you've used your phone while driving, you'll get the same consequences as if it was done in the past. ""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving.""

I am pretty sure that alot of other teenagers would think the same exact thing and if the principle tried to make it any longer i think that everybody would go on strike.","Imagine your'e principal made extracurricular activities outside of school mandatory, activities outside of school can be a good way to socialize with your'e peer's, but there are some drawbacks to forced extracurricular activities. Activities outside of school can be a good thing if they are willingly done by the person, compared to being forced into doing an activity. Studies have shown that if someone is forced into doing a selected activity, they wouldn't enjoy it as much as they would compared to the person doing the activity willingly. Some student's already are doing things outside of school such as, helping at their local food bank, volunteering at their church, or they could just be leading a small study group. There are some student's out there that aren't interested in doing anything outside of school either because they can't or they just don't want to do anything after dismissal time. For some student's, activities outside of school could really help their social skills by exposing them to a new environment, with new people, and new challenges to face. In conclusion doing things outside of school could be a good thing for students if they do it willingly and if there are many options to choose from,not just activities associated with school, but continuous activities in the community too. When doing activities outside of school there can be many things to choose from. Some activities that student's can get involved in outside of school may include volunteering at a local non-profit, organizing a study group, or it could be as simple as doing a sport, the possibilities are virtually endless! If your'e principal made it so that the extracurricular activity was some how associated with school, there are still plenty of options out there. Some activities that may be associated with your'e local school may include sports, yearbook club,National Junior Honor Society, or even a chess club, there is still a lot you can do after school, but not as many activities you could do that isn't associated with school. There are some districts that have already implemented this into their schools, which for most of the schools they had to add more clubs that fit the students interests. A resent study shows that the students who did extracurricular activities preformed better on a social IQ test compared to students who didn't do any activities outside of school. If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, thats why it would be best if the school system stayed the same with a few minor changes to the systems. Activities can be healthy for students, if the students like what they are doing. Students may not want to do things after school, except to just go home. While there are some kids who absolutely love to do things outside of school because it can be a good social experience for them. A survey recently done by a New York institute, seventy five percent of the time when teens are forced into something they resent and do the opposite of what is told of them. To sum every thing up, The school systems should allow the students to have free choice of what they do, schools need to make the kids of tomorrow more independent and allow them to choice their own path of what they want to do.",,,,,,,
963,104,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, The phone is a true necessity indeed. It has established world wide communication, saved lives, and brought further advancement in technology. So what do I think of the phone? I believe it is a true tool indeed, and that it should be allowed in school, but only during free time. This is because phones help students communicate with their parents if they left something at home or need something, and the phone can also help improve student relationships by reducing social boundaries. Although you may say that the phone can increase bullying and other problems like sex ting, the technology that is available today can help diminish that by adding censors and what not. Let's say this, OTHER_NAME has left his language arts homework at home because he heard his bus roaring down the road and he had just woke up. So what does he do? Most likely it's rush out the door with as much of his essentials as possible, but he accidentally forgot his homework on his work desk. So as OTHER_NAME arrives at school, he shuffles through his book bag and notices that his homework is missing, and the school's late work policy is cruel, stating that if work is late just one day, then it will not be accepted, but OTHER_NAME here is very lucky, his language arts class is after one of the free time periods and he has a cell phone. So what does he do? He calls his parents for help and soon his mom comes to school with his homework and he gets an A. This goes to show how beneficial cell phones are at school during free time, but then, during the second free time of the day (lunch time), OTHER_NAME doesn't have anybody to sit with. Cell phones were originally designed for increased communication, but now with the introduction of new smart phones with instant messaging and other cool applications, they are now a social and business tool. OTHER_NAME here can text his friends during lunch and say, ""Hey, I'm sitting at lunch table B, come and join me over here so we can chat."" So being his friends, they would most likely come over to his table and accompany him during lunch. So by the end of the day, everybody is happy. Except for the big, bad bully OTHER_NAME who was jealous of OTHER_NAME and his friends. OTHER_NAME, being the bully he is, begins to go onto Face book during locker break (also a free time) and he begins posting horrible things onto OTHER_NAME 's wall. This might be your counter argument, but this isn't a strong argument. With the technology today, school's can place censors on radio waves. Meaning that if OTHER_NAME here goes onto Face Book and posts, ""OTHER_NAME is such an idiot ."" Then the censor will detect that and immediately terminate the post. Therefore keeping evil at bay. As you can see, communication is an extremely vital tool for the success of further improving the academic system and social system, and this means that Policy 1 (Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) is the best choice for students academically and socially. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Over many years, the school system implemented little changes effecting the way students work and study. Stress is a major factor within high schools today. With online school, students have the opportunity to create less stress around school and more time to finish homework. Students are also able to have more time for doing activities they enjoy, like extracurricular clubs and sports. Online school gives students the opportunity to get more sleep and have more time for homework. Almost every high school student struggles with getting enough sleep. Many articles suggest that a child's brain is not ready for the day until 10am. Pursuing classes online gives a child more time to sleep, and creates a better learning environment so the student can be fully engaged for learning. Many students are involved in ACT and SAT preparation that is a necessity for their future. Online school will give the student more time to complete what they need. Teachers will also get an option to have more time to plan lessons for the children. Online school is very beneficial to students because of the extra time for sleep and homework that can take away from their daily lives. Many students are involved in after school clubs, sports, and other activities that put a hold on their homework. With online school, these students will be able to have more time to complete homework, go to more club meetings, and participate in their desired sport. Video conference meetings with teachers will give them the ability to ask more questions and engage in the material more so they understand it and, consequently, receive better grades. Without extracurricular like sports and clubs, the stress piles on and becomes too much for children to handle. Many people say that the preexisting way school is taught is adequate and should not be changed, but in the world today, many new advances in technology offer better teaching styles and more time for students to compete homework. Overall, online school is a great way to engage students and provide them with more time for homework and extracurricular activities. Many students struggle with getting the right around of sleep which hinders their growth and overall, effects their happiness. Online school is a great solution for students who have responsibilities outside of school. Many people say that the way school is taught now is fine the way it is, but from a child's perspective, many changes could be made to benefit the well being of students today, and online school is a great opportunity.","Dear principle, I strongly feel like having community service would be a really a helpful way because our school would be clean, we could help our earth from preventing global warming and it would look like we are clean students. The way it would be clean is if every student would clean up there mess and not just throw there trash on the floor. I personally think that throwing your trash on the floor would be stupid and it wouldn't be a good thing, people are more mature and know not to throw it on the ground you can actually get into deep trouble and would have to pay a fine, so that was my first reason, why we should have community service. My second reason is that we could prevent global warming and our earth can die easily, even though on the streets there is trash i sometimes pick it up, it can also effect the sea creatures because they could get stuck in whatever u don't throw away. My third reason is that it would be much cleaner and people out of school would get the idea that this is a good school for my child or children. so we should keep our schools clean and help the earth to be a better place so want to keep the our earth clean or make it an uglier place for us to live in. And who cares if u would waste time just keep your city clean and your neighborhood also parks. Parks get ruined when they are not clean and it wouldn't be a nice place where kids could play. so i consider you having community service for the students.","Phone and Driving In recent years, there have been more reports about distraction while driving and the death rate increase, the ""National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

I know that grades are more important then participating in sports but keeping a c average is what is required from all students so if students are maintaining a c average they should be allowed to participate in sports. The students that participate in sports try very hard to keep up th It's great for students to take part in a sport or athletic activity because they are getting a lot of exercise and helping their bodies. When a student is athletic their keeping themselves healthy. It's important for students to get their bodies active after sitting down in classes all day. Through sports not only develop healthy bodies but we develop our skills as being a team member. When you are on a sports team you learn to work together with other people as a team. When you become a member of a team you are not only becoming team members but you are becoming friends with everyone. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you take my thoughts into consideration when you make your decision. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Living in a community without the use of cars can be extremely beneficial. It might seem odd to say such an idea because we have lived in towns with alot of car usage all of our lives. Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car can be very stressless. This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it (such as oil changes) and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive. Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the enviornment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This number keeps on climbing because more and more people are buying cars which just puts more gas into the enviornment. An even greater benefit of living in a community without cars is that you can get more excercise. Sitting in the car everyday going to and from work for 2 hours is not being productive. However, in the existing car-free communities, all the necessary store are in walking or biking distance from the majority of the population. So, the commute to work for most people can be just like getting a daily exercise and staying in shape. In conclusion, I firmly beleive that living in a community without cars would be a change for the better. It would help with everyones finanical situations and everyone would have better health because you would have to bike and walk everywhere. As of lately, it has seemed like less and less people have started to use cars. The number of miles drivn peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since. In April, 2013 the average number of miles driven was 9 percent below the peak in 2005.                     ","Many students have expressed that projects should not be given over summer break. Students feel they should not have to do work during their summer break, Just as much as teachers shouldnt not have to grade papers over their summer break, If summer projects must be assigned they should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because the students would know how to complete the assignment, they would also find more interest, and more then likely the project would be completed with effort. Over the summer most students are sent home with no instruction or contact availability. Students would attempt to do the assignment with no teacher guidance or help from others. With out the proper help the project could be completed wrong and completed with out any effort. When attempting to do my own summer project I stumbled into a problem and had no way to correct the problem, If summer projects were student made there are no excuses for not understanding how to complete the work. Every student has a least favorite class, many would complain about a summer project from a boring or hard class. More students are likely to complete something that is more appealing to them personally. For example art is a more appealing subject to one, while someone else could be interested in history. Making your own project could be more intriguing which will make someone want to actually do the assignment they have created. Majority of high school student do not complete their summer project. When a student completes the work it is more for the grade then personal gain. With the option to have students create their own projects brings creativity, interest, and effort. Many individuals put more effort into their own creations like art, putting more effort will cause more learning for the students personal gain, and the projects would be done nicely. Many schools require summer projects to be completed. These projects would be more beneficial if students were able to create their own assignment. The idea of student designed projects are more beneficial because students would know how to complete the work, they would find more interest, and the project would be completed with more effort put into it. ",,,,,,,
963,825,"Dear Principal, Ever think about how dangerous school can be? Having a cell phone there with you can be a big help. When students have emergencies, need a break from school work and just to have on the bus ride to and from school. Having a cell phone at school shouldn't be a big deal. I mean everybody gets and has a cell phone at one time. When you where in school I'm sure you had a cell phone at least once in school. There no big deal if there not used in class while being taught. Beep, beep ,beep the fire trucks rush to the school. In this case if 20% out of 100 students don't have a phone, its going to be a big problem. Everybody is going to be going crazy trying to call there parents to tell them the problem and where they are located. If you let student bring there cell phones to school on a day to day basis, problems like this wouldn't occur in a disorderly fashion. Ring, ring . Students all around eating, drinking and laughing at lunch. There's nothing a teacher can do because the students are not in a classroom teaching at the moment. Having free time at lunch and in between class should consider that students can have there phone out because everyday would go by much better. Instead of parents coming to the school being loud about why you took there child's cell phone. Red light ,green light, yellow . On this bus early in the morning nobody wants to just sit and listen to those loud out of hand children. Well i know i don't every morning and afternoon. So bring phones to school would be a plus for students. The could listen to there music on there phones on the bus to and from school. If you asked a number of student would they prefer cell phones at certain points in school or no cell phones at all. More than half of your student would prefer cell phones at certain times of the day. Also some student work better if they are listening to music or something soothing and not all the loud talking in the background. All in all cell phones at school only during lunch will satisfy the students more. I'm pretty sure more of the students grades would improve if they have something to look forward to doing at lunch and other free time in school. So principal i hope my words have encouraged you to think about having cell phones in school during lunch and free periods of the day. I'm sure whatever you decide will be for the better. Remember everybody should have a chance to prove someone right or wrong. It wouldn't be so bad if you gave the cell phone in school a try for at least a week or two.","Schools all over the world are making education more accessible each and every year. Most schools have online websites where school based information is published, and schools have interactive classrooms where students may turn in their assignments. Although technological advancements are providing learning opportunities, these opportunities should not be exploited. Growing in popularity, school districts are accepting students to take stay-at-home online classes, and the schools provide them all the material online. Students will not benefit from attending online courses instead of normal classroom classes due to less concentration, less peer involvement, and limited learning variety online. Students achieve greater accomplishments when they are fully concentrated, not when they are laying distracted on their beds. Although students commit to attending the online courses, the environment in which they study in sometimes is not a guaranteed adequate learning location. For example, if students have pets or younger siblings in their households; the students will not be fully engaged if the pet or sibling is entertaining the student. A school campus, a resourceful learning location, is a better and more useful learning place when being compared to someones home or comfort place. Another concentration concern would be the inability to interact through online classes. When students stop a fluent rhythm of learning, they zone out and find something to do that entertains them. This would unbalance the online class' pace with the student's pace. Once students are out of focus, the only ones not benefiting are the students who are not at school learning in the classroom. With limited concentration and lack of focus in a non school environment, there is only one factor that hurts the student's learning ability more. This is the lack of student-on-student involvement. Without other students, the limit is set extremely low on the personal growth of the learner. When there is peer involvement, there is growth in the character and intelligence of the person. This kind of negative influence on students also adds to the very limited learning experience online. Most of the learning factors that make a well rounded student are not present. For example, the interaction between a teacher and a student will be blunt and simple instead of a face-to-face learning experience. Peer discussions are also limited because there might not be any time for an in depth discussion like there would be in a regular classroom. Peer involvement builds relationships that influence learning in a healthy environment. These normal student acts will be limited if the classes are based in online servers instead of the classroom. Students will not benefit from online courses more than they will from attending the classroom. The lack of concentration and peer involvement show how limited a student's learning experience will be when taking online courses. The disturbance in the pace of the student when at home affects the overall results and accuracy of where the student is placed. Although the technology that is at the school board's disposal is useful, in many different and meaningful ways could be a distraction to the learning of the youth. Counties providing online schooling not only take away from the student's learning ability but also take away from the full potential of the class. Students receive a full, interacting, and educational experience at school, they should not take on the non beneficial online alternative.","Dear Principal, I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision. Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people. There are many things us as students can do such as: reading to the elderly, babysitting, and picking up litter from the parks or streets but also children like to have time to do fun things. Children always want to have fun by playing with toys, going to a boiling alley, or going to see a movie but life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service. I, as a student, have always done community service because it makes me feel like i have accomplished something important and because i have helped my community in someway while also having fun. So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life. Yours truly, STUDENT_NAME","Phone's & Driving essay In today's life our cellphones are the key to help us with everything we do such as, keep our plans together, keep people connected, alarm, and plenty of other things. Even though cellphones have not been around for a long time It is still a well known fact that our cellphones are a big distraction even when driving. When driving u should be alert and pay attention to all surroundings and while being on your phone u can lose focus and cause a accident. So to answer the question no u should not use a cellphone when driving. In our current days we have become so focused on how much we can do at once that start to risk our personal safety because no matter where we go we cannot put our phones. We all know some stories of people texting while driving and causing accidents that's how you know that texting while driving is a very dangerous task. To make things clear when u start to text you are putting the lives of other people in your hands because u are careless to pay attention to the road at all times. Everyday their is a report of someone dying to a driver texting and driving. It's know that cellphones are the key factor that cause accidents. It doesn't matter what u tell people about the issue they will still use the cellphones and that's not okay because I don't feel safe just by walking down the street and a person hits me because they are not paying attention. I don't feel like my life should be in there hands. Some say maybe they are on a emergency call but you can put the phone on speaker without holding the phone to your ear and not driving with full control over the vehicle. To put it all in perspective if we don't give up cellphones for our own safety the number of accidents will only increase. It's up to the people to take responsibility on this issue. People should just put the phones down get to there destination and then continue to use your phone. So to finish my essay I agree that yes we should not use cellphones when driving.         ","To the principal: I do not agree with the proposed change to the policy affecting the minimum grade of student/athletes. Assuming that you have that power, I believe that changing the minimum GPA would not improve the grades of those people that you would have labeled ineligible to play sports for the school. If they are forced out of sports, they may turn to other activities that interest them to replace playing sports for our school, and the new activity is unlikely to be studying or doing homework. While I am a student/athlete, I am a straight-A student, so it is unlikely that I would be directly affected by this change in the rules. Many of the people who would be affected by the change would not be positively influenced by being kicked off their sports team. Some people simply can't or won't be a B average student, because of many factors weighing on them, besides the sport they play. If the rules were changed, then our athletics teams would lose many good players, which would give rival schools a clear advantage over ours in regards to the size and quality of sports teams. If i were to be kicked out of a sports team, the first thing I would do is go and sign up for a non-school-sponsored league and play in it, and I think a lot of my peers would be likely to do the same if they were put in that situation. If some people just aren't able to excel in school, but do excel in sports, changing the minimum average would be a sort of discrimination. I understand that someone's grades may be more important to you than sports, but every student is different, and some may be content to simply graduate as an average student from this school and move on to the next level in their athletics career, and you shouldn't take advantage of your power by changing their eligibility to play on an athletics team. Not everyone wishes to grow up and be an intellectually inclined person, as you are, and teaching the basics to everyone is this school's job. And choosing their own path, whether it be as a scholar or an athlete, should be their's.","For most people it is more common to get from place to place by hopping in a car. But, what if we never used cars, or at least limited them? Lives would be inpacted in a very positive way. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paris bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer, Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata , by Andrew Selsky, and The End of Car Culture , by Elisabeth Rosenthal the authors show how cars are not a neccesity to life and how our communities can even be better off without them. Because of the positive impact on our enviroment and the increase of a community, limiting car usage is a serious idea worty of a second look. Cars, especially in America, are a major source of transportation. Without them many people would not have an easy way to commute to where they need to be. But, convience is causing more pain than pleasure and startign to harm our enviroment. Cars just by themselves cause around fifty percent of the greenhouse gases that are emited into the atmospere. Similarly they cause twelve percent in Europe (par. 5) Logically it would make sense to find the root of a problem and change it to make the problem go away, but in the case of cars, cars are a root in the pollution problem, but many people need them to ge to get where they need to be. The easiest solution to this is to limit our car use and add more busses and easier, more acessable areas for bikes and walking. Pollution will lower and people will still get to where they need to be. Pollution is a major topic regarding the safety of our enviroment and cars have been a proven source of much of the pollution in the air. Using less cars coensides with less pollution in our surroundings. Paris, France was suffering from very high pollution in the air. To combat this, for five days certain people, based on their lisecense plate number, were not allowed to use their cars. Though not everyone complied, after the five days the smog went from the levels found in the worst city for pollution, Beijing China, down by sixty percent (par.14). In just under a week Paris went from being the most polluted it had ever been to a better, safer level. If a city just by limiting the car usage by half was able to make such a drastic difference in that time, imagine it being limited more over a wider area. There is a possibility of totally correcting the pollution problem worldwide, or at least making it better and more easily handled. Although the enviroment is important, cars are also affecting the way we interact as people in a community. Because we have cars, we never really see the senery around us. We exit our houses, jump in our cars, drive, and walk ito our destination. There is no contact with nature or other people passing by. Limiting cars can lead to the increase of interaction and better looking cities. In Bogota, there is a day once a year called ""car-free day"", in which no one is allowed any use of their personal cars and fined if they do not comply. Because of this there has been an increase in new high-end resturants and places to shop. The community has also added more city parks and places for sports. There is no traffic rush hour and due to the increased walking the old broken sidewalks have been replaced with larger new ones (par.28). No one wants to not only have to walk, but have to walk on a surface that is hard to walk on and unappealing. Due to this, people started to create parks and sports centers for a nice place to be as well as a nice place to look at. And because of the increased foot traffic, there have been more people opening shops and resturants, as no one speeding by in a car will notice a small corner store, but someone strolling by, taking in the scenery will. In response to the increased foot traffic, it is important that there is somewhere to actually put your foot, and old cracked pavement won't cut it. If there are less cars, less road pavement is needed and more sidewalk pavement is. So, the old pavement is replaced with more pavement that is in better shape. All the walking and passing people causes people to be more social and to interact more often. The members of a community are more together. Mr. Sivak, a researcher, had noticed both of his children are not interested in getting a driver's licence. Everything they do is centered around walking, public transport, and carpooling. They don't find it necissary to have a car and licence (par. 39). The children of the researcher don't have or need a car because what they do doesn't require them to have one. They get a more full experience not being in a car all the time. In a carpool they get to socialize with friends and while walking they get an outdoor and community experience. In short, cars are an easy way to get from area to area, but they are very harful to the enviroment and our community. They add pollution to the air and cut off our everyday contact. If we limited the use of cars we would lower pollution, casuse our cities to be more attractive, have better ways of transport, and be closer as people in an area. So, is a car still going to be your most common way of transport? Think of the good you would do to the world if it wasn't.    ","Students should be able to design their own summer project because, it give them a chance to have something to look forward to in the summer. Also it would help them get a chance at experiencing their own creativity. Students would be able to have that feeling that they are able to take on the responsibility. They would be able to learn more if they can designed it all on their own. For must students they dont really look forward to doing project but if you give them a chance to do it on their own they might get into it. First, designing your own project as a student it give you something to look forward to in the summer. Most students stay home for the summer with nothing to do. So, if you give a student a chance to design their own project for the summer it give them a chance to do something. Students would be able to explore more if they design their own project. With exploring their not sitting at home eating a bag of chips watching Netflix they are actually being active and moving around. Although, most teachers believes it is a bad idea for students to design they own project because they believe they will not take it seriously. It actually the opposite half of any schools in the world may have students who is into art or into designing things. It would give students a chance to express their own creativity. Most students love the thought of making their own projects. They would learn more and discover more with making their own project and designing it the way that they prefer it to be. Also, letting students design their won project would let them discover more. With discovering they are able to learn more and see thing that they never seen. Example say your in are and you art teacher give you a summer project. And that project is to take a pic of what you think expresses people in the world. You would have to get out your comfort zone to do that like going outside. it would also be a better way to communicate with people to gain information for your project. Furthermore, teachers would want for their students to take on that responsibility to prove that they are ready to work for their grade. It would also give kids the feeling that they are capable of taking on the responsibility of proving to there teacher next year that they are responsible. Kids have a hard time showing that they can do stuff in a responsible manner. So, giving kids that responsibility of designing their project it's letting them know that it is their job to make sure they have everything they need for the project and knowing that they are capable of doing that. It would teach kids that even though it is summer your still able to learn and have responsibilities. With that being said it is a good idea for kids to be able to design their own summer project because they are still learning. And they would have something to look forward to when summer comes. It would be a great way to experience their creativity. Also, students are able to prove to themselves and teacher that they are responsible. Letting students design their own project could give them a chance to discover and have a chance to express their own creativity.",,,,,,,
963,901,Dear principal You should allow students to brings cell phones to school because you never know what could happened to them. Because something could happened to them or to someone else after school and there's no way to contact for help. And so like if there ride ain't coming after school they could call them to let them know. Another reason why they should bring their phones to school is so they could have there own time like during lunch. Because during lunch is when they get to talk so why just not let them use their phone. And so they could know about everything and no be in class looking through their phones trying to know what's going on. and like if the teacher gives them free time that will be a good time to let them check their phones. And let them use them before school like in breakfast. And if they get caught using it during class they should get a warning next time.,"When Generic_Name was diagnosed with with Chrons disease she had no choice but to be admitted to the hospital while they figured out how to best treat her, she missed a whole month of school during that time. Although some may believe otherwise students should be able to attend classes from home because of chronic illnesses, other health issues, and some may learn better that way. Some students may have chronic illnesses that require them to either be in the hospital or at home. Most people with chronic issues have good or bad days, when someone has a bad day they might not even be able to get out of bed let alone going to school. My neighbor was diagnosed with Chrons disease when she was in high school, she was in and out of the hospital for those 4 years. She missed so much school but had no way of being there because they did not have personal laptops . She missed out on so much school and had to transfer to Generic_School to be able to graduate on time. Some may believe that it is students responsibility to make it to class everyday without fail but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is not physically possible with most chronic illnesses. My cousin Generic_Name had Lyme disease her senior year of high school and missed 7 months of school due to complications with the disease and was unable to walk. She had to take her senior year over again because this technology was not available to her. It is impossible for people with chronic illnesses to make it to school everyday. When there is a health crisis some student may not be able to make it to school. In a world such as today there are so many things going on, such as the Corona virus. Many students will not be able to come to class because of existing health problems that weaken their immune system. There is a student named Generic_Name who has severe asthma and has been hesitant to come to school because if she were to contract the Corona virus it would be detrimental to her health as her lungs are already compromised. Some may believe that students should still have to go to school because there is no real harm in getting the virus but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that if someone has a preexisting medical condition that weaken their immune system the Corona virus will take a massive toll on them and coming to school will defiantly not be feasible then. For example anyone that has died from the corona virus so far has had preexisting medical conditions that have only been made worse with the introduction of the virus. Some students do not learn well in a classroom setting which in turn can make their grades plummet. Some student learn in different ways, some may be a visual learner and some may only learn things be doing it. When I was a freshman I was home schooled for the first part of the year but after failing all of my classes because there was no online work, it was only from a textbook, I went back to public school and excelled because most of the credits I was had to make up were online classes for English and history. I finished the online courses in a week when I had third and fourth quarter to finish them. Some may believe that students should be able to learn in any environment but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that not all students are the same. One of my siblings, Generic_Name, writes very colorful and neat notes because this is the way her mind will remember the information better. Another one of my siblings, Generic_Name, loves to read books, so if it is in a book she will remember it. Most students learn in different ways. In the past people have not been mindful of how other people learn and what other people are affected by, but I hope that in the future people will be accepting of their differences and work with them to make sure they are working to the best of their ability without being discriminated against. Students should be able to attend classes from home because of chronic illnesses, other health concerns, and some may learn better this way.","Dear Principle, Helping around the community is an important part of life. This task helps an individuals develop well-balanced human characteristics. The lessons taught in school are remembered from the rest of ones life and should impact a child's thoughts. Therefore, forcing students to help their community will provide thoughtful human-beings that will create a better universe. A well-balanced student creates thoughtful and loving leaders of the future. To have a variety of good characteristics produces kind people. Wouldn't the world be wonderful if everyone loved one another? These characteristics of thoughtfulness, kindness, patience, and so on led to no one being hurtful to anyone. If everyone could love, and be patient with each other the society would improve a great deal. Forcing the students of one school to get out in their community would create these human characteristics in the students. The world around us is in need of much help. The global warming is taking over, and the oceans are just not what they use to be. If everyone would just take a little time out to help, this universe would be impacted greatly. The world needs to be saved and we need to take the first steps. These students at this school can be the ones to start with a little push from the administration. Helping around the community changes the world and will produce a better atmosphere for our own children. Instead of slowly killing the universe around us, we should be stepping up and producing a better living society. Students can not quite grasp this idea all by themselves quite yet, therefore you need to step in. Thank You, Your student","Phones and Driving Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed. In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take. As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (""Distracted Driving"") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety. Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

","To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME, I am informed of your new policy change. I understand your views and though I understand academics are important, students need encouragement, recreation, and the opportunity to be well rounded and I find these things are in extra curricular activities and sports. Due to your consideration of this new policy it would be harsh on the children and director of the certain activity. By making this rule, I feel as if the students would be lacking the circumstances they need besides academics. Extra curricular activities enrich the mind, community, and body. Taking these things away from the children gives them nothing to look forward to after school, and keeps the school stress bundled up inside of them. Sports and clubs encourage students to relieve their stress, make friends, and become active in their community. So if a certain student really struggles, it would be discouraging and crush their self-esteem. Students that struggle have a right to enjoy activities, and maybe there would be an alternative to keep kids in sports and clubs, yet also maintain their grades. Possibly, you could organize a study group or extra help sessions from teachers after school so that they can participate in their activities but also keep up the grades. Since a C average is an average grade for most student, it would put down their confidence as if you were saying they are below the average, which could hurt the student's feelings very much. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak my mind and I thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion. I hope you thoughtfully consider my thoughts and opinions considering I myself, am a student of this school. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","We all plan to get cars when we get our licenses right? Wrong! The relationship between people and cars throughout the Earth is changing with fewer people buying cars and governments supporting the use of more eco-friendly methods of transportation. Two advantages of this change that I would like to point out is first the improvement in health, and second the fact green house gasses have gone down. These may seem like great ideas, but you may be asking yourself are such advantages possible? Begining with the lack of pollution, cars can produce Carbon dioxide which causes problems in the atmosphere. The gas traps sunlight creating greenhouse gasses which is responsible for global warming. This would cause problems for future generations with an increase in flooding and other factors that can destroy areas of living, not to mention the fact breathing in the fumes is bad for health. The scary part about the relationship between green house gasses and cars is that twelve percent of green house gasses caused by cars are in Europe. This may no frighten you, but when you take into account fifty percent of green house gasses lie in the U.S., you realize how seroius and frightenning the situation really is. Another benefit of the lack of car usage is the improvement of public health. It's known by many scientist and psycohlogist that an increase in stress is bad for health and can lower a person's life expentancy. In Vaubun Germany a mother's words about their Vaubun progam was ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" meanwhile in Bogota, Columbia a bussiness man said ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" during Bogota's car-free day program. Aside from the stress, people are getting far more fit as they walk or take a bike to their destionations, even in large cities like New York where you'll see people joining bike programs. Bicycle lanes are increasing greatley and in Bogota, 118 miles have already been built. In conclusion, I would like to point out that out our world is improving. The awareness of government and the people has lead into the creation of bicycle lanes, a lowering in the stress level of the people, and a decrease in green house gasses. This will in turn provide a better future for countless generations of people throughout the entire planet. It's as Bill Ford, executive of the Ford Motor company stated ""pedestria, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""    ","Often times, students are more apt to finishing the project when they get to choose their own project. Many believe that working hard will continue your strength of knowledge. That being said, I believe that if students had to complete an assignment over summer break, it should be student-designed. This would give them the opportunity to show their creativity, knowledge, and work ethic. Students who are able to choose their own assignment would be able to express their creativity how they believe it would fit. A portion of students could be excellent drawers, or just find enjoyment in drawing, and find that they want to do a project that they could express their drawing abilities. Others may find that they are more crafty and choose to do a sculpture of a significant scene in a book that they read. Students who are able to choose their own project can make it seem more interesting to them, given that they could make it how they want. Some may believe that having a teacher-designed project would be better, but not everyone would get to show their creative abilities. Creativity is an important factor that goes into making a project great. Second, students that get to pick their own project, would be able to show their strength of knowledge that they have learned throughout the years. This would be able to help them create something extraordinary and impress themselves and their teachers. Being able to express your knowledge can show someone how far you have come in your education and what you are still weak in. Finding your weaknesses is an important aspect and can help you grow as a person both inside and outside of school. Students that get to pick their own projects would be able to make it challenging for themselves. People may think that having a teacher-designed project would be more fair to everyone, but I believe that everyone's knowledge is different, so allowing them to design their projects would accompany their knowledge best. Thus, being able to express their knowledge is another important component in allowing students to pick their own project. Last, having students choose their own projects would help show their work ethic. By allowing them to choose their projects, it can aid them in allowing them to choose an assignment that they could finish in a couple of days, or challenge themselves and make a thorough project. Students, that I have seen, that get to pick their own projects are usually more ecstatic about making them above their expectations and have fun with it. This can also help them in managing their time wisely by being able to both finish the project and have fun during summer break. Some think that students should be given teacher-designed projects over the break so they will be more encouraged to finish them. I believe that if students are given a choice in what they want to do for their project, that it gives them more motivation to work on it and continue to make it better. Showing work ethic in an assignment is also an important aspect to allowing them to choose their own projects. Overall, I believe that allowing students to make their own project shows their creativity, knowledge, and work ethic. Not only do they get to make it all of the above things, but they also get to have fun with it. Sometimes not everyone enjoys the assigned projects that they are given by their teacher, so this allows them to get to expand the horizon and make it their own. Therefore, I believe that if students are given a project over summer break, it should be student-designed. ",,,,,,,
364,104,"Have you ever had to do a project over the summer for school. Well some schools have it as a requirement to do a project over the summer break. The project that is assigned by the school should be teacher designed. This is because when the students comeback to school there teachers design the projects that are given. Teachers know the specifc steps the students need to use to make sure they have the right information they need to get a good grade, and what information they are required to have on their projects. Also the teacher can design it around something the students do on a daily bases on summer break. First reason the teachers should design it because they design all the projects when the students comeback to school from summer break. I say this because the teachers are always making the plans, and creating the way the projects are done. This is shown when they give you a project they create those plans and requirements. It also shows where you can find the information about the subject that the project is on. The biggest thing about the teachers designing the project is that it is involved in what you are learning in the class that you have the project in. The second reason on why the teachers should design the projects is they know what information the students need to have on their projects. Also what specifc ways they can get the information without violating the rules of the projects. This is because students have access to all type information through the internet and other sources, but some sources are not correct. Websites on the internet are a prime example of getting false information, which could lead to getting a horrible grade on the project that is assigned. Also the teachers know the websites that are vaild because they go in and look through them carefully. Finally the teachers can design the project around something the students do everyday on summer break. This is because they know studnets on summer break are not going to do reading or writing a paper. So they just make it something easy like recored the weather for a two whole weeks. They also could make you track how long you sleep a day for a whole week. That is why teachers should design the summer break project. It is because they are going to have to make the projects when the sutudents comeback. ","Dear, TEACHER_NAME Do you believe that us students really have to do community service? I believe that student should do community service. I believe that student should do community service because of the environment. I believe that we should all do community service because i think that if we all work together we will have a better environment. I think that each and every one of us could participate in some community service to help. Maybe some of us could clean up beaches and maybe some of us could probably help elderly people or maybe some of us could even clean up the freeways if its needed. Now, i believe that some of the kids here at school may not want to be part part of this community service. I think that some kids may think that they have better things to do than community service, but what is better than trying to make our environment cleaner and nicer? If i was chosen to help out the environment i would gladly help, because I want our community and our environment to look nicer and be nicer. Now i also do believe that some kids are lazy and would rather be at home, watching T.V . But how do they expect our community and our environment to get cleaner if they're just sitting there not doing anything about it? Now what places do i think need some cleaning up? I think that maybe the beaches, the lakes the freeways and maybe even community centers like parks and older people homes. I think that if we maybe help clean up all of this we can have a better community and environment.","To the principal: I believe that the best cell phone policy is to allow students to have phone in school and allow them to use them during lunch periods and other free periods, so long as the phone are turned off during class time. Cell phones have become a near irreplaceable part of teens' lives today. The ability to be able to contact people at any place and moment in time is extremely important, to the point of being vital. For example, in case of an emergency, students would be able to contact their parents and the other people they would need to inform. Without this luxury- no, necessity- lives could be endangered. Moreover, students would be happier during school because they would be allowed to use their cell phones- at the right time, of course. Thus, students would have a more positive attitude during class, would work harder, and obtain better grades. Now, i understand why cell phones are generally not accepted in classrooms. cell phones can be distracting in class; you can talk, text message, and IM friends; you can play games or use the internet. With all of the things you can do with that one machine, it's no wonder that cell phones are deemed a distraction in classrooms. However, if cell phones were permitted to be used during lunch periods and other free periods, I assure you that students' cell phones would not be a distraction during class time any longer. If cell phones were allowed to be used in class, the temptation to use them in class would no longer exist. The reason for that is people always want what they can't have. In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain says that in order to make something desirable to someone, you must make it difficult to obtain. Since it would not be difficult to use cell phones, there would not be a need to have them banned in class- and banning cell phones in class would cause cell phone usage to go up. I hope that you consider changing the school's cell phone policy to be more lenient about cell phone usage, which would in turn give the school a more student-friendly environment.","The students may have trouble with work at home so their grades might be a little low, but if we had more time to work on it in class and we had it explained to us clearly we might understand it more. I think the school policy should not be changed to we have to have a B grade average to play sports most kids have trouble once in a while, but we just need more help then we get now. Students just need to be passing to play sports and have fun another way to get kids to work better, and harder is to reward them with a game or a treat. If kids don't get to play sports or games they might not work even hard enough to get a c' s it would be d' s and f' s if the students get privileges they will work harder. What the school could do is set up events for all the students to do for a limited amount of time a day like 30 minuets before lunch. The teachers can just take more time on each lesson to make sure every one knows what to do. Events can be used as an activity and a free time thing to do, but if students decide to play sports Instead of have the activity they can get a few friends and go play the sport of their choosing. It will be good to use to get students attention and to buckle down in school, and do their work so they can get rewarded. If they have work for a class they can go into their teachers class to get their work done and then they should be able to go play if they did not get in trouble all week. every student deserves one chance to improve on there grades and to stay out of trouble. even the good kids mess up sometimes so all the students need to get a second chance.","Phones & Driving Isn't driving a vehicle without cellular devices distracting and stressful enough?? I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference. The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others. Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations. In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!             ",""" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a list of facts, reasons, and statements about Venus. The author believes that exploring Venus would be a good idea. He talks about how "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". That would be the closest thing to Earth in our solar sytem that we may be able to explore. Now the challenges of exploring Venus are that there is a constant temperature of around 800 degrees Fahrenheit always on the surface of the planet. There are clouds covering Venus that have high amount of sulfuric acid in them, the planets surface is covered in 97 percent carbon dioxide. If we want to explore this planet we're going to need to find materials that can withstand those horrible conditions. The last recorded spacecraft on Venus only lasted 3 hours. Despite the dangers that come with all of this planet, if we could find a way to explore this planet safely and get gas and rock samples that could tell us a lot about this planets past and if it was similiar to Earth. The technology that we need to explore this planet with we are still yet to find a perfect solution to, we are chipping away at it slowly and finding new ideas that could get us there eventually. This new material that is made out of silicon carbide has been tested in the chamber and has lasted three weeks in conditions like Venus's, That is just getting one step closer to something that could last a long time on the surface of that planet. The harsh temperatures and gases are something that a human can survive through but we need our technology to get through it too. We've used electronic computers in space travel since they would have been able to be used in spacecrafts. The idea is to use a older device that runs off of gears and bearings that can with stand the elements because electronic computers are so delicate they wouldn't last very long in those enviroments. If we are able to find materials that can last long enough to try and get samples that would be our best bet, our first idea is to stay at around 30 miles above the surface of the planet. Temperatures would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but we have materials that can withstand those temps. Since the surface of Venus is so cloudy our photograpy methods won't work to really see the surface of that planet. We need to find all the materials and new technology before trying to do something that we havent been able to do successfully yet. I think that looking at everything we want to accomplish with Venus as a many many steps so we can accomplish it succesfully and be prepared for anything that were to come at us in a mission. I do believe that with the right amount of thought, time, innovation, and energy put into this that it could be something that would be accomplishable. Having the technology to be able to land on Venus and take gas, rock, and sediment samples we can learn a lot about the planets past and maybe find something new. I do not believe that this idea is farfetched i believe that it is something accomplishable.      ","Cars have helped people over the years, but has it helped the enviorment or your heath. When driving a car, the car releases gases that can effect the air around us. There are advantages of limiting the use of cars, like a heathier enviroment and a heathier body. One advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier enviroment. When you are driving a car the gas in the car, is let out into the air. The gas that gose in the air can effect the air and plants around us, as it can turn to toxic. As the source Elisabeth Rosenthal explains, 50 percent of the greenhouse gases are caused by car-intensive areas in the United States. The gas from are cars are not just effecting are air, there effecting are greenhouse to. The source Robert Duffer tells us, how paris banded using cars after days of near-record pollution to clear the air. After days of no cars the air was clear again. As you can tell, limmiting car uses will help the enviroment alot. Forthermore, Another advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier body. Instead of just siting in a car you can ride a bike,walk or roller skate. Also all those gases from the car wont be going in your body, effecting your insides. As the source Andrew Selsky explains, in Colombia on free car day the people hicked,skated and bicked to get where they need to go, instead of using a car. Without a car to take you places you will get exercie, which will give you power and engery for your body. A normal person should also exercise for 30 mintes a day. Also as Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us without a car you have less stress and are able to relax more. Cars can cause people alot of stress, and a alot of stress is not good for your body. Limiting the use of cars has a great effect on your heath. Conslusion, Limiting the use of cars will have the advantages of a heathier enviroment and a heathier body. The enviroment and your body is a big thing in your life, so you would want to do whatever possible to keep it heathy. So instead of talking the car try to walk or ride a bike next time.    ",,,,,,,
364,825,"The saying ""Knowledge is power"" didn't come about for no reason. It came about because being educated is important, especially in today's day and age. This is why school is mandatory, and we only get a small break over summer. But even over break we need to learn in order to keep our minds strong. To ensure we do so, some schools assign summer projects. Summer projects should be student-desgined because it gives students a break from strict rules and guidelines, it allows them to express themselves and learn in a way that's best for them, and it allows them to decide what fits best in their schedule. Allowing students to design their own projects would give them a break from strict rules and guidelines. Students go to school for almost ten months out of the year and five days of the week. During that time, majority of assignments and projects are teacher-designed. Students hardly ever have a say in how they do assignments, they're just told what to do throughout the year and have to do it, again and again until break. Being able to choose something you like and do it in a way you want for once would be such a relief. And not to mention, it is summer. Summer is supposed to be a break from school, when students can relax. Giving them a basic, strict, school project over summer defeats the purpose, and they are probably less likely to do it, which is why they should be able to design their projects themselves. Furthermore, projects tend to be timely and require a good amount of work and information from a student. If students are able to express themselves in their own way while doing so, it could motivate them to actually complete the project, and it would give them a chance to show their teachers their best work. While students should always complete their schoolwork, that's not reality. If students are able to do an assignment in their own way, it gives them a chance to find and do something that interests them and that they could possibly enjoy, which makes it more likely for them to do it. After all, the goal is to make sure they learn, which is only going to happen if they do the work, and doing so in their own way encourages that. Furthermore, students are more likely to put in effort if they're doing something that they are genuinely interested in doing, rather than if they were not. When they actually put in the effort, it will show in their work. This not only shows their teacher their best work, but it shows they learned something, and the student will benefit from the knowledge and the high grade they will earn. In addition, allowing students to design their own projects lets them decide what fits best in their schedule. Believe it or not, students have lives too. While of course this doesn't apply to all students, we can't just completely disregard the lives of the ones who it does apply to. Over summer, some students work, some travel, some see family, and so on. Let's say a teacher were to design the project, and a student had something come up, or it just didn't fit well into their schedule. The project would not be done to the best of their ability or may not be done at all. Then, the student will be the one who pays for it. Allowing students to design their own projects eliminates all of these issues. Now, on the other hand, some may say teachers should design the project. They may say teachers are experienced and know what's best for students. While this may be true for some, not all students are the same. Some may also say teachers will give us a challenge and make sure we learn, while a student will just find the easiest route and go on it. This may also be true, students challenged throughout the whole school year, they don't necessarily need another one over their summer break. Additionally, if a student does just choose the easy route, they will be the ones paying for it in the end. Regardless of these points, students would benefit more from designing their own projects, and the overall point of the project is to benefit the student. In conclusion, schools that assign summer projects should let students design them. Allowing students to design their own projects it gives them a break from strict rules and guidelines they follow all year long. It also allows students to express themselves and learn in a way that's best for them, and it allows them to decide what fits best in their schedule. These facors will encourage students to complete the summer project which directly contributes to the teachers' overall goal, which is assuring students continue to learn over their break.","Dear Mr Principal, I am writing you this letter regarding your decision on making it mandatory for students to perform community service. I myself think that it is sort of a waste of time, depends on what you are going to be doing. If it is something fun then I'll agree on making it mandatory if i have the time, if not then it is a waste of time. Maybe other students don't think it is but i do because i have many things to do when I get home from school or when i am on break. If u were to make it mandatory then maybe students might agree if you were too make then do a couple of hours. I don't think that would really bother then that much, but lets say you were to over exaggerate and make then do tons of community service than i would know there reason to be furious. Well bottom of the line is that students should be required to do community service, but to cut them some slack u should mandate them to a whole lot of community service so they wont end up furious. Anyways i hope this letter will aid you with the decision on what you should do. Farwell! Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear, Prinicipal I think that you should allow students to bring cell phones to school and let use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. If you allow us to use our cell phones during lunch periods and free time it would keep us from getting into trouble for having them during school. Also parents would not have to come to school to just pick up our cell phones. Now days kids are getting in trouble mainly because of their cell phone going off during class or it falls out of their pocket. But why are we not aloud to have cell phones? Another good reason for letting use our cell phones is because some students have extra ciricail activities after school and what if the child needs to remind there parents to pick them up after school. What if a student forgets their homework at home and the school want let them call their parents so they can bring the homework to the child so he/she don't get a bad grade for their homework assignment. So really think about it, students should be able to use their cell phone during lunch periods and other free times the student may have. T Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",I believe that this is a good policy that you must have at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities. I think this is a good policy because for some people high school is difficult enough when your not busy and all those programs can distract you from doing good in school. Sports can be distracting because instead of studying for a test you might have to go to practice or go to a game. Another reason why this is a good policy is because in sports you don't always make it on a college team or a pro team and then you have to get a regular job. If you didn't get good grades in high school then you it's harder for you to find a job in this job market. Companies would much rather hire a person that got a B or A average than a person that got a C or D average who played sports in high school. That's just how it works just because it's much more of a struggle to find a job now than in the twentieth century. Also this is a good idea because it could set an example for some younger athletes that want to continue to play sports that they have to keep their grades up in order to play. If they didn't decide to use this policy then some people might not even try to get good grades and just worry about sports. There's one thing bad about the policy though. I believe that they should wait a while before they pass this policy to give some students sometime to learn some healthier studying methods. If they pass it in the middle of the school year most students will not have enough time to make the change. Overall i think that this policy is good and won't be surprised if it does get passed considering how so many politicians are raising issues of how the nation's kids are learning            ,"Cell phones have become a important item in today's society. There have been people who use this item excessively, especially while they drive. Driving while using cell phones can make the driver less focused, not only on the road but to your surroundings. Not paying full attention can also slow down your reaction time. When it comes to cell phones and driving I support the use of them with moderation (use when parked). Cell phones can benefit the driver in many ways. They can be used as a gps. It helps people who are driving alone and can't get someone else to use a paper map. A phone can be a source of entertainment too. For those who enjoy songs or podcast that are not normally on the radio. Most drivers can be distracted by cell phones. One example is if their phone falls out of the vehicle mount. This action will tempt them to pick it up causing their attention to be taken off of the road which can lead to a car crash. Another would be holding a conversation with someone one the phone. Finally sending or reading a text message. Even though cell phones can provide a driver with options on their experience while riding. Being able to listen to different types and styles of music. Also making sure you are going to the proper destination. It should not be used to the point where it can take you attention off the rode.         ","My opinion is that we should study venus. Yes, it might be dangerous but if you would want to find out more about venus then that's the option. ""Researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" We wouldn't be able to see it far away. We would need to see it close up so we would be able to study and explore it. Venus has something we want to learn about, not specifically that but about it. It has so many things that we want to see and study. ""Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us."" Venus is the hottest even if it's not the closest to the sun. ""Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Studying venus would be much better. We would know more about venus and it is. We would know what it has and what don't it have. ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" Some of venus features are unknown but some are analogous to those on earth. ""NASA's possible solution to the hositle conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" ""Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky."" Venus is the second planet from our sun. We are curious what venus has and study it. It has so many things that earth dosen't. It's a whole different planet. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus."" It might be dangerous but one day we will get to go to venus. NASA is trying there hardest to get a person to venus but we need more materials and money for that. Almost 3 decades we haven't went to venus. It's a challenge to study and get back. NASA will complete this challenge. ","Many cause of limited car usage tends to have less people on the streets. Near the French and Swiss borders ; streets and driveways and home garages were not allowed for free parking. It forced people to park in places where it was usually crowded. Most people did not like the parking rules. They either rode their bikes or walked back and forth to get to their destination. Later after that, many people were very upset with the parking rules, that alot of them decided to sell their car so they could park wherever and that had opened spaces for multiple cars to transpass the roads at the same time. Same thing in Bogota, Columbia but the problem they had, was the pollution in the air. Columbians rode on buses with other people because the believed it was safer than being in a car and getting in an accident. Paris had the same problem, except they were fined to be driving. About 4,000 drivers were fined and others cars were to be impounded for arguing about being fined. I think the better way for the car problems, is to have all people discuss the problems and explain what is best for other people. The solution near French and Swiss border is to let people park wherever they like and Columbia to clean up their pollution so they can live through fresh and safer enviroment.                    ",,,,,,,
364,901,"A project over the summer is a great idea for students to continue to learn. On the other hand, allowing teachers to decide on what students should create isn't the best idea. In the summertime, students love to have fun, create new things, and discover. Leaving the project up to them could challenge their creativity and work ethic. It's not only fun for students, but fun for teachers to see what the students bring back. During my fifth grade science fair, we were allowed to conduct any experiment we wanted. I decided to blow bubbles and see which gum brand made the biggest bubble. This was fun to do because it was what I thought that made it a successful project. In my opinion, I became proud of myself for taking initiative for completing the assignment on my own. In addition, when it was time to present my own work I didn't have any problems. I knew what I was talking about and it gave me confidence in front of the class. Sharing all the information I was articulate and when answering questions I was assertive. My teacher was surprised with the quality of my lab and she knew I had put lots of time and effort into this. Nevertheless, In a teachers perspective of giving a controlled project to students is necessary. They don't always see where things could go wrong. A student could be confused about instructions and do the project completely wrong. Some might feel like it's boring and a waste of time. Giving the student the freedom to illustrate and present their own idea is the most creative way to learn. Therefore, students designing their own project ideas surpass teachers. Making it fun to learn instead of what might feel like a burden. Teachers determine effort and creativity for the most part. It's up to students to demonstrate correctly. Could you do it on your own? ","Dear Principal I think we should help with community service, because it makes our town a better place. People could help by recycling, cleaning up our lake or picking up the trash on the sides of the roads and at the parks. people should recycle because it gets rid of all the plastic waste that could harm the animals in their ecosystem that they survive in, and it just makes the world a better place in general. cleaning up our lake is another good way to help our community factories should not put waste products in the fresh water that we use in our every day lives it can harm the animals and most importantly us, by getting rid of all the trash think of how much more prettier the lake would be no one wants to go see a trashy lake and then later get a drink of water and think wait this may of had tons of trash in it gross. Getting rid of trash in the parks and roads are also good for the town it makes us look like a town who cares about what they look like. there should be schedules saying who cleans where, when, and how long so its not just one person doing all the work and every on taking the credit , and that would eliminate arguments over who cleaned more. i would recommend community service for our school.","Dear principal, I think that kids should only be able to use there cell-phone if there is an emergency or before school they can use it or after school that's the only time kids should be able to use their phone. If they do take it into school they should keep it in there locker or off in there pockets if they bring it into class. I think this is a great idea because kids could just pull it out of there pocket and start using it when the teacher is not looking or paying attention. For example kids in my school play with there phones when the teacher is not paying attention or looking then they laugh about what's on there phone so then the teacher has to stop teaching and r remove the phone from the kids and then the teacher keeps it till the end of the day. Then the kids mom or dad has to come to school to get it from the teacher. In my school if you get caught with a phone the principal takes it and calls your parents to come to school and get the phone from the office. If my mom had to come and get my phone she would take it home and put it somewhere i couldn't find it then I would be grounded for a month. Then when I would get it back I would have to put in my locker so i wouldn't get it taken away again. Just like in the video I watched before I had to do this writing piece some kid was using his phone when the teacher wasn't looking and kids open a book and then use there phone inside the book and text somebody so the teacher doesn't know what they are doing. From, STUDENT_NAME      ","Sports have been a big part of school for as long as we all know of. Do you believe it's a good policy to remove those with failing grades off of their sport's team? Having to change a policy a such as removing students with below a B grade average is a important thing to do especially if your player is not doing so great education wise. It can help them pick up their grades. It is also a good consequence to show that without good grades, you are not allowed to play. The policy of removing those with low grade average off their sports team is a good idea, because it helps your student stay on track and pick up their grades. Being excused from a sport event due to grades, can show the student that he or she needs to spend less time practicing with the team and more time getting better grades. I, being a sports player, know that without grades, I cannot play a game or attend practice. This gives you time to make up missing assignments, get extra credit, get a better grade, and continue doing that sport you like to do. This policy is also good because you need to give consequences to those who do not do well in school. Yes, getting in trouble with coach is bad, but school is important. Without a great education, the chances of becoming a professional athlete become very slim. You need grades, and good practice to make you a great player and a great student. Having good grades, reminds me that I can create a better future, and not worry about being excused from my team. Many of you may agree with my opinion about this policy, but I know some of you may have some concerns. Maybe one of these concerns is that your student won't proceed with getting good grades. Well the solution to that is simple, no grades, no play. I understand, as a athlete myself, having to be excused due to grades is bad and can get me a little upset. But I know, without my grades, I won't be allowed back on the team. So as you can see having a policy such as this one is good for the school, and your students. It helps them get back on track. It is also good consequence for those that don't get good grades. Just remember, being strict isn't all that bad because","Do I think drivers should be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Although this topic is an on-going debate I do not believe that drivers should be able to use their cellular devices to a certain extent whie driving. What I mean by this statement is that drivers should be able to use their phones if a gps is needed, however only with a phone holder in the car. Also, people should be able to make urgent calls here is three reasons why i think people shouldnt be able to use their cellphones because you can cause traffic collision. Also, it puts not only the driver in danger but other drivers also. Its also ilegal to be on the phone while your driving. The government made a new law the hands free law. The hands free law is a new law in the united states the hand free law is all drivers operating a moving vehicle on any highway of the state are prohibited from holding an electronic device while driving. Also, NO TEXTED WHILE DRIVING! Another one is no watching videos, movies and etc while driving. If you break a law their are always fines that you would have to pay so if its your first time breaking the hands-free law the fine is $50.00 the second time you break this law the fine will be $100.00. You are not allowed to us your cell phone while driving but you can use your phone if you stop the car not at a stop sign but like if your stop to park somewhere then you can get on your cellphone. I feel like if you need to used your cellphone like for an emergency you should go to the nearest parking lot and then do what you got to do.       ","The author claim is that exploring venus is worth pursuing even tho its every dangerous. The author suggests that studying venus is a great chance to learn and find new things and supports alot of theses claims by giveing some great support on why its a good idea. The author starts by explaning that venus is referrd to as Earh's twin in maney cases cause its the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size. Venus also nickednamed the ""Evening Star"" is one of the planets closest to the Earth in distance as also Mars is in that distance aswell. All three planets are around and orbit the sun at different speeds says the author in paragraph 2.""Often referred to as Earth's twin Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in the distnace too"". ""Earth,Venus,Mars,our planetary negihbor,orbit the sun at different speeds"". The author starts giving his part on why we should study and travel venus by saying its the planet the may have once been the most Earth like planet in the solar system long ago and was probbley covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like how earth is today. Venus still has some known features that still resemble Earth today like the planet haveing a rocky sediment and includs things such as valleys,moutains,craters. Altho Venus does seem nice its very dangerous to travel there and is not safe for humans at the moment. Scientest have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus but no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Venus also has a thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that sarounds Venus. The even more challeging thing is the clouds that are highly corrosive of sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the fact that the planets surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit makeing these far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth as said by the author in paragraph 3""a thick amtosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dixiode blankets Venus"".""Even more challeing are the clouds of highely corrosive sulfuric acid in venu,s atomsphere"". Traveling to venus seems too dangerous but the author gives some ideas on how we can possably make traveling to Venus safer. One of these ideas come from The National Aeronautics and Space Adinistration also known as (NASA).This idea is for sending humans to study Venus NASA,s soluiton to the harsh Venus conditions of its surface is to make a blimp like vehicle that would hover 30 or so miles above the planet. This would allow scientists to avoid the unfirendly ground conditions of Venus and with the only minor problem being the air would still be a little hot at 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air pressure being close to Earth at sea level. This is one of the maney ideas on how to vist the planet Venus and its values says the author.""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insigt to be gaind on the planet itself,but also beacause human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".","Dont get me wrong cars are a good thing for but we do not need them to live. We use them to get around but look at how much money it costs us in gas and just to bye the car. Plus it is destroying are ecosystem at a alarmingly high rate.

So ya we use cars to get around but we dont need them. take a look at this town called Vauban, in Germany ""near the Swiss and French border"". the streets of ""Vauban are completely ""car free"""". so if they can do it why cant we.

Ok London did a week without cars because of smog but with all the pollution from car emissions that they did not use that week was a lot when u facter in that they had as crapy air as Beijing, China,and they only got rid of half there cars for they week. Imagine how mutch cleaner are air would be if we got rid of all are cars for just a week. By then we would be used to it so even bring the cars back that right there would keep making are air clean.

876,104,"Imagine if you had to do an extracurricular activity at school with no say otherwise. Extracurricular activities are meant for a fun, optional, learning experience. Most schools offer activities for student interests. Students like the option of extracurricular activities because they can participate in their interests if they want to but it isn't mandatory like most other things in school. I disagree that students should be forced to do extracurricular activities because students should have the choice of what they want to do, most students are busy with other things outside of school, and students may not be interested in what their school offers. Students shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because they should have the choice of what they want to do. Schools offer activities so students can participate in things they want do, not have to do. Being forced to participate in things a student doesn't want to do can stress them out. Most things in school are mandatory so students like not feeling the pressure of being forced to do something. Making students participate in extracurricular activities can have benefits too. It would make them go out and do something and help them learn new skills. In the end multiple downsides outweighs a few benefits. While there may be benefits to forcing students to go and do something, in the end they should have their own choice of what they want to do or not do. Another reason why students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities is because most students are already busy with other things outside of school. Forcing more upon them would stress them out and make them dislike school. Students already dread each night they go home because of all their homework so making them have even more to do will over stress them leading to depression and lack of effort. While it is good to challenge students to help them find their full potential, overworking them can lead to problems with their health and efforts during school. Extracurricular activities are supposed to make learning fun and help students learn new skills, not make them dread every day of school. Overworking students when they are already busy leads to anxiety and stress which is why extracurricular activities shouldn't be mandatory. The last reason why schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities is because some students may not be interested in what their school offers. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students discover what their interests are, not force them to do things they don't care for. Extracurricular activities are supposed to help students know what they might be interested in doing in the future. If a student doesn't have interest in any of their schools options, they shouldn't be forced to do them. Some students may only have interests in things they can't do at their school. While some students might have interests that their school offers, not everyone does making it unfair for everyone to have to do an activity. If schools make students do things they don't want to, they will start questioning if their schools cares about their opinion or interests. In the end, students should have the choice of whether or not they want to do extracurricular activities since some are busy with other things and others aren't interested in what is offered. Overall, I have proved why I think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. Between being forced to do extracurricular activities and having a choice, having a choice is definitely the right answer. I chose that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities because they should be able to make their own choices, even if it isn't always the best answer.","Talking to three people will help anybody with something they cant decide on. If somebody says one thing and then you say another. The only solution is to only get help from one other person. So that you could have three including yourself. Their is no reason to have only ask one person something because when anyone ask three people something, its bound to have a answer because its three people and there is an odd number of people. Studies have shown, when anybody ask more than one person a for advice then it gets solved quickly. Whenever there is two people and they gives you advice that you disagree with. All everyone should do is just ask one more person for advice. After that then you will finally know just side with the person that likes your idea. The next time you you want advice from one person remember this. One person is greater than two. If anyone were to ask a group of three. With you making four, there will most likely be a tie. Lets say you pick blue and one other person goes with you, that remains two more and they like orange. that means there is a tie. So basically what i'm am saying is that. When a group of people have a even number there is a impossible chance of solving witch person to go with for advice. Okay when you talk to one person then it could be helpful to take advice from them. But its a better idea to ask two because now there is another side to just that one earlier. If your friend were to get in a fight. And you were right there. The principle isn't just going to take you side. They will see if the other kid could tell there side, so that they will have more than one side of the story. The next time you ever take advice from one person remember to just ask one more.","Join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can experience different adventures from all around the world.

Joining this program is very helpful to the citizens/people living in these countries because of World War II. Although, joining this program can sometimes be very dangerous. From high waves and huge thunderstorms, to slipping overboard and getting very wet and ice-cold.

This system enables computers to identify six of the human emotions. This technology should be used to read the emotional expresiions of students in a classroom, because it is a very valuable technology. Firstly, we should have this technology because it would help explain how people would be feeling on a certain subject, lifestyle or in everyday life. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" Since Dr. Eckman has programmed these emotions we can better understand how someone is feeling without having to ask him; each emotion inflicts a facial muscle movement which is recognised and is catagorized as an emotion. In addiotion, we should have these identifiers because it could help students learn better. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software could help someone who is easily distracted. This technology could find a way to help with this person, and the coding system could produce a lesson that this person can listen to and understand it because it was made for them. Also, the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers and staff. Some students do not show what they are feeling. If this technology can figure out facial expressions then the teachers will know who is having a bad day, the teacher could then talk to this person privately and see how they are doing. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotuions, but also may even help produce them."" Since studies show that if a student smiles they could have a better day. The teacher could recognise that someone is feeeling down so they could say a funny joke and sprout an emotion into a particualr student. In the final analysis, we should have the Facial Action Coding System in school because it will help students feel better and learn better. If a student does not want to go to school then they probably do not want to learn either. If this system can make someone's day then students would want to come to school, and teachers would then have students who want to learn. ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great article and the technology that is included in the article may be the next big thing. The first step for the coding system is to use the technology to read the emotional expression of student in classrooms. This technology can help a student throughout their school work. It can also help the teachers to teach more passionatly to students who want to learn and are not forced to come to school, but come voluntarily.","Car's. Relyed on by many people. Used to go anywhere and everywhere. They are comfortable and cool to look at, but are they really as great as everyone think's they are? They pollute, they cause accident's, they destroy the enviornment and they cost a lot of money and sometime's it's more then people have. Yes, car's make everything easier for you but what happen's when there is a bad traffiv day and you are already late to work. Sometime's car's arent alway's a great thing. Gas. The first thing I think of when I hear about car's. They put so many toxin's in to the air that can kill everything around them. In the article it talk's about Paris banning car driving due to the fact that the smog or gas coming fromm the car's was becoming unbareable. Congestion was down 60% due to the fact that the smog had intensified. Beijing, China happen's to be the one of the most polluted citie's in the world due to car's. The fuel in car's is pushed out the exhaust pipe when the car is driving which then pollute's the air which make's it hard for thing's that need air such as the surrounding animal's, plant's and human's such as our self's. Another thing that cause's problem's with car's is the fact that traffic jam's and accident's that are just waiting to happen at any moment. Someone who doesn't know how to drive very well hit's someone else and it cause's an accident leaving people hurt. Not to mention the stress and the road rage that driving put's on people. Going outside and walking to work or going to the park with out all the problem's of being stuck in a car and enjoying the fresh air is a great way to start any day. On the day that Bogota, Colombia decided to have a car-free day people had hiked, biked,skated,and walked. These are thing's that I'm sure people wouldn't have done if they were still allowed to still drive their car. How would car's drive if they didn't have the road's that we build? How do the road's get there? They get put down where there used to be tree's and land. People destroy and take apart the earth and the put down road's and building's. What do people plan to do when they have taken down all the tree's and used all the space that the earth has to offer? There will be nothing left. Car's are great and all, I understand that they are fast and they make life simplier but people are getting lazy and they are starting to not care about their surrounding's and it's sad. Car's are not cheap. They take time and money. When a car has a problem or break's down you have to pay to get it fixed. You have to pay to put gas in your car and depending on how much gas your car need's, it can put a hole in your wallet. Car's. We use them, rely on them to take us where we want to go, use them for entertainment such as Nascar and Monster Truck's. One day all the car's will be gone and then what will the world do.    ","What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections  of the President  by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president  by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote. Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by elecoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to  vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote  it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,''faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what  could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter .Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win .When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good .You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes  out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe. In the other hand,voting by Electoral College  benefited us .Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. Accordind to the last article ""In [2012's ] election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney....'' That means their votes helped Obama win. Also' the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done. To summarise my reasonnings  Electoral College votes should be change to election by  popular vote  for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier .Without happy people the country would be upside down. Put this question in your  mind,what would you do if you were running for president  ,and they told you Electoral College would be voting?    ","Summers in High school are some of the best times in a persons life. The summer gives students the time to relax and unwind from all the hard work they put into the previous school year. Some schools over the summer want their students to continue their learning by giving them a project. Summer projects should be designed by the students because it gives the students a sense of motivation, students can develop social and creativity skills, and a students extracurricular activities wont be affected. Firstly, motivation will be developed if students designed their own summer projects. Its proven that most students need motivation in order to do their work. By having students design their own projects they will have the motivation to finish, due to it putting forth their own interests onto the project instead of teachers interests. In addition, it can also explore a students interest in a subject and that can expand their mind in learning and critical thinking. For example, a problem with teachers designing these projects is that students don't care about the material and don't retain the information. This can effect the students grades and lead to a downturn and possibly effect their future grades. A student designed project will help a student retain information better because its on their level of understanding and would create more fun for the student while they are learning the material. Furthermore, during the school year when teachers give projects students rarely turn them in on time. If projects were student designed then students will develop the motivation needed to finish because it is their creative interests rather than their teachers given guidelines. Secondly, creativity and social skills can be developed if summer projects were student designed. Student projects developed by teachers are normally in a certain subject or area and every student has to follow the given criteria. This can then effect how students communicate and problem solve in school. Creativity is lacking in these students not just because of technology but because the teachers design everything for them. Summer projects should be a time for students to be able to put their creativity to the test. Projects designed by students will take a lot of thinking and they will try many different design to create something which will increase their creativity due to them not following restricted guidelines given by the teacher. Another thing lacking is the social skills a student develops. For example if a history teacher gives students a history project assignment about the Civil War everyone in that class has to do the same thing and no one really talks to each other about it. If students designed the summer projects it enables students to socialize with each other and discuss the different topics that interest them creating a more social environment rather then having a certain view point handed to them. Lastly, a students extracurricular activities won't be affected if summer projects were student designed. During the summer, families normally take vacations and some students are able to work and even get internships to get experience in different job fields. These students dont have much time on their hands to be able to finish a complicated project. A student going on vacation to Greece with their family doesn't want to stay inside and waste their time doing a complicated project designed by a teacher that they might not even understand. A student designed project can help create a better understanding for the student and they can finish is quicker without it interfering with their family time. In addition, Students with jobs and internships might not have the time to be able to complete a project. These students have schedules and standards they have to follow in order for them to keep their position at their workplace. A complicated project will either interfere with their job and effect their employment or be left unfinished and when the school year comes around their grade will take suffer. But, if the student designed the project then one could actually finish it and enjoy it rather than dread it and not being able to finish it due to their other work commitments. Some may argue that since the teachers know the material they should design the summer projects. If teachers design it the project will then produce more accurate information for the students knowledge and help them get a good start in the upcoming school year. Though that's a valid reason, The teachers arent the ones who are actually doing the project and learning the new information given. The project might appeal to teachers interests but that won't help the students retain the information if its not something they enjoy or they find the criteria difficult. Whereas a student designed project will help the student because most of them have the same level of understanding the material and students can give each other tricks into memorizing and learning the information. Summer projects shouldn't be designed by teachers because that can effect a students motivation toward the project, it can interfere with a students summer activities, and social and creativity skills won't be developed. The summer shouldn't be a time of stress for students as they have just gone through plenty of it. By developing a system of having students designing the summer project rather than the teachers, can create more possibilities for a students mind and the generations after it.   ",,,,,,,
876,825,"Principal makes kids do extracurricular activities. I sorry but I'm going to disagree on this one because, parents work and most of the activities have after school stuff so parents that don't get off in time can not pick them up from it. Plus students are given home work to do,so if they do there sports and things how are they going to do homework. my third reason is that sports and activities sometimes cost money to get into,like the club would want you to pay dues. Next is the activities when kids do them it takes there learning time away. Plus the in sports can be hard to get into. And sometimes you have to have certain requirements to play ,and some people can't make those requirements. But theres also a due that people have to pay so thats why some parents don't let there kids play sports. Finally the conclusion is that the principal should not make kids do sports or join a club ,because it is a hard time for the parents and the kids to do a sport and worry about a different thing. So some school should not make a students do something that they don't want to do. And the last thing I want to say is that you should never force a student to do something that they don't want to do.","When in the need of advice,would you ask others what they would do in that situation? Well,when asking others what they would do,they give you an idea of how different people would handle different situations. For example,if you were an 8th grader going to High School,you would most likely want some advice from a person who has had or if they were to experience what your going through. Everyone's different,which means everyone has different ideas and opinions. So,the next time you find yourself in a situation where you need advice,make to sure to: Figure out what YOU would do Ask others what THEY would do Compare yout ideas and opinions with theirs Make new ideas and create new solutions for your problems. Hopefully,with these simple steps,you'll seek better advice and opinions. The Right People If you have found yourself in a situation where you would want some advice,finding the right people to ask is very important. To find the right people to ask for advice,you should: If the person has gotten into a lot of trouble for his dicisions,it's not really a great idea asking him/her. Make sure the person is serious and not a joker. Finding the right people to ask is very important,and with these reasons you'll find the right people to ask for advice.                                                                             ","Luke had just graduated college and his friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to Europe with him. Luke said yes because it was an opportunity of a lifetime and he could not pass it up. Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said, ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy he got to see Europe, China and he got to see the Acropolis in Greece."" He got to see so many great sites. Luke toured an excaveted castle in crete and he marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Luke had to travel a lot. But, even though it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to China. On the long journey Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowboys played lots of games. Some of the games they played was baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals lived. They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time. Luke said that ""being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure."" For Luke it opened up the world to him. Luke had a lot of fun seeing different sites, meeting new people, playing fun games and caring for people in a different, and better way.

In the second story and on the thirteenth paragraph it states that presidents mainly get picked from bigger states. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states"". This ensures that the small states, like Ohio and Rhode Island, have no chance in winning. Popular vote should rule which candidate gets chosen. In the second story on the first paragraph it explains how a cadidate won the popular votes, didn't win the presidency. ""...According to a Gallup poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

In the second story on the third paragraph it says that the election is a few voters away from catastrophe. ""And if an electoral tie seems unlucky, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" This could never happen if the popular vote was used to decide who to elect for president.                    ","A journalist in The New Yorker once said, ""Want what we want to want."" Our education system consists of the constant absorption of knowledge. The student uses the knowledge to complete teacher-designed assignments in exchange for a grade. In reality, a person uses their knowledge to navigate his or her life. It is important that the students are constantly acquiring new knowledge from learning institutions. However, as they have the right to obtain an education, they also have the right to select the knowledge they had acquire. Students are encouraged to use their imagination to find pathways catered to their futures. However, some teacher-designed assignments limit the student's imagination. Furthermore, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The schools have to decide whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Based of my prior knowledge, summer projects should be student-designed because it increases students' leadership skills, critical thinking skills, and development. Student-designed assignments allows for the students to take leadership in their pathways. In the beginning of the education, students are introduced to different extracurricular courses. These children are encouraged to explore their options as they continue their education and go into secondary school. They are given more freedom to choose their classes as they are expected to find a path that works best for them. Similar to the student's freedom to choose a path, this freedom should also be implemented on summer projects. Students should design their summer projects as it will enable them to explore their options. The students can take initiative in catering the projects toward their future careers; thus, making the projects more helpful towards them. In addition, these projects allow for students to act as the teacher, increasing their leadership skills. Students are able to view a teacher's perspective as they design their own projects. They are able to think in a global perspective and create an assignment that is reliable for others. As a teacher, they are required to become an expertise in the subject and effectively teach it. A student designing a summer assignment may replicate some of the positive aspects of teaching and effectively decipher the material. Students can increase their leadership skills through designing their own summer assignments. Student-designed assignments repel against the oppression of students to systematically think in the same manner and allow for critical thinking skills. In primary school, students are taught a solid foundation of knowledge from their teachers. However, in secondary school, they are encouraged to critically think about the knowledge they have obtained and form a judgment; thus, teachers guide them towards forming an intelligent judgment. This life skill is used on a daily basis, especially in the workplace when humans aren't given a manual for obtaining success. Students should design these summer projects as it promotes critical thinking from the students. Students would be require to form their own ideas as they rarely design a project for themselves. The students would critically think and use their best judgment to create the best project. They would not need a set of directions to control their thinking and limit their ideas. In addition, the oppression of student's creative thinking leads to burnout and loss of motivation. The education system heavily relies on strict teacher-designed assignments, which test the students' ability to follow the rubric in expectancy of a grade that determines the students' success. This type of assignment leads to burnout. Collectively, studies have shown that students lose motivation throughout the school year. This type of learning kills the students' imagination as they follow the directions and absorb the knowledge in a shallow manner. Students should design the summer assignments because it repels against the strict teacher-designed assignments. The students would not have to follow directions; they would create the directions. This type of assignment motivates the students to overcome the challenges of the making of a creation. Student-designed assignments allow for the students to critically think for themselves. Student-designed assignments create development. Some may say that the students are not qualified enough to design their summer projects, or that they lack the experience to create a student-designed project. However, the thought of limitation manifests into the actual limitation of the students and their lack of experience. Preventing students from attempting the challenge hinders development. The development of these students derives from taking risks, overcoming challenges, and experiences. Furthermore, a new idea allows for an improved version of a precedent principle. Similar to the United States justice system, the law is constantly reforming itself as humans obtain new knowledge and form new ideas. As new ideas develop in the world, the education system must follow as it is the core of our future's success. Student-designed assignments allow for development of the education system. Students should design their summer assignments due to the increase in leadership, critical thinking, and development. Schools should not abolish all teacher-assignment assignments as some are important in the education system and developing the student's thinking. However, they should implement more student-designed assignments as it benefits the students in multiple ways. These assignments would be the most effective in the summertime when students are continuing learning through their break. The assignments, in themselves, are evidence that students are making their own creations in a system which can limit this type of thinking. We should allow the students to ""want what [they] want to want."" ",,,,,,,
876,901,"Being active in school can be fun and educational, yet boring or unfair to the people who doesn't find extracurricular activities amusing. The fact that the principal says that every student should participate sounds a little pushy. I am against the principal's decision on the students taking extracurricular activities because of the following reasons. For example, not all students like sports, yearbooks, or student council. There are other varieties out there that students like such as; books, art, drama, music, culinary, and much more. The principal's decision isn't accurate for every student to participate in an extracurricular activity. Forcing every student to take one when they don't want to, is going to make them start skipping or not be interested in the class. They need to take a class that they're interested in. If they like music, they can join; band, orchestra, or chorus, if they like chess or drama, they can take a club for it. There can be a book club, chess club, drama club, or art club for the students that are interested or good at those things. Yet, having every student participate in an extra class can cause problems. Fights, financial, or overcrowding. In fact, the students schedule might be book and having them take an extra class they don't need can be stressful, even to the teachers that have to keep up with all their classes. Plus, it depends on if it's an after school activity or an activity during school hours because students do have a life outside of school that can be very important. For example, if the student is an athlete, then they would have to reschedule everything on that day or week, or if they have culinary class and have to bake a cake by next week, then they're going to have to cut everything short just to bake a cake in time. You don't want any student coming to school the next day stressful and tired. Therefore, making every student take an extra class doesn't make everyone happy. However, it is a good idea to participate, but there's always a catch. For example, taking a culinary class can teach you how ti cook, but you also have; soccer practice, band, student government, and chess club on the same day. It's already stressful enough that you have those 4 classes on the same day and to add an extra one that you don't need can cause you to be endlessly tired all the time. That's the catch. Being stressful and tired. And no, I mean no student should be going through that at a young age just because their pushy principal wants them to take an extra class. The principal's decision wasn't so bright. He didn't think fully through the pros and cons. Yes, extracurricular activities are helpful and educational, but not everyone agrees with it. It's stressful and problematic to the students and teachers. They really don't need to take another class, it really just depends on who it is and what they like to make them take an extra class. Not everyone can multitask.","Things are not always as they appear. This phrase means that you can't always take the first opinion off of something, and rely on it to be correct. This can relate on multiple things. The main one being that you shouldn't take one opinion for something. You should take multiple opinions on the topic. This is so you can get the full range of information out. The pros and cons of this concept. This is almost as if you were planning on going sky diving. You are unsure so you go and ask someone. They have no sky diving experience, and are afraid of heights, but you do not know that. So you ask them a few questions about it and they say you should not go. So you take there opinion and don't go. Then if you were to take multiple opinions on a certain task, you could get different perspectives. If you wanted to go sky diving, you would take multiple opinions. This is so you can get the full understanding of what you are getting yourself into. One person could say that they have not gone, and that it would be a terrible idea to go. So instead of just taking that one opinion, you go around and ask other people as well. These people say that they have gone sky diving before and that they had one of the best times of their lives. So you take the majority of opinions and go sky diving. This just goes to show that things are not always as they appear, and that you should take multiple opinions on almost everything. For another example, you want to go and explore a new cave on your on. The problem is, you have no cave exploration experience or knowledge. You go and ask just one person if it would be a good idea. Now exploring a new cave on your own would sound amazing to anyone. This person that you ask however, has cave exploring experience. They say that it is never a good idea to go by yourself, so you take their advice and do not go. If you were to try the same thing, but instead of asking just one person, you ask multiple people. You could get a different response. However, it is also possible to get the same response. Say instead of going and asking one person, you ask multiple people. All of the people you ask say they have cave exploring experience and knowledge. When in reality, they do not. You ask everyone and then write down all of the information, and a majority says you should go. The thing is, you wanted to do this on your own. So you do not tell anyone where you are going. You get to the cave and look around. You believe that is is safe so you start exploring. When you are only 20 feet in, the roof closes behind you and traps you inside The thing is, opinions do not always have to be on a mass amount of people. What also comes into effect is how much you trust this person. If you would ask someone you have never met, or if you would ask someone that you have known your whole life. Most people would choose to ask someone they have known, because they have a strong trust and belief that this person will help you make the right desicion. For example, say you want to try a new sport or occupation, like football. You go to the medical office and ask if it would be a good idea to play football. The doctors say that it would not end up being smart in the long run because, you have a condition that makes your bones extremely fragile. Even the weakest hit on you could end up breaking all of your bones and leaving you paralyzed for the rest of your life. So instead of listening to the doctors, you go and survey someone to see if you should play. The thing is, you don't mention your condition. Since this person doesn't know you, they do not know about your conditon. Now this person you survey is a football maniac, and they say you should play. You take their advice and play football. On the first play of the game, you get hit and are paralyzed. The doctors say you are paralyzed from the shoulders down, and will never be able to walk again. Say instead of surveying someone you have never met, you survey someone that you have know for your whole life. You ask them some questions on if you should play football, not mentioning your condition. Since this person knows you very well, they already know about your condition and say you should not play. You could get extremely hurt and maybe even paralyzed. So you take their advice and you don't play. Then in the next week you get an email from your doctor. It reads as if they had found a cure for your condition and if you take medicine, in the next month, you will be back to normal. For my conclusion, you should take multiple opinions on people you trust. Even if you think there is a chance someone or something is wrong, you are most likely correct. If you even ask just three people instead of one. You can get the full gist of the concept and make the right choice. This one little choice, could end up being something big. So when you ask multiple people for opinions, you are protecting your self from the dangers that are ahead in life.","Luke thought he couldn't give up this opportunity of going to the Europe on a cattle boat. It was only a opportunity of a lifetime but Luke couldn't say no. The story is kind of telling us if there's a only one lifetime opportunity then take it because it could go away and the chances of getting to go is probably in a couple of years or one year. Luke couldn't give it up, it was special to go. Luke wanted to go was because he knew it probably once in awhile and that his mom or dad or family member couldn't afford him to go to the Europe on a cattleboat. Luke instead went with his friend, Don, because it was nice of Don to let him come with him. That was so nice to Don. Not a lot of people is that nice to their friends, in fact a lot of friends are a lot mean to their best friends instead of caring for them. I know this because, "" He knew it was an opportunity of a life time."" Joining the program is very good news because not a lot of people gets to join the prgram because of A, they have a lot of things to do, or B, they can't afford anything. Luke probably thought it'll be interesting to go join the program they have. Joining the program is like helping out something, maybe helping animals, nature, the Earth, and the environment. To join the program I think it's going to be like doing hard work and helping with a lot of stuff and of coarse helping with other people with their work. Also the thing is that you got to be a hard worker to join the program other wise you probably couldn't get the thing. Of course the reasons Luke joined in was probably because he wanted to help even though it was kind of challenging but Luke knew he had it in him. I know this because in the text it states, ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" It's like telling us that Luke didn't know this was hard. Luke posibly thought it'll be easy for him to do. But it sucks to have a few cracked ribs and not going back to the job he had. In the text it states, "" Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Also I know, "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the Untited Nations Relief and Rehabililation Administartion)."" Luke is or maybe a hard worker when it comes to things that includes hard things in a job. Luke knows what to do since it's like his job to do what he was asked to do right. Luke was strong about when he cracked his bones. He gotten more stronger. Luke went back to his job and did it more better. Luke is probably a nice man then anyone else there in the group. Luke deserves much better than this what happened to him on the job he was doing. In the text it states, ""Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy."" Also I know, "" By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke has made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy."" Luke liked being the Seagoing Cowboy and he thought it was an amazing adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worled for him. He is grateful of the whole thing. In the text it states, "" 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says."" Luke thought it was very aware to other people and thathe could do this whole Seagoing Cowboy thing and be very cool about it. Luke had more fun because it helped the people in other countries in need like he possibly did at first. Luke thought this was awareness stayed with him. I know this because, "" And that awarreness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years. In the text it states, ""Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea.""","Can you detect a happy person to an excited person would you want to detect if someone has mixed emotions about you well ""Making Mona Lisa smile"" does that for you.

The vibe of walking down a street filled with the swish of bicycles passing by, and the chatter of wandering children has lowered the stress of nearly all residents. This ecofriendly, and stress-free enviroment is a trend that is growing and being adopted by many countries, including the U.S. From Chicago to Shanghai, this residential area may be the place for you. Paris, France, home to the famous Eiffel Tower even has its pollution problems. After days of uncontrollable smog, the ruling French party enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of thiis well-known city. They ruled that on Monday's even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and on Tuesdays, odd-numbered license plates were to do so as well. After this first trial, the congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France. This was a huge success since Paris typically has more pollution that other European capitals. Temporary laws like this have a huge effect on reducing the amount of pollution in crowded cities. Even the city of love has unclean air, how romantic is that? Limiting the usage of cars benefited this society immensely, and it could benefit our world as a whole if all of us chose to cut back our car usage at least twice a week. Automobiles are the Beyonce of suburbs, where families from California all the way to Sydney tend to make their homes. Experts have concluded that this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes all around the world. Passenger cars in Europe are only responsible for twelve percent of these emissions, while America is responsible for up to fifty percent. President Obama's goals to drastically curb these greenhouse gas emissions will be assisted by a shift in American behavior: Fewer Americans getting their license. Studies have shown less and less of Americas youth are prioritizing getting their license. If this pattern persists, it will have a beneficial effect on the reduction of carbon emissions being released into the environment. This calls for less pollution, and a more ecofriendly, healthy society for us all. In conclusion, limiting car usage in your daily life can cause a drastic change. These changes include a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, to less pollution, and a beneficial effect on carbon emissions. Our society as a whole has the opportunity to reduce car usage, so why not grab it while we have the chance. A healthier environment calls for a healthier you.         ","Dear Senator, The Electoral College has worked for many years but is becoming unfair to the average, everyday citizen.  I've recently analyzed the following articles: ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even best-laid defences are wrong"" by Bradford Plumner, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner. The United States of America should change to a popular vote for president to benefit the nation as a whole. If we use the popular vote system, the nation as a overall unit will have some benefits in return. In, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumner, it argues, ""voters vote not for a president, but for a slate of electors"". This statement is very much true. Citizens may think they vote for president, only to realize that he or she is chosen for them. The worst part of all, most don't know who the electors are. To strengthen, in, ""What is the Electoral College"", by the Office of the Federal Register, it claims, ""the meeting of the electors where they vote for president"". If this comes to be true, why even let citizens vote? Under this system, thier votes don't contribute to the presidential election. The presidential election should be by popular vote of the people. However, the Electoral College does have it's benefits. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, it indicates, ""no voter's vote swings a national election"". This will allow the electors of each state to decide which president if better for the particular state. One voter's vote could choose the wrong president that harms the nation and doesn't help it. It is clear to see that both sides have their own pros and cons, but the nation should use the system of popular vote. This allows the people of each state to choose which president benefits them. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME.    ","Imagine getting to design your own project for school during the summer! Students would have a lot of fun designing their own project! Students would get to enjoy their summer, while doing a school project in a fun way because they were allowed to design it themselves! Summer projects that are required from the school, should be student-designed because students would learn to be more responsible, students already have to do what the teachers assign them do during the school year, and students would have more fun with the school project if they got to design it themselves. Summer projects that are required from the school, should be student-designed. Firstly, summer projects that are required from the school should be student-designed because student would learn to be more responsible. Students would have to come up with their project on their own, so that would make them more responsible because students are used to teachers planning the work and the format of projects. This would also give students the opportunity to show their teachers and parents what they are capable of doing on their own. If students got to design their own projects, then they would have to take it seriously because its up to them and their grade will reflect how well they did. Designing their own projects would help them become more responsible and that is good to learn at a younger age for the future. Secondly, students already have to do what the teachers assign them to do during the school year, so I think that students should get to do what they want to do for their project during their break. Students summer break should be their time because thats their break away from school, so they should get to design their own project. It's good to give students more freedom because that makes students happier and it makes people feel good knowing that they get to design what they want to do instead of always having to do what the teachers want them to do. Students would have more confidence in themselves if they got to design their own project because students are used to having to reach a certain level to be approved or get a good grade. Students are used to doing what teachers want them to do during the school year, so students should at least get to do what they want to do during their break away from school. Lastly, students would have more fun with school projects if they got to design it themselves. I personally like designing my own things because it shows who I am instead of having to do what what other people want me to do. The information would stay in the students brain longer if they designed something on their own to help them remember the topics. Students are very creative and smart, but sometimes students dont get to show that because they are expected to do things exactly how the teachers want them to do things to get a good grade. Students would have more fun with learning if they got to design their own things and it would help them remember the information. Summer projects that are required for the summer should be student-designed. Students would have a lot more fun with school projects during the summer if they got to design it themselves. Students are capable of so much and I dont think that they get to show that sometimes because they always have to do what others want them to do. If students got to design their own projects, then that would help them in the future because they would learn how to be responsible. Students normally have to follow the teachers orders, so I think in the summer, students should have their own freedom when it comes to school because summer is the students break away form school. Students would have more fun with learning school information if they got to choose their own design and style of learning. Summer projects should be student-designed. ",,,,,,,
604,494,"I believe after-school activities should be a requirement made by every school across America. After-school activities have proven to help students with a variety of things in their school years. For example, students get easily recognized by various amounts of colleges for the activity they are doing. Another reason is it helps students make friends with people who enjoy the same things as them. Last but not least, it also allows students to experience something new and prepare them for the future. If my principal were to make my friends and I to do an extracurricular activity, I would agree to it. It is something to do and it is enjoyable. I think students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it helps students get noticed by colleges, it gives them a chance to make friends, and it gives them preparation for the future. Firstly, after-school activities give students a chance to get watched by colleges. Extracurricular activities are one of the main things colleges look for. For example, my brother signed up for B-Tech to do engineering. After hearing about it, Virginia Tech started watching him and has invited him to their campus plenty of times. Along with getting noticed, students also have a chance of getting scholarships. Scholarships are a huge deal to many kids and teens who want to go to college. Although earning a scholarship is like getting into The Olympics , it is still possible and it doesn't hurt to try. Scholaships have been helpful to many athletes and doctors throughout the years, so why wouldn't they be helpful to the kids who want to succeed as well? After all, it can be helpful to anyone, and perhaps a student is striving to earn one right now. Another reason students should join an activity is it helps them make friends. Making friends in an environment students enjoy is the easiest way to make friends. The students who are in the same activity probably enjoy some of the same things as the other kids around them, making it easier to converse with them. It also teaches students to be more outgoing, which can help them with future problems, like speaking up. Students can be more comfortable and confident around kids just like them. Even if kids don't want to make new friends, they can join a club with their current friends and spend more time with them. Having friends within the activity can prevent the activity from being boring. Lastly, not only can it help students make friends in the activity, but it shows that the students involved might be interested in something other kids might have not expected from them. This makes them more attractive, enjoyable, and unpredictable, which are characteristics that help attract friends. Along with the other reasons, activities can help prepare students for the future. These activities require time management, which is something many kids don't understand or haven't learned. Time management is helpful for the future when students get jobs and need to work out hours with their boss. It not only helps with time management, but what students want to do in the future as well. Students aren't prone to enjoy the first club they try or even the fifth, but it can help them find a new hobby. A new hobby may not seem like a big deal, but it can end up being what the student wants to do in the future and go to college for. It also trains them for that profession they want to succeed in. High schools have the availability of many different clubs and activities, so why not try them? Students have the capability of joining something, and if they don't like it, at least they tried it and now they know not to do it later in life. In conclusion, I believe students should join a club or an after school activity. It helps with many things the students may need in the future or strive for later in life. Kids who have the ability to join something that may change their life should join whatever might impact them and their future. Even if they might not see it, it helps them a long way into the future and opens up opportunities that might not be available to every child. Students should join activities and clubs whether they are required or not. It has so many benefits, I don't see why students shouldn't join. They can make friends, get noticed by colleges, find new hobbies, prepare for the future, and so much more. Overall, students can find success by just trying something they may have never before. Something that may seem like a simple activity or a ""hang-out"" can turn into something so much more. ",Hi im luke and I think you should join the seagoing cowboy's I have really been inspired and had fun there is a bunch of neat thing's to see you can ride a boat for free but I will tell you if you dont want to do a little hard work this job is probally not right for you but if youre aperson who like's helping other's or you're not scared to get your hand's dirty this would be a good job because we see alot of happy face's and smiles. And that is because we bring people food livestock and make the hard time's easier for them because everyone want's to be treated the same so do it and help. But if youre a person who want's to do work to be rewarded then you still might want to help we get to go over sea's and see a bunch of exotic animal's elsewhere plus vacation spot's like touring a excavated castle or see the panamal canal and taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy. But the price is not paying a bunch of money but doing a little bit of work and on board you can do thing's like volleyball reading and ping-pong championship's. But like I said I can see where someone else might come from because the work isn't alway's easy like feeding the animal's an watering them alot cleaning out the stall's but like I said everything has it's ups and downs and turn around's and some people would enjoy my work. But if you want to try it out come on down to the sea cowboy's and have a good time.,"Ever been in a car accident due the you or the other driver focusing on cellular devices instead of the road? Have you ever been afraid of having your child drive due to the amount of accidents caused by driver's using their cell phone or any other hand held device? Driver's shouldn't be able to use their cellular devices while in operation of a vehicle. Not only because it directs their focus from the road. But it also increases the overall risk of driving on highways and interstates. Now while driving your attention should be on two and only two things, the road in front of you and the driver's around you. If your using your cellular devices while driving that's one more thing you have to pay attention to. Not every human can multitask and those who can aren't able to do it well enough to have one hand turning the wheel the other holding a cell phone typing a response to your bestie about how Jacob is a terrible person while our eyes bounce back and forth between the screen and the road. What if while you take a few seconds to type a word a car comes speeding around the corner and you can't react fast enough to swerve out of the way. According to the studies on Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance in volume 27 number 4 details that multitasking is less effective due to your brain having to mentally shift tasks. Which cannot be afforded to do while driving on a open road with other people. As well as the fact that driving while using your cell phone increases the risk of driving, not only for yourself but the other around you. Think about it if your distacted you are prone to make mistakes, which can be fatal when driving, if you were to turn a little too sharply or not enough it can easily lead to a crash. That puts not only you and the others in your car at risk but everyone else on the same road as well. According to the National Safety Council texting while driving has lead to an astonishing 1.6 million crashes PER YEAR. Now if the risk of crashing that high why take the chance? Now some people may argue that ""I'm a better driver than others i can text and drive"" or "" No way that can happen to me."" One, get off your high horse their buckoo. Two, According to ACTUAL fact from the National Safety Council 1 in 4 for crashes in the United States will be caused by drivers texting and driving. Is your life really worth a 75% chance that you can get this last text off? In conclusion, People shouldn't be able to text and drive. If you do you increase the risk of driving which isn't the best thing to do with a already risky activity with roads full of others that you can't tell what they're thinking. But you also distract yourself from the road and it only takes one mistake to cause a deadly crash. So knowing the risks is that last text to Sally really worth your life? 1.      ","Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer. Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests. Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates. In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions.","school policy It has come to my attention TEACHER_NAME i understand that you like the students to be very well educated, and i see that you want them to be the best they can but for some student that is not the case. Some students want to play sports and do good at school but sometimes they are ineligible to maintain a b average. Most of the time the kids that are playing sports feel that they cant play because they feel that they will not be able to maintain a c average and they could not play. also it has come to my attention that the players that are on a team at the moment seem to be doing fine and need no help to bring their grades up. If you raise the grade average it could not only become a struggling manner for the player but also the league. By raising the average most players may not be eligible to play on the team and with not enough team members to play on the team they will have to shut down the team. Now i see that your argument is a very valid one and that every kid should stride for perfection but some kids and not only that but also the extra curricular events while maintaining these grades such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, cheerleading, and hockey. They should stride to be the best at every class and not only that but the sport they are currently active in at the moment.","Many schools around the United States offer a multitude of online classes that students can take from home. In matter of fact, these classes can be electives or actual course classes, like English or math class. Furthermore, students having the opportunity to enroll in online classes can be super beneficial in many different ways. For example, students who may have disabilities can take online courses to make school easier for them or students who do after school activities, like sports can take online courses so they will have more time to do homework or complete other classwork. Even though many people would agree that taking online classes is beneficial, others believe that it isn't beneficial at all. First off, the majority of schools around the United States all have students who may have a disability. Unfortunately, for some of these students with disabilities, it may be hard for them get up on their own or even leave their houses. For these students to have the opportunity to enroll in online classes that their school offers, this can be greatly beneficial for them in a lot of ways. For example, these students won't have to worry about falling behind in school or missing anything important. Also by taking classes at home, will help them still get the right education they need in order to be successful in school, so they won't miss out due to their circumstances. As a matter of fact, I have a personal experience with taking online classes. Personally, it helped me a lot and I really enjoyed taking an online course both my freshman and sophomore year of high school. Furthermore, I am athlete who trains for five hours everyday right after school, and I found it very challenging to juggle between student life and athlete life. I knew I had to do something that would help me balance my school work and my practices. Having the opportunity to enroll in an online class, so I would have more time to complete homework and other classwork and still be able to train for my sport was probably the best offer I have ever got and it really benefited me in both student life and athlete life. Although many people would agree that online classes are very beneficial for students, there are others who would strongly disagree with that for many reasons. To continue, people think that students having the opportunity to take online classes won't help benefit them at all, because students will be distracted at home and won't pay attention in class. Also, others believe that students will cheat their way through the class and won't actually learn anything. Adding on, what these people need to realize is that the majority of students who take online classes take them for a specific reason, and it is mostly to help benefit them in school. In my experience with online classes, it greatly benefited me and many others who did the online class with me. In conclusion, a lot of schools around the United States offer online classes for students to enroll in. These online courses are offered in a variety of different types of classes. Such as, English, math, and even art classes, that students can take throughout the year. Furthermore, having the opportunity to take these classes can help benefit students who may have disabilities or who are involved in after school sports. Although many people would agree that students having the opportunity to take online classes can be beneficial, there are others who would highly disagree and believe it isn't beneficial at all.  ","Generic_Name and Generic_Name are on their way to the pet store in seek of a household pet that can accompany them. They want to get a dog, but don't know how to take care of one. ""How should we find information about taking care of a dog?"" Generic_Name said with tear filled eyes. ""I don't know but we should ask around the pet store for help."" Generic_Name said. Generic_Name looked at him in confusion and said, ""Why don't we just ask the person who works in the dog department?"" Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name with a wide grin and explained, ""It's better to ask more than one person when getting information because everyone has a different view on dogs and how to take care of them."" Generic_Name then understood as they walked around the store asking different store employees about what they need and what they need to do to take care of a dog. Not everyone's opinion or advice is valid or important in certain circumstances. This means just asking a singular individual on a topic might not be the best choice or even give you the best advice. People should seek and ask multiple sources on advice because they get clearer information, see different view points, and get more feedback. First off, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get clearer information on a topic. For example, I went to a website to search for how to stay calm when your stressed. It didn't give me a clear answer so I searched up another site. This one told me exact steps and procedures on how to calm yourself in a stressful situation. It gave me a better understanding on why looking at multiple sources can give someone better and clearer information. In addition, when my sister needed help at swim practice, she asked multiple people on her swim team how to do a certain stride instead of asking just one person. This helped her see an arrangement of different techniques that gave her different perspectives on how to do the one stride correctly. Later, she went up to her coach and asked her for clarification on how to do the move as well. This helped her choose whether she needed to practice her stride more or just to improve on little alterations. This leads into the next topic on how different view points can help someone make a better choice. Next, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can see from different view points. For example, I looked at reviews on a product before buying it to see what other people's opinions on the product were. If I were just to have bought the product without reading whether it would work or not, it could result in me losing my money and having a useless product. Seeing other peoples different views and opinions can alter my own opinion and lead me to a better choice in a product to pick from. Additionally, my dad, when he was picking out a cat from a shelter, took into great consideration of the advice the workers gave him on what he needed to take care of a cat and how. However, he also asked around with people in the cat owner community who helped him out as well. The different view points that the shelter and the cat owner community had were vital in the way that gave him the proper tools and techniques to use when taking care of a cat. This leads to the final example on how asking for advice from multiple people can give someone more feedback which helps them in making a choice. Finally, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get more feedback. Furthermore, my cousin plays the trumpet at a professional level and most of the time needs feedback on his performances to see how he did. After his shows, he usually asks some audience members how he preformed and if he could improve in someway what could he improve on. It really helps him see what he needs to do better on by asking multiple people, rather than just asking a singular trumpeter in his band. It also helps him decide if he needs to practice more or if he sounded amazing and preformed at the best of his ability. As well as, when I record a video of me playing my instrument I ask more than one person for feedback. I email my band instructor on how I did and on how I can improve for later performances. I then ask my mom and dad on how I did by playing the video for them and ask if they heard that I sounded squeaky, or if I need to redo my video because the sound quality is low as well as other things. The more feedback I have on how I did, the better of chances I have improving my playing skills along the way. Generic_Name and Generic_Name walk out of the pet store with nothing more than a dog and the essentials for owning one. They both give each other a wide smile and a sigh of relief as they walk home with their new family member. ""Thanks for asking around on how to care for Fluffy,"" who Generic_Name had named. ""It was way better than just asking one person for everything we needed!"" Generic_Name looked at her again with a stern face, ""Now you know the important's of not just asking one person for advice, but for asking multiple people to see their opinions and options on certain topics. Just because they don't have an answer doesn't mean that no one does."" Generic_Name looks at him with a gloomy face and apologizes for her misunderstanding. ""Feedback from others will also help us change and better our understanding on how to take care of our dog."" As they continue to walk home, they both realize that not everyone's advice is good and not everyone is bad. But asking multiple people for help does give you a better understanding than just one straight forward answer. Some people's opinions in some situations won't help you in making a better decision. In conclusion, people should seek and ask multiple sources on advice because you get clearer information, see different view points, and get more feedback.",,,,,,,
604,757,"Extracurricular activities is something that doesn't always amaze kids especially not by force. A extracurricular activity are things such as sports, run for student council, work on the yearbook. As a principle of any school you should want a child to participate in some kind of activity but that's not something that should be forced on them. It may seem like a good idea to enforce a rule that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, but in my perspective I don't like the principles idea and I have a couple of reasons why. The first reason is because, as a kid we don't like being forced to do things. Yes, it's good to give a child a push at something so they can try a new thing and maybe it will be apart of their future; but if a principle or person forces it on them it may stop the child from doing it ever again. They may get the idea that they have no say in what they do. My next reasoning is that what if a child takes his or her time doing another activity outside of school, handling both things could be a lot of pressure and cause stress because they still have several other things to worry about. The kid might get to thinking ""this is to much"" and ""this is a lot to worry about"" and it may cause them to not want to do anything in life if they don't find what they're doing is something they enjoy. The principle should make it a option instead of a rule or something you have to do. I believe whatever activity a child participates in they should be willing to do it and should be something they are amazed by. The principle should take his idea into thought and see how the students feel. The students should have good reasoning for why they agree or disagree with the principle. The point behind my reasons is that as a adult you have to consider what the child wants sometimes. What you may think is best for a child isn't always what they want. If you demand them to do a lot of things their whole mind set could change on how life should be. ",You should join the seagoing cowboys. I think you should join them because it willl be fun.

I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference. The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others. Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations. In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!             ","With summer break comes the joy of sleeping in and spending the day with friends, allowing students to be free from the stress that school may cause them. However, as students enjoy their freedom, they end up losing the knowledge they have carefully built up over the course of the school year. To combat this issue, some schools have implemented summer projects that students must complete over the course of their summer break. The issue with the mandatory summer projects is whether or not they should be designed by the students or by the teachers. Some may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial, but teacher-designed projects ensures that the project's purpose is fulfilled and that student can receive the help they need. While it can be said that creating the project would allow the students to retain the information better, there is no guarantee that the information itself would be accurate. Any student can make a worksheet or an assignment based on what they have learned, but few can do it correctly. If student-designed projects are done incorrectly, then the purpose of the project is completely disregarded; the entire point of the summer projects is to make sure students do not forget valuable information. Having teacher-designed projects is a safer and more reliable option. Teachers have studied the subject for years and have experience, meanwhile students are only just beginning to understand the concepts of the subject. Teachers must be able to determine whether or not what they are doing with their students is not superficial, but actually necessary and needed for the students. The projects designed by teachers provide a safety net for their students, while the projects designed by students would be a gamble. Though it is important that students are able to successfully work on their own, their ability to collaborate with peers and help one another is extremely beneficial for them. Making students design their own project is not only extremely stressful, it also isolates them from other students and from help. Teacher-designed projects would be uniform, meaning every students receives the same project. It would allow them to look to classmates for help if needed, or to even work together as a unit to get the project done. The collaboration would lessen the burden on the students and would also let them enjoy their summer break. Creating their own projects would quickly become overwhelming for students, especially if they have no one to turn to for support. Instead of focusing on the information like they are supposed to, the panicked students would focus only on finishing their assignment before it is due, thus defeating the purpose of the project. The main goal of summer projects is to provide students with a way to retain everything they have learned and to be prepared for their next school year, regardless of who creates the projects. To best achieve this goal, teachers should be the ones who design the projects. Teacher-designed projects would provide everything that students will need, as well as allow them breathing room during their well deserved break from school. Overall, teachers designing the projects would be a win-win for everyone involved. The students would feel confident and prepared, while the teachers would not have to worry about going over concepts from the year prior. At the end of the day, as long as the students feel comfortable and prideful of their work that was created by a teacher, then that is all that matters.","School sports have always been very important, to both the students and the school. They have been played for decades and are very entertaining to watch. It helps show pride in your school, but is that really what the purpose of school is about? Most students would argue against this policy but I think that it is the right thing to do. There are many reasons why students with below a B average should not participate in school sports. First, if they have below a B average that means that they are struggling so instead of playing sports they should be studying and by playing school sports that enables them to do that. Also the purpose of school is to learn. Kids can play sports outside of school but school should not be about sports. And lastly many kids play school sports because they believe that they will prosper to become something better. But realistically the chances of going pro or even playing in college sports are very slim. Almost everyone will make their living off of what they learned in school and many students need to understand that. Overall students should not participate in school sports with under a B average. Many people may argue that they have the right to do whatever they want and I condemn that. But not when it comes to school. School is a place to learn and students with under a B average should be out trying to raise that grade. I hope by reading this that you will realize that this is the right thing to do, no matter how many critics there may be.","No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always. Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes. Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school. Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer. In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more","Don't Fear, Ask Your Peers! Have you ever done something stupid? Well, if you got someone else's opinion before you did it, would you have done it? Seeking others opinion before doing something is helpful because you get many different view points and reduces the chances of risk. First, everyone has many different experiences,that means we all can have different view points. Having different view points can help you make wise and profound dissensions. People often need help with school assignment. Asking for others view points on a project or homework can help someone do better on it and get a better grade. Another example is sports, getting someone else's opinion can help improve your playing style and skill level. Also, when get more then one view point, you are more likely to do the right thing. For example, if someone is doing something questionable, someone who has done it or seen the consequences of doing it, can attempt to stop them. Secondly, if you ask for others opinions before you act, you reduce the chances of risk. While yes, risk can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing. For example, someone is trying to jump off the roof of their house to impress their friends. If someone doesn't tell them to stop they may hurt themselves or others. Another, less stress educing example is, someone wants to use profanity in their English paper for excitement. If someone tell them to stop, the risk of getting in trouble is greatly decreased or goes away altogether. It it always best to recuse stress. In conclusion, ask for others opinions. Everyone makes mistakes and its okay but It is extremely helpful to ask for your peers opinion because it can help reduce risk and you can get many different view points.",,,,,,,
604,923,"Generic_Name Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way. Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation. Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there. It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"". I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders. Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude. Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts. So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity. Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.","Man, I enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to help so many people! You should sign up! The purpose of Seagoing Cowboys was to help countries that have suffered from WW2, such as Greece and China. It was created by UNRRA, and was very helpful to all critical European countries. A few reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because we bring horses, cows, and muless to countries in need and we also take care of these animals. You also have some time for sightseeing. However, there is some danger of signing up. Seeing as you´re on a boat most of the time with hundreds of animals, you have limited space, and then you have the dangers of the sea. When I say dangers of the sea I mean things like drowning, storms, et cetera. Now, I want to tell you about how I got into Seagoing Cowboys, and my story of being one. It was 1945. I had two part-time jobs at the time, and my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to join him in going to Europe on a cattle boat. World War 2 had just finished, and lots of European countries were in a critical state. 44 nations joined to make the UNRRA, and they hired people to take care of cattle that were being shipped. Don and I both signed up. In August, we were told to go to New Orleans for our job. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, a cattle boat with more than 300 horses. I was discharged in 1947, and I had made history. I made 9 trips, which is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It was impressive, seeing as I couldn´t work for a few days due to broken ribs. I was so proud of myself, and it was definitely more than a job, it was a way to help me be more aware of others´ needs. Well, I have to go back to my job at the supermarket. I recently was rehired and got my position back in the meat department. Now, isn that ironic? Remember, if you have the chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy, take it! It´ll open up so many parts of the world to you. ","Phones & Driving Isn't driving a vehicle without cellular devices distracting and stressful enough?? I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference. The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others. Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations. In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!             ","Teachers design the worst summer projects ,in some schools it is required that students should complete a summer project to make sure that they are still learning something during their break ,but some schools give out summer projects that the teacher design. Most students would agree that student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways such as they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity abilities,and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing. First,when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may not know or can not get a grasp of because it is too difficult for them to understand. And in some cases if it is too difficult for them the chances of them just giving up and not trying are pretty high. That is why if they pick their topic or subject for their project it may lead to a better outcome. Then you will see a lot more from that one students project. Second,summer projects are for people with creative minds and want to do so much to their project and make it look nice,but they would have to be limited mainly because it has to go by what the teacher assign. But if that is the case then if the teacher did not choose the project then the creativity would go through the roof due to the many of creative minds of students and they would be limitless. And the outcome of the summer project would look stunning. Finally,when given the project from the teacher it may come to a surprise that some students may not be interested into that one subject or topic that they are learning,so they would lose interest in the whole project and not put effort into it. But if it is for a topic or subject that they are interested in and that they can choose the teacher would fully capture their interest and the student may put effort into the project. And if they know so much about that one thing then you are sure going to see a lot of things down on that project. One can argue that this is not a good idea for students on choosing their project one reason one could say is that it may lack focus ,that this curtain thing wont help them in life, and that they need to know more important things in school so that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher to know the understandings of their students. So in conclusion, student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways that they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity,and the students may be really interested in the project that they are doing. And this can help them do more well in school due to that one summer project.","STUDENT_NAME March 2, 2011 Dear Principal, I have just discovered this new policy you have decided that us as students can't participate in school sports unless we have a grade B average. I do not think this is a very good policy because if you are really good in sports, but your not the best at science, or math or any subject that wouldn't fair to them. I personally have one subject I am not doing very well in, but I try and do my work and maintain the average of low B and high C. So that would consider me unable of not doing any sports. I love sports, my life revolves around sports. But just because I'm not doing good in one subject that doesn't mean I can't be part of something that makes me happy, makes me health. I also think that if you make this policy happen, kids may turn bad. if you make this happen you will just help the population of kids turning to bad influences. I know from experiences that the kids that have been on my team in the past were good at the sports they did and instead of going to a party or going in the woods to do bad things, we were at practice working as hard as we can just to win divisions, or even states. There were girls in the past who couldn't do math or didn't understand some subjects but they tried hard and maintain an A, B or C average. It wouldn't be fair to the girls who try in school, but just aren't good at the subject. My last reason is that if you change this policy, you could ruin the chances of some kids who are amazing at sports chances of getting a scholarships in sports. I know for one thing me personally I want a scholarship so badly, and I work for it too. But if I get a C in one subject that could ruin my chances of practicing and competing. Which is really hurtfully because I've worked my whole life for a scholarship. So instead of me or anyone being a pro or being an Olympic winner, we'll be working at Subway for the rest of our life's earning practically nothing. And I don't want my future to come to this quote, "" Welcome to Subway, what can I get you?"" In the end, I hope that you don't change the policy, because if you do a lot of kids will have there whole life changed and maybe even ruined. And its not like a C isn't passing because it is and you should have a passing grade to play sports. Most people in school have a C or B average because its most common. And as a Principal you should be the one supporting us to be in sports and after school actives, you should know that most parents say to their kids is to get involved. In conclusion I hope you make the choice that benefits us all as students and a school. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning. The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general. Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems. Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state. For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school. One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment. On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice. In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.","Generic_Name March 13, 2020 English SOL Generic_School #2 block Do you need help when it comes too challenging sitituions and problems? Things aren't that easy in the world when sititutions you just don't know what to do, seeking or asking for someone advice is very help in a way. For example picking an new outfit for school you like two choices but don't know which one to pick because the two outfits are both cute so you ask one of your family members or ask a friends for their opinions on which outfit is the best looking. There are problems in life where you just don't know what direction to go in. Asking a good amount of people for their advice or their options are good so you can see an other person point of view or perspective of what they seem is good or bad for the sitituions. Like looking for a car isn't that easy there are so many brands,colors and other feature on a car you might like and it might be more than one you like but just don't know what to choice. Advice can be and good, helpful thing or bad, hurting thing some people are gonna give you good advice that can help you in a way and some people are gonna give you horrible advice that can hurt you in a way, say you are dealing with a sitituion with your boyfriend or girlfriend some people advice is gonna be that y'all should talk and work the problems out well on the other hand someone is gonna tell you that you don't need him or her or that person should apologize first when you were wrong and you might listen. It depends are what kind of sititution a person is in on what type of advice too give that person. However ther people advice might not sastifed you or help you so something you just might have to go with your own advice and opinions.             ",,,,,,,
397,494,dear TEACHER_NAME we think we all should be allowed to bring your phone to school and use them during a lunch periods but as long as the phone is off or we should be able to use the phone to because it might be an emergency for us too. you just never know when something could appear to happen. and the teachers should do the same thing so it would be the same amount and it would be fair to both of us to students and teachers. so we wont be bored either for example if we are done with an assignment or maybe we should do are work at the same time while we are using are phone. and plus middle school students like to chat with their friends and every body likes to text the most cause middle school students think that we are adults now and we should be trusted to use are phone in middle school all the time. because we are almost there to being an adult. but for now we are young adults. we should be starting to be using are phone so we can get ready for high school. so that way we will become smart and we will really become into real adults.,I feel like the presidential election should be decided by popular vote. This way seems easier to handle and simplier. The electoral college is to complex for some people and the popular vote is easier to count and manage. The popular vote is the best way to decide the presidential election because it shows what the people want and you dont want a not liked president. A not liked president could be bad for the economy and it could possibly cause havoc and chaos. The electoral college is to complex and unfair. The presidential election should be based on who the people like and vote for not a state of electors. The electoral college is unfair because the candidate that most people want to be president might not win because of the state of electors who could betray the presidential candidate and vote for a diffrent presidential candidate. the popular vote is easier to handle and manage. &nbsp,"After I graduated from high school I made a life changing choice and that was to go to Europe with my friend and while I was in Europe I joined the ""Seagoing Cowboys"". And I want you to make that same choice. And I dont want you to just think that im asking you to join for no reason im asking you to join because the benifits are really good. I also would want you to join because you can travel all around the world and help animals who need help. Wouldnt you want to travel around and help animals in need? And on top of that you meet new people and it may seem like work but it dosent feel like work at all its actually pretty fun. If i were you i would join right now. The list of reasons go on and on but if I were to write them all down I would need to write a book. So instead of me writing a book why dont you just join and I promise you will love it.

The technology could keep peoples mind focused and maybe make them more open minded. Like if you were sad and the computer detected that then the computer might pop up a game or video hat could make you feel differently. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. The muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. The conclusion to this statement is that new technology could be a good thing doing through the decades of the universe. Mostly because some people dont know how to show their emotions, or hide them from their friends and family and could really be feeling self vulnerable or have a very low self esteem of themselves.   ","In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" a writer states that scientists are trying to study the planet Venus. In his article, he claims that while it is very risky, it may be worth it in the end. he also gives details about how dangerous it really is, and what the planet might have been at one point in time. In the second paragraph, The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size."" but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" Plus, on its surface, ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure. Not only is high temperatures and extreme pressures an issue, he also states that there are volcanoes and major earthquakes that happen, plus lightning is constant as well. But there is no context to whether or not scientists are trying to figure out what causes the the powerful earthquakes to happen, or why lightning strikes frequently happen. He also states that, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" But there is nothing that follows it that claims what happened or could have happened to cause high pressures, high temperatures, and a high level of carbon dioxide to form. While scientists believe that Venus was at one point like earth, there are some facts that show that it has the looks of earth in some ways. the writer says that Venus, ""has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These features are exactly what earth has as well. But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that,"" peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" This issue puts a damper on scientists ability to study the planet. But thats just it, what are scientists trying to study. The article says,""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.'' Which is great they are working on that, but what are they trying to collect, find, or explore. Overall, the article is good, but there needs to be more detail in what is happening. they need information on what scientists are specifically trying to study, what they are looking for, and more detail on how they are progressing in studying Venus. With more details about what they are trying to find, it would be easier to evaluate whether or not the scientist efforts are really worth it, or just a waste of time. A planet that is inhabitable by humans or anything living is already a risk as is.       ","While the idea of having a fully-autonomous is very real, scientists are still very far from it. Research is being conducted every day to improve the efficeincy and safefty of these new semi-autonomous vehicles. In my opinion, driverless cars are inevitable and I would not doubt that I will end up seeing one in my lifetime. But as of right now, cars can't do as much as scientists are hoping for in the future. With that being said, I will there will be a more positive outcome of driverless cars than negative. Many skeptics say dirverless cars will never be possible. But, what they don't realize is that we are closer than we ever have been before regardless of how much research is still necessary to succesfully make a fully autonomous car. Google's concept car has been able to drive over half a million miles without a crash. Their car still requires a driver, but it is only for more advanced tasks such as traffic issues or roadwork. Other companies have also attempted to create a driverless concept car and the concepts have showed potential. They are far from driverless but they are going in the right direction. BMW announced that their car could handle driving speeds of up 25 mph but still require the focus of a human being behind the wheel. While I am very supportive of driverless cars, I think there will always be flaws, no matter the size. I think there will always be malfunctions but that does not mean that those can be fixed either. The research that has been put into these vehicles have been very strenuous and have proven that there will never not be flaws in creating an autonomous car. They still may crash but the probability of a fatal crash in a driverless is much lower than the probability of a fatal crash due to human error. Humans get distracted thus creating more chances for an accident to occur. With driverless cars, there is no chance of human error or the car getting distracted because driving is what it was built for. There are not many current laws or regulations on autonomous cars, so even if Google or BMW were to finish research and create a flawless and driverless car, they wouldn't be able to manufacture them on a commercial level. This is because there wouldn't be any laws covering liability in the case of an accident, if an accident were to somehow occur. It is undetermined who would be at fault for the accident according to the state. I think the company should be more at fault, considering they are advertising these cars as ""driverless"". With my opinion on driverless cars being said, I still think they are a good idea and will benefit society in the long run and keep more people safe. There are bumps in the road regarding laws and the time it will take to get to where big name companies want to be. But, if we are all patient and let scientists conduct quality research, I see a bright future for fully autonomous cars.","Have you ever asked advice from anyone? How many times have you asked? Asking advice is pretty important if you're one of those people that depend on people to make your decisions. But why should we ask multiple people for advice? Well lets start off by how advice is important. Advice is a suggestion or recommendation that a person gives to you in order help in your decision-makings. It can affect your life greatly by which choices you make. So that's why it's important to get feedback from multiple people. Once you have gathered information from other people, you can compare other people's responses with others to see what would be good or bad. One example was when I asked my friends which sports I should play. I came up to at least 10 or more of my friends for advice. Then I compared some answers with others. And it seems that a lot of people thought I was good a Basketball. So I tried it out, and it was the perfect sports for me. But still, why should we ask multiple people for advice? We rely on others everyday in our lives. Either by life choices or just helping people. There are many ways to help people, but we mostly help people with advice. Asking several different people is a great way to get advice. You could ask you parents, friends, uncles, anybody! Recently, I went on a trip to the mountains. I was either deciding if I wanted to ski or snowboard when I got there. Wasn't sure of my decisions, I asked my family members and friends. out of 8, 6 said skiing because it was easy and it was my first time. So I agreed. Opinions can vary when asking many different people. It's good to ask for many different opinions. Otherwise you won't come out with a good outcome. Another example could be during science class. Sometimes you have to try the experiment 50 times in order to make your final outcome or decision. Why should we ask multiple people for advice? How does it benefit you? As a result of asking many people for their opinion, many people have matured in life making better choices. This benefits us as a person when we grow up to make our own decisions. So that's why advice can really be important in tough choices. So always try to get advice from your peers when you need it.",,,,,,,
397,757,"Dear principal, I really think you should go with policy one. because kids in school will start to take them out anyway and you will have to take tons of phones away. The students will not be happy with policy one because it prohibits all cell phones. Cell phones do not cause controversy. if you were to take cell phones away completely it will make kids in your school create riots. They will be angry at teachers for not allowing people to have their phones out during lunch hours. I really think you should allow cell phones on campus. As long as they do not take them out in class it should be ok. Also some parents tell their kids to never turn their phone off in case of emergency. i really think that is a big deal. What if something is going on at home and they need you to know about it as soon as possible. You would have no idea what happened until you left school and got home. Something really severe could have happened during that time. Another reason you should allow cell phones as in policy one is that if you didn't allow them at all and anybody took them out they would be taken. Kids would be really angry. They would start to go on riots and get extremely mad at the principal for allowing this rule. Nobody in your school would be happy and it would be torn apart. Sometimes kids have medicine and their parents have to contact them but they would not be able to because of the policy. Please allow kids to have their cell phones out during passing periods and lunch time. It would save the school so much grief. The kids in your school would like to be there. But also now how the times are you have touch screens and unlimited internet search and things like that. People would go crazy because they cant do all that during passing periods and lunch. When you would get home you would spend all of your time on your phone and not doing homework. So please i say once more, allow kids to use their phones during passing periods and lunch. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear, Senator PROPER_NAME My name is PROPER_NAME and i am attending SCHOOL_NAME in LOCATION_NAME. I have recently been learning about the electoral college. i have been learning alot about it, actually, and i have to say. the electoral college sounds like a really bad idea! First off, swing states? that sounds completely unfair. sure its good for states like Texas, California, and New york. but what of the smaller states like Montana, or Maine, or Wyoming even? they deserve as much of a voice as the others. Also, this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country! Again. everyones wishes should be accounted for. Now im not saying that popular vote is perfect either but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong. If something gets tied then they just throw the vote to the house of represenitives. I think if there is a tie that it should result in a re-election. But thats probably just me (personally i think it should be like the hunger games). Well thats really all I have to say. I hope you read this letter and maybe you can send it to your superiors or whoever it is you work for to get my letter read by the President. And see if we can fix this problem here. Yours Truly, PROPER_NAME            ","Do you want to be a seagoing cowboy? I was once, and I think that the experience is very fun-filled and educational. You will meet many different types of people on your journey. Does it sound fun? Well, here are some reasons that you should decide to become a seagoing cowboy. First off, you will find that there is always something to do on board the ship, I found that there are many things to do so you can pass time. I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed on return trips after the animals were unloaded. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games were some of the activities that we did. Also, when you are off the ship and you need something to do, you can explore the surrounding area. On my trips, I toured an excavated castle, saw the Acopolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are many things to see and do anywhere you are. Lasty, you always know that the things that you do help many people in many ways. I always loved seeing the smiling faces of the people that I gave my time and energy into helping them. The people that we helped were survivors of World War II. Their belongings were destroyed, and most of their countries were left in ruins. We gave them food supplies, animals, and more. So, do you want to be a seagoing cowboy now? If you do, thats great! The experience lets you remember that what you did changed peoples lives forever. If I had the chance to become a seagoing cowboy again, I would take it. This made me more aware of what life was like for other people.        ","The Facial Action Coding Systems is valuable in a classroom because it makes things in the classroom go more effectively if a student doesn't understand. It will also help if a student or your friend is not feeling ok this machine could help prevent anything bad happening, or help your friend or student have a better day. This machine can help in so many ways and it is very valuable in the classroom for many people. Yes, it might get distracting at times for some people but it is still very helpful. In the article it states ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical inmformation as electronic code."" The machene is so very helpful and is can help in so many ways. One reasone the machine is effect is because of school purposes, it helps the teacher make the lesson more clear to others who don't understand and helps kids who don't understand pass the class. in the article it states ' ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'...'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This reveals that the machine can help a student and a teacher all in one because it can modify things for you and it can help a teacher out by explaining it more to a student who doesn't understand. Another reason why the machine is so effective is because if someone such as a family or friend is having a bad day you can by the look on their face. Although can you really tell what they are actually feeling. The machine can do it all, it can tell you how you're feeling just by the look on you face wich most people can not do. In the article it states ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial mucles precisely enough to convvey specific emotions."" This unveils that the machine can show you your specific emotions and tell you exactly how you are feeling. This also proves that the machine is very affective and can be helpful in so many ways. This machine is valubale in the classroom and is very much needed. All of your emotions on the machine arwe compared to a nuetral face so that means all of your emotions willl be precise and really will tell you your exact emotion. In conclusion the machine is very effect and can be used in the classroom. The the machine can also tell you if your being truthful about your emotions and identifies every muscle in your face. in the article it states ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This proves that if you want to find out if somone is lieing or not telling the truth you can find out by the machine. It all comes down to the machine and you will be very pleased by the results you get because the Facial Action Coding Sytem is very helpful. It will help a lot of people and it helps in a lot of ways. It is very valuable in a classroom and it helps students or other people find out some things that are helpful to them, thereofre it should be used in a classroom.","The author supports his idea by describing Venus in a very well way. In the text the author tell us about Venus and he tell us about how Venus could be, He also says that Venus could be just like Earth. Venus is the most dangerous planet because it has very high temperatures, is the hosttest planet but this p[lanet is important at the same time because is our planet sister. What this means is that Venus and Earth look alike but Venus a more Dangerous and it has differences too. One reason why Venus is dangerous is because is the hottest planet. In the firts paragraph the author says how bright Venus is, he says that is bright because is closets to the sun, and that it also has a nickname. In the text he says '' Venus sometimes called the ''Evening Star'', is one of the brightest points in the night sky.'' This shows us that he is telling how bright Venus is. The author also says that Venus is actually a planet. In the text it says '' In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun.'' This show us that Venus is a planet, and also how he descibe Venus. Another reason why on how the author describes Venus is that Venus looks just like Earth. In the second paragraph the author says ''Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionlly the closest in distance too.'' This show us how the author is comparing Venus to Earth and also how he describe Venus in a very well way. Venus is a danger because is the closest planets to the sun which means that is very hot and it can burned, and damage person very in a bad way or a person could die because of how hot is Venus. In the text the author says '' Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.'' This show us that Venus is a hard planet to study because of how hot it is the planet. In conclusion, Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide and it has clouds of corrosive acid in the atmosphere. In the text it says '' A trick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.'' This show the danger that is in Venus planet. Venus was a very high temperatures. In the text it says '' On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than what we experience on our own planets.'' This is show us that a human wouldn't be able to survive in Venus because of the high temperatures. If it 90 times greather then the temperature we experience in our planet then i cannot imagine a human, it would literally kill the person. Venus has the hottest surface of any other planet even tho the closest one to the sun is Mercury. Venusn is also our sister planet.   ","The idea of driverless cars sounds very fun, cool, and interesting, but I feel that this idea of driverless cars do not sound safe. My position on the idea of driverless cars that, I am against driverless cars only because, I feel that having driverless cars on the streets would be very dangerous with other drivers and pedesterians walking or driving across the streets. In paragraph 6 of the article, it states that having a driverless car means that the cars will drive themselves and, even with the antilock brake system, the passanger of the driverless car and pedestrianas would be in danger if the passanger in the car wouldn't be able to take control of the wheel as quickly and easily as if they had a car where they were allowed to drive on their own without taking control of the car from the car being in charge driving itself. So, what I mean by saying this, is that driverless cars are the not the safest things to consider. Driverless cars should not be allowed out on the streets because, first off it sounds very dangerous, secondly, it sounds like too much of a hassal to worry about getting all of the technology checked out everytime something doesn't work in the car. Lastly, the last reason why I think that driverless cars should not be allowed is because, the cars and all of the different technologies could potentially be very expensive in the end. To conclude my agrument on driverless cars, I do not think that driverless should be allowed out on the roads ever. I believe that driverless cars would always be a hassal trying to make sure you wouldn't hit anything or anybody while the car is driving and not you. I also feel that having a driverless car means that if your driverless car all of a sudden couldn't warn you about someone or something coming in your pathway and you do not see whatever or whoever is in your pathway, then you could potentially get in an accident and either severly injure,damage someones property, or even kill yourself and the person(s) you collided with. My last reason to conclude my essay is that, I believe that in the end, these so-called ""driverless"" caars will turn out to be very expensive to pay for, and keep getting all of technology checked out and made sure everything is functioning correctly, so you don't need to get more or new technology parts installed in your car. These my reasons why I think that driverless cars should not be allowed to be driven out on the open roads ever.   ","There were things in life that we didn't think we were going to enjoy, but after the influence of others opinions we tried it and loved it. Everybody has different perspective on things, sometimes hearing things from others can be helpful to make difficult decisions. When students,teachers,or even adults don't know what to do or they don't understand something, they ask for others advice because they need help. Everybody needs advice even if it hurts, sometimes hearing it from multiple people can be easier. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can keep you from making wrong decisions, it can help lead you to a road of success, and the variety of people that we know today wouldn't be were they are today without others opinions or advice. In life people are always going to make bad decisions including you, there are definitely times when everyone looks back and says "" I am so glad I didn't do this because my friends or my family members told me it would hurt me later on in life"". Sometimes people wish they could go back and listen to their friends or their parents who told them not to do something because it would effect them and they would have to live with it for the rest of their lives. Your friends and family are here for you, the advice they give to you it's not to just lecture you ,but to help you because they care. Hearing multiple opinions or advice from others are helpful because listening to different things makes you better as a person. life is never going to be easy it's baffling and complex, you are never going to make it in life if you don't seek help from others. Have you ever heard the saying if first you dont succeed try try again?. When you want to give up your friends and family are the first to tell you "" you can do this"" or ""dont give up"" because they want the best for you. I'm not going to lie at first usually when one person gives me advice telling me why I shouldn't give up I don't want to listen but when multiple people state their opinions or their giving me dive I start to listen because a variety of people are telling me I can do it. And when I try again I am successful, many people tend to be more successful when they are getting words of encouragement. Hearing a lot of positive advice puts you in a positive mindset, therefore giving a positive outcome. Many actors,singers,NFL players, and so much more are who they are today because of advice their parents,friends,teammates,etc. gave them when they were a child or even now. Their were people who voiced their opinion who weren't so kind and made that person even stronger as a person because they wanted to prove that they can . Many basketball players weren't always as good as they are or were now,like Kobe Bryant. Kobe is a legend and will always live in peoples heart, including his daughter but Kobe wasn't always good when he was a child, so he took everybody's opinions and advice on the court and became one of the most best players in history. His success is an inspiration to many people, Kobe gave a lot of advice to others. People are always going to be negative and voice their own opinions but its your job to take the ones that will make you better as a person. Many people will voice there opinions, listen to the good ones negativity will always be in this world. Your friends and family are here for you, they give you advice because they care. Hearing a lot of positive advice gives you a positive mindset and we need it a lot right now in this type of world. Many people that we know today are were they are now because of the advice the received. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can keep you from making wrong decisions, it can help lead you to a road of success, and the variety of people that we know today wouldn't be were they are today without others opinions or advice.",,,,,,,
397,923,"Dear Principle, In my own opinion i think that students should not be allowed to have cell phones at school at all. i think this for three reason's, first because kids will most of the time lie to their elders 'as in teachers' about turning of their self phone's during class, and end up using them and getting in trouble. Second reason is because kids will most likely text their friends during class and then, they'll be distracting them from learning and getting educated. And my final reason is because if the child gets their phone taken away, and they have to bring their parents into the problem witch wouldn't have to happen if their wasn't cell phones allowed in school. My first reason why i think that student shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school is because kids will most of the time lie to their elders 'as in teachers' about turning of their self phone's during class, and end up using them and getting in trouble. For example the child with the phone will most likely be using it during class, and that's pretty much wasting his/her time of getting educated. 'Which is the whole reason why students even wake up in the morning and walk or get driven to, too learn.' My second reason why i think this is because kids will most likely text their friends during class and then, they'll be distracting them from learning and getting educated. For example not only are they distracting them self's, but also other students to, who are trying to pay attention, and grow up with a good education so they can live a good life. And if that happiness, all their doing at school is wasting their time their doing nothing in class. My final reason why i think this is because if the child gets their phone taken away, and they have to bring their parents into the problem witch wouldn't have to happen if their wasn't cell phones allowed in school. For example during class your child gets their cell phone taken away, which makes a pretty big scene in class, which is distracting every one in class from learning. And if that isn't bad enough, your parents will be called to school to have a conference with the principle. And when your finally home, u get even in more trouble at home by your parents. 'which is not something a kid wants.' In conclusion i just told you my opinion on why kids shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school during class. First because kids will most of the time lie to their elders 'as in teachers' about turning of their self phone's during class, and end up using them and getting in trouble. Second because kids will most likely text their friends during class and then, they'll be distracting them from learning and getting educated. Finally because if the child gets their phone taken away, and they have to bring their parents into the problem witch wouldn't have to happen if their wasn't cell phones allowed in school.      ","To start off with, electing electors sounds a little bit redundant. Also, why do we vote for somebody that can vote in their own right as mentioned in article two provided to me? I say as a citizen of the United States that we should vote directly to determine the new president. If we vote for a representative of our state to elect our president, how can we be certain that he/she will vote as planned? The entire system is far from perfection, but can be fixed temporally. By changing the amount of votes to numbers that be added to equal the amount of representatives respectivly, it can provide an estamation of how many representatives from a state can elect a certain party. For example, if 4,000,000 people vote for republican and 16,000,000 vote democrat in a state with 10 representatives, 2 representatives will vote republican, 8 will vote democrat. However, if you do this, there will still be flaws in the system. The best way in my opinion of electing a presedent is to go ahead and let the people vote their opinion. Simple calculations to find percentages can determine the majority vote and elect the president/vice president, making things alot cheaper and more efficient. All by using a simple four-function calculator. To wrap things up, I will state that even though I am only part of the minority of the U.S., I am still a citizen stating his/her opinion towards a better future towards my homeland. Let's put the power back into the people, that way everybody's opinion, no matter rank, wealth, age, can/will count towards our next election in 2016.

Get to explore places you've never been to! Just take it from me, ""I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China"" That shows that you can see lots of places, but that isn't the best part! You also have a lot of free time on the way back from a trip. When we unloaded all of the animals, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helpes pass the time."" We enjoyed the rides back, but even that isn't the best part! The best part of being a Seagoing cowboy is helping people. When I became a Seagoing Cowboy, ""It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.

The software comes with alot of features but it could be a failure. Nobody could just guess someones emotions by looking at there face I dont think a computer sofware couldn't either. It possibly could find the emotions of someone but the results could be wrong because you never know what or how a person is feeling on the inside or outside. Most people don't express there feelings anyway so a computer sofware couldn't find it unless it has the best DNA sofware or best way to find how someones feeling on the inside. The Facial Action Coding System could be a failure in way of just having bad results if someones angry or depressed the software could determine that there happy or surprised. In the Mona Lisa picture she does look a little happy but thats one the inside it says it could find mixed emotions but she could be just smiling for the painting, Also in the instructions it gives you directions to smile or look happy. Maybe the software just tells your on the instructions to smile, so that the software could give you the results as your happy because of the directions of making you smile. The emotion software just gives you ways to smile maybe for you to smile so they can give you results as your happy or excited. In conclussion the Facial Action Coding System could be a failure and doesn't really work.","Although venus is referred to as the evening star, it is still a planet. Venus is one of the brightest planets and, you can easily see it on a dark knight. Researchers say thet venus is hard to examine because oh how bright it is and, how close it is to the sun. The author states than venus is the closest plant to earth because of the density and size of it. Many people say that it's the closest planet to us however, every planet spins around at a different speed so one might appear closer than another. NASA has sent several spacecrafts to venus and its referred to as the most difficult planet to land on. Every spacecraft that's ever landed there has never made it back due to the enviroment and, the rough surface. The author says that venus is almost all carbon dioxide and, its covered with corrosive sulfuric acid. He also states that venus is almost 800 degrees and, its extreme to what we experience on our own world. Venus is the hottest planet in solor system although, mercury is closer to the sun. Astronomers find venus so fascinating because it's the closest earth like planet in the solar system. Astronomers also say that venus could have well been filled with large oceans and, could have supported many forms of life. Venus is very similar to earth because, it has rock textures such as valleys, mountains, and craters as to earth. NASA is eager to go back to venus to study the earth like planet. The author says that they are planing to have an aircraft that will hover 30 miles over the surface that will make it safe. Allowing them to do this will lower the temperature to around 170 degrees, but also the air preasure would be about the same to sea level on earth. Although, hovering over venus would be safe, they would still find many challenges. Without them being on the ground they won't be able to take samples of rock, minerals, and gasses. NASA is wondering its they can make there equipment better to take on the challenge, and to see what venus is compared to earth. NASA will also have to come up with a way to make their equipment lighter, and also be able to last for the time period they are on venus. Modern technology is rather delicate than to the mechanical computers they used in world war 2. Although its a struggle to experience venus, it also has a big impact on earth. Being able to see what venus is allows us to find new materials and gases that we have never heard of before. This could be a big impact to us. It could help us find new ways to create materials, and to better our everyday lives. ","Drive or Driverless Driverless cars are just what the name states, cars without a need to have a driver present. This could be a big part of our futures but whether it will help our future drivers or hurt them is the main importance. Personallly I do not think that driverless cars are going to do more harm than good to our furture drivers. Today to get your drivers lisence you have to hold a permit for one-hundred eighty days and have to pass a writen test followed by a driving portion of the test with an instructor. These conditions you have to follow to be able to drive a normal car are intense because you are being put onto a road that could potientionally harm another humans life or your own life. The precautions you have to take are endless while driving and the risk you are putting yourself in is immense. Having driverless cars where you still have to be in control part of the time just causes an even bigger distraction especially for younger, newer drivers. You could be talking and suddenly have to stop manually and not have enough time to make it there, because you were distracted by something else. Another reason that driverless cars have a negative effect on the future is the economy. To make a normal car cost a lot of money but to make a driverless car would cost twice that or more because of the type of technology you would need to use to make them run proporley. Having normal cars puts your life into harms way and teens are bad enough when it comes to staying focused, being attentive,and staying cautious with normal cars. By putting teens behind the wheel of cars that uses a computer, or a controling device to run it, is teaching them nothing but pure laziness, not to focus your one hundred percent attention, and to stay alert when it comes to driving. Driving is a very serious matter that people already abuse laws and regulations for. To give people another excuse to why the accident happened or to why they wrecked into a pole should not come from our local car dealerships and manufacturers. We together as a community need to stop the driving problems directly and not give people more advanced technology, just so they have another excuse as to why an accident occured.   ","Do you ask for advice? Its a great thing to do. However,when asking for advice you may ask more the one person because they have different mindsets and some may have more experience then others. One reason you should ask different people people for advice is because people have different mindsets. Therefore,someone might tell you advice that can help you now but may not help in the future. Then someone else may tell you advice that may not work as much now as it will in the future. Another reason you may ask different people for advice is because some people people have more experience then others. For example ,if you ask someone your age for advice they are more likely to have a different answer the someone thirty years older then you. However,the thirty year old may have more experience in there life time then the person your age. Asking for advice from different people is a great thing to do. People have different mindsets and some people have more experience then others.              ",,,,,,,

All people deserve the same right. luke got injured and he had to rest for a couple days but he stil went on to finish the mission. He didn't even have an idea that his life was gonna change he just took the chance when it was offered and he never doubted it. After the war he joined the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Luke was only 18 when all of this happened. He helped out at his aunt Katie's ranch for most of his days when he was just a little boy. He helped with the enviorment and cattle and other animals at the places where ww2 took place. Alot of people died but not in his hands. Brave people survived and never forgot the memory of ww2. Luke being a Seagoing cowboy was the thing that he was most proud of. It opened up everything and everywhere to him that made him feel awesome for helping out arround the world instead of just watching other people take his opportunity.","As the school year approaches, students begin to turn their attention towards the daunting task of summer assignments. Teachers give assignments to their future students, whether it be books to read or projects to complete. These are designed to ensure that the students don't forget everything they learned in the previous year during summer. These summer projects should be student designed because students would be more motivated, students would know what they are doing more, and teachers could get an idea of what the student is like before the school year completely starts. It is not uncommon for students to not want to do a project that their teacher assigned them, and the fact that this project is during their precious summer break doesn't make it any better. A student might not try as hard on this assignment, or maybe even not do it, which defeats the purpose of a summer project. But if a student were to create their own assignment, that student would be much more motivated to complete the task. For example, if a teacher told their students to read a book and write a report on it, it likely wouldn't appeal to those who have to read the book. But if the student were to choose what project they wanted to do after reading the book, they could pick something they enjoy doing, and therefore the assignment would be much more productive. Before students meet their teacher at the beginning of the year, they are left with he inability to ask questions about the projects assigned to them over summer. This means that if the teachers give vague instructions, or the a student generally doesn't understand the assigned task, they best they can do is try to email their teacher and hope for a response. But, if a student picked their own project, they would definitely pick something that they know they understand and can do. For example, if a teacher tell their students to read a book and create a diorama, the students won't know what they need to create a diorama of. Now, a student given the same book but told to pick their own project would choose an activity based on the book that they know how to do, which would allow them to better complete the assignment. Summer projects are the first way a teacher gets to know what a student is like. If every one of the teacher's students is assigned the same exact project, they likely won't be able to tell much about the student. But, if a student is able to pick their own assignment, the teacher can begin to get an idea of how that student learns. For example, if the students are told to read a book but are allowed to choose their own projects, one student might choose to rewrite a scene of the book form a different perspective. This could tell the teacher that this student is a good reader and writer who understands the text they are given. Another student could choose to make a three dimensional model of something significant in the book, telling the teacher they are more creative and visual. This allows teachers to start to know their students. It goes without saying that the typical student wants to eliminate summer assignments altogether to have a responsibility-free summer, but a student-designed summer assignment is the next best thing. It allows the assignment to still get done, while letting students show thier teachers what they like to do, along with keeping them motivated and understanding the project.","Dear principle I think u should at least have a B average to go out and do any kind of sports because going out and having fun playing a sport is a privilege. If students had a C average there not rally learning anything and that mean u need to try a little harder if u want to do any kind of sports student need to have at least a B because they need to and if they don't then they shouldn't be in any kind of sport but i see if you a struggling in class then maybe but you should have the right. Right now I'm at a solid A to B average and i am very proud of that. Having an A average is awesome, having a B average yah your good but i think when your getting down to a C average, your just kind of getting lazy. That's my word, any way. Having good grades means every thing to me so it should matter to every one because school is important and you need it to get a good and worthy job. Sincerely STUDENT_NAME","i think that technology is valuable because you can tell when peoples expressions show they have a emotion like when their eyebrows go up their surprised or if their lips tighten up their angry so that's really cool because you can tell when their mad, sad,happy and thats how people can tell someone is having a bad day or just sad over something really bad so thats why i agree cause i always wanted to know what people are feeling. this evidence i got it from the article saying that thieir having technology where you can tell what people are feeling inside of them or if their mad at you or other stuff so its really cool that they invented this technology cause now people can see peoples emotions and we could never do that. the whole point of this article is about inventing a technology where everyone can tell what your emotions are and what your body expresses those are your emotions and thats how people know what your are expressing.","SHOULD PEOPLE DRIVE WITH THEIR CELLPHONE OR NOT? We all love our phones now a days and basically ever since they were invented. Everyone has one or wants one or the newest latest one .Ever since they were invented in 1700s people have taken the full advantage of the telephone presidents and war sargents used them to win battles and etc. Now the phone has evolved from tube looking phones to brick phones to flip phones to iphones and to smartphones. With all the new technology and apps like facetime snapchat3 games music social media there's almost no way anyone could ever put their phones down. But according to statistics in 2013 about 3,154 people died in accidents 424,000 were injured. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. So the question stands do we need to drive while on your cellphone? With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever. There putting almost smartphones in the car so you can most defiantly be distracted with that. The fact that they are and already are making cars able to drive by themselves is anther reason that is very distracting just as in Tulsa the electrically powered car has pilot mode so it drives itself. So many people have been distracted from the road and driving because the car can drive itself even though the car can drive itself you still need to pay attention to the road. I do understand that you don't need to be looking down when driving and I do understand that phones are distracting. So you picking up a cellphone and calling someone can be distracting. Also like I said in another essay I did there is a responsibility factor to firstly own a car and secondly to even own a phone. It might seem like it is not a responsibility owning a phone but it is when you own a phone you have personal information in it. If you were lose your phone and have never put a password or security code on it you can lose your information to whoever has your phone could be a hacker could be a random thieve. So really my answer is that it really depends on your responsibility level if you can't stay off your phone and it's life then you need to let someone drive but if you can be responsible while driving then I'd say you should us your phone responsibly. Cause if you drive irresponsibly you should have your phone.        ","What I think about classes online for kids who live far is that is not a good idea. It would distract tramandestly distract them from actully learn online. School should just upgrade transportation, and start school a little late. Some schools offer classes online, for those students who trouble far distances to attend school. In my opion I think schools should not offer classes online. Do to the cause that now a days, student would prefer to hangout with their friends at parties, games, sleepover, and more. Student wouldnt pay as much attention as if they were in school. Student from short distance would probably argue about wanting classes online too. Some students might even want to wake up later then usual. I've seen some students who skip school becuase they wake up late, and they live far away. Some get late to school. Student coming late to school, because they live far away. Schools should upgrade trasnportation instead of oferring classes online. Student from far away sometimes dont have any ride to school, therefore schools should invest in more capeable busses. The classes online would be fine for summer school. Since some kids fail classes during school year, they could retake the classes during summer, and the classes would be online. That is just my opion about having classes online for kids who live far. ","Driverless cars sound like everybody's fantacy, you see and hear about them from everywhere; fictional movies, childrens books, television, but having a driverless car might not be the fantacy you hoped for. There are many problems that come with the driverless cars. While you may be able to get around easily, who would be at fault if technology fails and someone is injured- The driver, or the manufacturer? Surely If you were to be in an accident because the car itself malfunctions causing injuries to you and other people you wouldn't be to blame? Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert human drivers. In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Why? Because it is rather dangerous. Another negative aspect would be that not everybody would agree with driverless cars, so would this cause a problem? Having normal cars and driverless cars on the streets together? Having a driverless car will cause issues with navigating through roadwork or accidents, because they might be programmed for certian roads with certain conditions. So if something were to happen such as an accident would the car know when to stop? Or if there was an ambulance coming down the road for an emergencey, would the car know to pull over and let it pass? Another con to the driverless cars would be that there would be so many sensors to go along with it. These types of cars need to have sensors in every direction, because there are unexpected animals, or children that cross the road without paying attention, they need to make sure the sensors are able to detect those types of things fast. Technology is going very far but not this far yet, we might be trying to rush it too much, having only driverless cars would pretty much mean getting rid of normal cars, therefore; Many car buisnesses go out of work and many people lose their jobs. That being said, it would be way to expensive to replace normal cars with driverless cars for the billions of people in the world. While there are many benefits to this idea of driverless cars there are just as many if not more cons.",,,,,,,
355,757,"I am Luke Bomberger and I have been to very unique places in my life time. Right now I work part time at two jobs in grocery store and at a bank. But what I didn't know that my life would change soon after I graduated. So thanks to my friend Don Reist he invited me ot go to Europe with him on a cattle boat. So of course I couldn't just say no because if I would have to be just carzy It was a life time opportunity. It was in the year of 1945, it was the time of World War II. So to help people recover, 44 nations joined to form a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So the next thing you know Don and I were signed up. In August 1945, we received our orders to go and report to the New Orleans. "" We arrived August 14 ,"" Luke said. Which was the day the that the Pacific War ended. They got their Seaman's paper and boarded up the SS Charles W. Woodster, headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses and plus enough hay to feed them all. Luke's birthday happened before arriving to Greece. He turned 18 which meant he could be drafted to military service. "" When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to justto keep doing that for my service."" But the trips we went on were unbelievable opportunities for a little small town boy like me. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the Eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for all the animalsand the crossingskept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bag of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on my aunt Katie's farm as a little boy helped me a lot to prepare me for this job. But not for the dangers on the seas that I had to face. On my second trip I was watch man for all the crews out on the boats. My job was to check all of the animals for every hour","The usage of summer projects is an undermined technique that schools implement to educate their students. It incorporates an application process to subjects and topics learned in class, to real-world settings. For many students, this process of application is enough to instill certain topics into one's memory. Thus, to ensure that students receive a meaningful and valuable summer project, teachers should have the ability to design and construct these assignments. The reason for this is that teachers effectively utilize summer projects to introduce new topics, have a better understanding of the curriculum and subject, and can emphasize certain topics that are vital for students to understand. Many students might find the first quarter of a new school year a bit cumbersome; however, with the aid of a teacher-designed summer project, students can establish a better academic foundation before entering the school year. This process of learning a topic before it is discussed or taught in school has may psychological and academic benefits. In the book Talent , the author describes the educational process as a learning curve; for our purposes, only the first and second stages in this process are critical to understanding the effects of teacher-designed projects. The first stage of this curve is the data gathering process, where a person begins to input and understand the information into one's conscious thinking: this is typically the longest and most difficult phase in the learning curve. The second stage of this curve is the application process, where people now have the ability to translate their newly acquired knowledge to a real scenario. A majority of students might not know this, but the first step in this learning curve is what students experience in a classroom, which is why students might not fully grasp a topic the first time it is taught. Connecting back to the prompt, the teacher-designed projects act as a catalyst to this learning process, where students aren't starting at the bottom of the data gathering curve, rather, they have already progressed through the first stage of learning. With a general foundation, students have a better ability to digest the information given during class. Moreover, this state of being a faster learner has many psychological benefits; the most important one being a confidence and morale boost. Essentially, feeling that you have this supernatural ability to easily absorb information boosts your confidence in the class, which, in return, increases your productivity in that class. A teacher-constructed summer project ensures that students can begin this learning strategy by introducing new topics that will be discussed during the following year. An important notion that should be addressed is that most students do not have a developed understanding of a subject's curriculum. However, teachers are trained and knowledgeable about the course curriculum, and have the ability to tailor the summer projects to the academic standards the students are expected to uphold. The issue with having a student-designed summer project is that the students might not have the ability to distinguish between topics that are less or more important. On the contrary, teachers posses the ability to guide their students to topics that are beneficial for them to understand. In other words, by allowing teachers to design the summer projects, students gain a better understanding to where the teacher is directing them throughout the new academic year. Despite the evidence listed, some students are still not satisfied with having a teacher-designed project during the summer. The major claims they use to corroborate their defense is that the projects designed by teachers are not interesting enough or they do not necessarily appeal to the students' interest. First, it should be noted that these are very sensible and valid reasons to why someone might not want a teacher-designed summer project. In fact, when people to do not enjoy a certain task, they loose motivation to complete it. However, it should also be noted that teachers consider this claim when designing their projects. Personally, I have always received flexible summer assignments from my teachers, where they have allowed students to add information and topics they find interesting to the overarching theme of the project. Teacher-designed summer projects have the ability to make space for topics that students might find interesting, while also directing them towards important topics and ideas that will be addressed in the following year. Like any logical argument, the good and harm of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects should be juxtaposed. For teacher-designed projects, there benefits include a smooth transition into new topics, outlining important topics and ideas, and a tailored focus to the curriculum. The only major disadvantage to teacher-designed summer projects are that it might not be interesting for the student, which is not always the case. On the contrary, student-designed projects have the benefit of being interesting to the desires of the students themselves. However, student-designed summer projects have many disadvantages including a less reliable topic focus and a meandering project objective. Furthermore, it is evident that teacher-designed summer projects are more beneficial to the students than student-designed summer projects are. ",I believe that this is a good policy that you must have at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities. I think this is a good policy because for some people high school is difficult enough when your not busy and all those programs can distract you from doing good in school. Sports can be distracting because instead of studying for a test you might have to go to practice or go to a game. Another reason why this is a good policy is because in sports you don't always make it on a college team or a pro team and then you have to get a regular job. If you didn't get good grades in high school then you it's harder for you to find a job in this job market. Companies would much rather hire a person that got a B or A average than a person that got a C or D average who played sports in high school. That's just how it works just because it's much more of a struggle to find a job now than in the twentieth century. Also this is a good idea because it could set an example for some younger athletes that want to continue to play sports that they have to keep their grades up in order to play. If they didn't decide to use this policy then some people might not even try to get good grades and just worry about sports. There's one thing bad about the policy though. I believe that they should wait a while before they pass this policy to give some students sometime to learn some healthier studying methods. If they pass it in the middle of the school year most students will not have enough time to make the change. Overall i think that this policy is good and won't be surprised if it does get passed considering how so many politicians are raising issues of how the nation's kids are learning            ,"Leonardo Da Vinci's renaissance painting ""Mona Lisa"" is one of the famous painting this world has ever known. But there was one question in my mind,""WHAT IS HER EMOTION""? Is she smiling, is she angry, is she sad, what is her emotion. Now this new technology called FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) can measure human emotions. It also measures Mona Lisa's emotion. Is it valuable in today's world. Nowdays, unlimited machines have been built to comfort human civilization. Some of them really benefitted, some of not. Now a Human emotion telling machine is built to measure emotions. I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, ""IT IS USELESS"". WHY?.Let me explain you. Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days. I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make. Useless because it has no role to deal with human stress, it reads emotions, that's pretty cool. But what anout dealing with stress. I hope you like my thought.   ","Phones And Driving We all know how it feels to be driving and receiving text from friends and or family. Its very hard to say no to yourself after you see the notification. A lot of people just tell themselves ""just real quick"" or ""just this one time"". Everyone knows that texting and driving is a bad idea but nobody knows exactly why. About 90 percent of car crashes are not due to drunk drivers or people who are speeding. But they are due to drivers like me and you who think they can do two things at once. Answering these text messages takes a lot of attention off the road. As humans we can only multitask in a couple ways and they aren't that good. Texting and driving causes you lose awareness of what's around you. People crash most cause they don't see oncoming vehicles or they don't see certain things from a distance. Keeping your eyes off the road can be the difference between life or death in a car crash. It all comes down to how fast you were going and your reflexes. driving doesn't feel dangerous. We may recognize on a cognitive level that distracted driving is stupid, but we have no accompanying visceral feeling of fear, no associated emotion to guide our decision-making in the moment of temptation. Our brains do such a good job making us feel like we're in charge that we don't realize it's all an illusion until it's too late. If our hearts started racing as soon as our attention started to drift, we might be more inclined to stay focused. we feel immune to the risks that affect other people. Researchers who study texting while driving find that their participants ""have observed others driving erratically while using a cell phone, but these participants rarely, if ever, thought that their own driving was impaired when they used the cell phone."" And despite the fact that there is no benefit to practice (people who regularly use their cell phone while driving perform no better in studies than those with less real-life experience), the belief that we can manage persists. Consistent with this, three out of four people think they are above average drivers (a statistical impossibility). We are simply overconfident in our abilities.   ","Some students need alternatives for learning and schools should be liable to provide them. Whether it's a class or just school in general, students should have options based on whichever way they learn the best. Some students just want to take online so they can use their resources while doing their work, others like it because it's the environment they are able to learn in the most efficiently in. In my opinion, it doesn't matter what reason they have to take the class. All that matters is the student is getting a better grade and learning more than the environment he or she was in. Of course they're people who need to be in a different environment because of medical or mental reasons; But this doesn't mean we shouldn't provide it for those who are struggling in a classroom environment. Honestly I find this prompt ironic because this year is the first time i've taken an online class and i've been asked, ""isn't that for kids with special needs?"" ,and I find myself saying exactly what I wrote in the first paragraph! Since I am taking an online class I can safely say that it has helped me. The reason I took my class online (History) is because the classroom I was in was very hectic. I am in honors and that is one of the only honors classes I am taking so I didn't want the reason for me dropping out of honors to be my teacher/class, and that's when I thought about online class. Instead of dropping the class I was able to still take honors online and my grade went from a C to an A. On top of that, I have more fun being in this class so it makes me wanna learn. I truly believe that I can learn more in a week of online class than I would a year of History with Generic_Name. It's not that he's a bad teacher, once again, it's just that environment isn't for me. I believe that schools should feel obligated to provide an alternative for student's education. In my opinion, the evidence speaks for itself. Would you rather spend a year wasting your time in a class that you might fail because it isn't the way you learn, or would you rather spend 8 months in a class that you'll have fun in and retain the information for the rest of your life? Duh, the one you'll do bad in.(sarcasm) Schools already provide alternatives for a lot of kids, but mostly for people who need it (medical reasons). But that doesn't mean the students who are struggling in ordinary environments don't ""need"" it too. I didn't know how to indent so I used spaces.","Google driverless cars are something of the future right? Not anymore the company Google are and did make cars that are driverless in some aspect. They still need human control in certan situations like in passage 7 stating some accidents and work zones human interaction with the mobile vehicle is needed. In a way its much sophicated than human driving more precise as you will. In this case it would be alot more safer for us and the enviorment as they say in passage 1 saying that the cars would use half the gas we use today. Theres more pros than cons in this invention and it would be a great accomplishment to creat a car with these abilities. Google cars are here not yet purchasable , but they are made and tested. With this long period of time they should create the best saftey precautions in the vehicle itself. With these new features im sure that they would bring in high saftey precaution in these vehicles because this is a new era of mobile vehicles. The fact there would be less accidents and fewer human fault accidents. There would be less tickets and fewer police officers running around pulling people over. If they make this car how i am thinking they will they could change everything about the art of driving. Less gas more money thats what we all want. More money thats what youll have after Google release these driverless cars. The bonus will be a healthier enviorment. Half the gas half the polution. The enviorment is severly important to us. The air we breath, the food we eat, the pure decorations, the way we live is based on this huge factor of the enviorment the more healthier it is the better we live. With this car great things will happen outside and inside our wallets. Based on these facts in the article theres a definate change becoming afloat the way we live will change for a long time. We get alot of improvements when they release this driverless car the rules will change for the better. We will see our family members safer with these automibles on the market.

355,923,"The reason that people should join the Seagoing cowboy program is it saves animals over in Europe. They shiped horses, young cows, and mules overseas. They would take care of the animals as they where being shiped so Luke and Don sighned up. They got their with 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them all. They hade a long trip their they got there on August 14 1945. It was the day the Pacific war had ended. Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece so he could be drafted for military service. In the text it states that when the draft borad hade learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to keep doimg that, he made 9 trips. So it was long but it sounds fun to me and they did good for the world by helping other people. So if I coud I would. It's also the right thing to do. After this would you do it?","Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during thier break. Do you think that these summer projects should be student-designed or teacher- designed? Many people feel that it should be student-designed and others feel it should be teacher-designed. In my opinion, Students should design the summer projects that they have to do. First of all, The projects should be student-designed because they can make it fun and it would give them more of a desire to actually do the project. The students can make it more fun because they know what the enjoy doing over summer or what they would be able to make fun. They would have more of a desire to do it because they made it and because it would be fun and not completely complicated. For example, Generic_Name and her classmates had to do a summer project and their teachers designed the project. Generic_Name and her friends didnt do the project because whenever they got ready to do it together a couple of them got bored with it because it was not fun and the other students did not complete it because it was too complicated for them to do. That is one reason as to why I believe that students should design their own summer projects. Secondly, If a student designs their own summer projects they will more than likely do a better job on it. Students are just like everyone else and they do a better job on something they made up themselves. Students like to do their own things and if a teacher desnigned the project they would not be able to enjoy it and do a better job on it. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name gave have her class a specific summer project they had to do and she allowed the other half of her class to choose what they would like to do for a project. They students that did not get to choose their project either did not do it or did not get that well of a grade on it because they were not at all interested in it. However, the students that did get to choose thier projects did complete it and they all did very well on it. That is way in my opinion, teadcher should not design the summer projects for students, but students should design the projects themselves. On the other hand, If teachers designed the summer projects they would have more indepth questions and work to do that would get students brains thinking and learning. Teacher also know all of the critearia that has to be followed. Teachers are able to make projects fun and enjoyable as well as give the students a little stuggle with the work so they would actually be learning instead of just flying right through the project. I do still believe that students should design their own projects. In conclusion, my opinion is that students should design their own summer projects because they know what they like for fun things and they would do a better job on their project if they designed it. I do see how it would benifit if teachers designed it however students would still do a better job on it and have more fun and do it on time if they designed the summer project themselves. What is you opinion on this topic?","Dear, TEACHER_NAME This is a serious cause to many people but for some reason many of those students have a grade C average but you must have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. In this reasonable letter I will be supporting my argument with specific reasons. Feel welcome to not accept my reasonings but i assure you that it will be better to let C students be eligible for playing sports. My number top one reason is that the school will lose popularity do to the fact that students will transfer out to another school in search of a school that accept C students in sports and other activities. The school will lose money but not that much but yeah they will have no more basketball games or any other sport that requires an entrance fee. So I really think that you should consider the policy before you make it official. Another reason to let these students get in sports is that a C is a passing criteria grade point average score. Another reason is that it will help the students out of gang and drug participation, instead they would be in school training or participating in a school activity. So please TEACHER_NAME help the school by accepting C students into sports. It would save you a lot of F students and trouble with the school. You will also be helping out a family in accepting his/or her child into a free sport team instead of struggling to pay a out side of school team which would cost alot of cheddar. I hope this essay has changed your mind, good day to you sir and thank you for taking time to read this.","Even though different technology can do many things, reading emotional expressions using technology can be valuable. It is valuable because this kind of technology can seek if your happy, sad, excited, surprised, etc. Many people don't express their emotions the same way. This technology we're talking about is called the Facial Acting Coding System and it enables humans emotions. This technology is however valuable because it can clarify how others are feeling even if they're hiding their emotions. It can also let someone know which emotion your showing because sometimes diiferent emotions can be showed with the same facial expression. When showing expressions, many of your muscles are being used. Computers can recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel by constructing 3-D computer model of the face and the 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" When you show any type of facial expression, your using at least one or more muscles. This is called action ","Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all behind a wheel. Today's technology has become a big impact on everyone life. The most used technology of them all is the cell phone. This device has any and everyone hypnotized which makes it very dangerous. Cellphones is a deadly device to me personally because people that on our cellphones do not pay attention to what goes on around them. That's why it's important for us to not have them while driving. Studies have shown that at least 6% of accidents have been caused by somebody using a cellphone. It seems that not only are drinking and driving dangerous, but using a cellphone behind the wheel is very dangerous. People in this generation believe that it's always dangerous if you text and drive. Just being on your phone period can be a dangerous situation for anybody, not just you. People believe that since you are not texting on the phone that it should be okay to be on the phone, I believe you shouldn't be on it period! If we put our phones up and pay attention, a lot of accidents could prevent. We could have saved many lives. Cellphones are a huge distraction believe it or not, especially in today's society. It seems that the cellphone has become everyone's priority. That's why we cannot put them down for more than five minutes. Even talking on your phone is worse than texting, but texting is what people talk about the most. We should be talking about people being on their phones period .Just being on your phone can be more dangerous than anything. See, driving a vehicle is already dangerous enough because you can easily end your or someone else's life. You need all of your attention on the road and what's going on around, so you can be aware. A cellphone will take your attention away from most of things around you. Texting while driving can take away from reaction time. If you're on your phone, it will give less time to react to a situation. In conclusion, I believe drivers should not be allowed to drive while they are on a cellphone. Cellphone are a huge distraction and with this distraction people can be injured or killed from using their phone. Instead of talking about texting while driving we should talk about us not using a cellular device at all when you're behind a wheel. We should try to enforce it more so people's lives can be save, and people don't have to get injured.   ","Did any of the schools you attended as a child offer distance learning? Would you be interested in participating in distance learning? Schools are now offering distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools believe that there are benefits to distance learning, however there are various problems with the system of distance learning. Distance learning is not beneficial for students because it will not prepare them for the set up of college, they are not going to be able to interact or learn how to work with their peers, and they are more likely to get easily distracted when learning from home. One way that distance learning would not be beneficial for students is because it will not prepare them for the set up of college. In almost all colleges, the classes offered are in large lecture halls where you are face to face with the teacher and other students, and not separated by a screen. By participating in distance learning students may not be prepared for face to face interaction with their teacher and the other students. For example, my brother, who is now a senior in college, participated in a system similar to distance learning while he was in school. After having participated in online and video conferencing classes for almost all of his school career, he had a much harder time adjusting to the college style of teaching than the other students, from his same high school, that did not participate in distance learning. Another way that distance learning would not help students prepare for the set up of college is that the students that participate in distance learning will have trouble adjusting to having to leave their house to attend class. In college classes are not offered inside of dorms and students will have to travel outside of their living area. If students do not practice taking classes outside of their home in high school they may feel uncomfortable learning in an unfamiliar environment and that could affect their learning abilities when they get to college. Another downside to the distance learning system is that students would not have daily interaction or learn how to work with their peers. In school you meet many new people from around your town that may have very different cultural or ethnic backgrounds. If students were to participate in distance learning, although they would meet various other peers through activities like sports, clubs, or their hobbies, they would not meet as many people as they would if they were also in a classroom with twenty to thirty other kids. Because of this limited interaction with other kids their age, these students who participate in distance learning may not learn how to interact and collaborate with other students. For example, my brother had a difficult time making friends in college because he had little experience interacting with other children that he didn't already know and have a relationship with. He also struggled in group projects because he had not participated in one since elementary school, when he began distance learning. Not learning how to collaborate with others can be detrimental for a student because that will be a major part of their lives after they finish school. Whether they use the skill of interacting with other people in their future job, or even just to make to new friends after moving to a new town, the skill of interacting with others is very valuable and important to possess. The final reason that distance learning is not beneficial to students is because it allows students to become more easily distracted. In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade. Distance learning is not beneficial to students because it does not prepare them for the set up of college, they would not be able to learn how to interact and collaborate with their peers, and they are more likely to be easily distracted when learning from home. Although distance learning may provide some benefits to learners who may struggle with learning in a classroom setting, it will ultimately affect them in a negative way in the future. ","Are driverless cars going to use half the fuel we use today? Are these cars safe for travel? The dirverless car is said to fundamentally change the world. The first driverless care was created by Google in 2009. This car has traveled over a million miles to different places with no crashes. Even though the car is called ""driverless"" it techniqually is not. The driver would still have to take control of the car when traveling through traffic, passing an accident, or traveling through road work. Even though the driverless car has sensors, anitlock breaks, and driver assistance is it safe? My position on the driverless car is undecided. I believe that this car has outstanding safety features but it also has some down falls. The outstanding features that this car has include getting the drivers attention if need and driving assistance found in the car. The car is to get the drivers attention if the road ahead requires human skills. For example the drivers seat can vibrate or flashing lights found on the windshield can aleart the driver that they need to take control of the car. The down falls of this car to me would be the ability to not be able to see something aorund the car. The driverless car has many sensors, which is good until they break. If one breaks and the driver does not know then the car could wreck and hurt others or the driver. Also another down fall is the cost of the car. If something breaks on the car the price of that part will be very expensive. I for see only people with higher incomes having these cars. If I decided to be for the car I would like all of the safety features found on the car. I would feel safe while traveling in this car because of the features. The driverless car would be a good family car and would also help save money. By saving money this could allow a family to do other things with each other instead of using it on a car. I think the driverless car is a great idea for the new generation but I feel that the older generations will turn this car down due to unkown facts about the new car. If I decided to be against the car I would have an unsafe feeling about the car. The dirverless car has many sensors and safety features but what happens when those break while driving. If they break while driving will the car wreck? Will it aleart the driver? How do you know when a sensor has gone out? All of these questions are left unanswered. This car could be a huge distraction to the driver and other people around that car. This could cause accidents, death, and severly injure people. I would rather be in a car where I am in control and I don't have to worry about my car taking care of me. The driverless cars created today have magnificent safety features but are they safe? The cars safety features include sensors, antilock breaks, and drivers assistance. The first car was made by Google in 2009 and has traveled many miles without a crash. I believe that there is good things about this car and bad things. A good thing about this car is all the new technological safety features put in this car to keep everyone in the car safe and everyone around the car safe. A bad thing about this car is what happens when the sensors break. Does the car tell you? Are you suposed to check before you get in the car? Do the sensors even break? There are many questions left unanswered to me and that makes me be against this car being allowed on the road. ",,,,,,,
755,494,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, some students have a c grade average and are on many of the sports hear at school some work very hard for that c because school is guest to hard for them. i bet if it was there choice they would have a A or a B. But not everyone has the same brain so school will be difficult for some student than others. But me personally if i was the principal i would let any chilod play with a C or higher average because god made us all different and were not all as smart as our classmates. some parts of school are harder than other for example algebra is a heck of alought harder than hope or technology. So in my perspective of this hole thing is you are takeing it way to far if you only let kids play on teams hear at SCHOOL_NAME it would be like totally deleting the basketball team because most of them have barley the grade they need to pass but if you think that is the correct decision that is fine by me because your the principal and im not playing any sports. Cutting back on sports and raising the grade point average is causeing obesity in teens all across America would you really want to be hated by over half the schools population. HINT HINT i sure wouldn't want to be hated by over half the schools population !!! but if that's your choice and you rely wanna be the worst principle ever than that's fine by me because like i said its not my decision to be the most hated principle in the hole universe and it doesn't affect me what so ever because my lowest grade is a B and im happy at that besides the kids on the team can guest go play rec or come to my house i gotta basket ball hoop. sincerely, your most greatest student in the population of SCHOOL_NAME STUDENT_NAME","Advice is needed a lot in life, and when it is needed seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful. Seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful for making a better choice because it gives more overall information and more points of view. when you ask only one person you only receive one point of view and much less information overall, which in the end may be faster but it is less helpful when you need advice. When you get advice from multiple people it gives you multiple points of views. This is very helpful because it gives different ways to think, and it can also change your mind about what advice you are looking for. When you speak to multiple people it puts you in other peoples shoes and hearing advice from multiple people can make you feel different about the advice your looking for. you could be researching and be stuck to one point of view, but after hearing multiple people, your opinion could completely change. Another reason to ask more people when looking for advice is there will be more overall information gathered. When you talk with multiple people it helps you understand what you are looking for because you hear more information which helps greatly when you need advice. Looking to multiple people for advice is also helpful just because it will let you know more about what you are looking for, or it will just let you understand what your looking to find better. talking to multiple people is very helpful when you are looking for advice, because you get more points of view and you get more overall information for advice. There is very little reason to only look to one person for advice when you can look to a few, because with one person you get less information and only one point of view, but with multiple you learn what multiple people believe and you get much more information which will help you much more in the long term. advice is something needed lots in life, but this is why you should ask multiple people when looking for advice.","As technology advances, humans find themselves wondering whether it is helpful or if it hinders humanity. According to Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, computer software is now able to detect emotions in facial expressions. Although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in the classroom. Dr. Huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. It would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). However, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. Also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. School prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. Placing a Facial Action Coding System in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently. In paragraph two Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" I strongly disagree with this statement. Being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. If we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. The beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. Taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life. Just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. By adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. They would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. Finally, the need for human interaction is constant. Humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. This open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people. Without it, humans would not be able to enjoy life.","Do you like online classes or going to school? I think going to school is the better option because if you take online classes you cant ask questions,dont get the full experience of class,and you also dont meet new friends and people. Going to school and being present has very many advantages. When you are in school you are able to be with the teacher. It is easier to ask questions so they can demonstrate or answer and explain it to you. I feel it is easier to understand if you are shown and told verbally instead of through email or text. It is much harder to ask questions if you are doing it through a computer. It is easier for the teachers to be able to help you in person and not try to explain it through a screen. Being in school has a much better advantages than online does. If you are online you do not get the full experiences as you do with going to school. You cant join clubs,go to fun pep rallies, or even go on field trips. Going to school may seem boring and useless but it gives you experience, especially with adult figures. Online classes dont offer sports so if you wanted to join a sport you cant through a computer, unless you are playing online. Once you get out of school you will miss it. It is a great time to explore who you are and who you want to be. Finally if you dont go to school you will not make new friends. It is hard to make new friends and meet new people through a computer. It is so much fun making friends in a school full of one thousand people. It is great to be in school and have friends in your classes. School is like a pool full of new and mysterious people. It is good to have teachers by your side for help. Friends are a really good support system. If you are home and something happens it is good to go to school and talk to your friends about it instead of staying home and keeping it in. Friends help with a lot that you need. I get that home school is fun but it isnt always the best choice. Online classes may sound so cool, you can just stay in your pajamas all day long and do your work but is staying home all the time really that fun. Dont you just want to get out there and have somewhere to be. Online classes may still be a good option for some people but for most being at school is a great thing. School is just a better option in all. Home school isnt so fun when something happens at home and you have nobody to talk to or nowhere to go. Going to school is still the best option because you cant make friends,you dont get the full experience, and you cant ask teachers questions one on one. Going to school is a really good opportunity for everyone to find out who you are. School is a fun and enjoying place, it has so many opportunities you would never get doing online classes.","In Source 1 Elizabeth Rosenthal gives information on Germany's car-free cities and shows her support of the idea. I belive that a car-free day as shown in Source 2 in Paris is a good idea for two reasons. First, a single day of no use of automobiles can be extremely beneficial to the ecosystem. Second, it is shown tobe less stressful and safer to those who participate in the event. The benefits of a car-free day far outweigh the slight inconvenience that it may bring. In the event in paris they had a 60 percent decrease in traffic congestion and before the car-free day paris had 147 micrograms of pollution in the air and after the car-free day it had a measley 79.9 microgram count, thats impressive. not to mention this is only a 24-hour event everyone can sacrifice that ammount of time for a great cause like this. Secondly, there are several records of people claiming that they feel less stressed like citizen of Vauban, Germany, like Hiedrun Walter. No automobiles means no traffic, no loud horns or loud engines in the middle of the street. Plus, you will be able to enjoy exercise and taking a train or Taxi to you're destination which allows for a more public and social experience for those who participate, and not to mention you could be fined if you dont participate. In conclusion, I feel that it is highly beneficial to the ecosystem to limmit car usage even if only for a day. It's a slight sacrifice for a potentialy huge gain. It can also prove to cause less stress than every day transportation that were used to.    ","Dear Principle , I think all students should be required to take community service. Reason being , I think students should have some type of experience in helping our community out. Not only the community but to help the planet out as well. It would help most students who are teens. Because it will most likely keep them out of trouble during there time helping out. It can help them stay on track in school, keep up their grades. And have extra credit. Also help keep them from being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also think it will be a nice experience for those who want to help out. It could also be a fun learning program by having the students learn about their environment and their surroundings. Having students do community service will be a great way of helping save some animal. Animals? You may think. Well yeah animals too. In their own special way. It would help keep all kinds of animals from putting things in their mouths, and help them by decreasing the death rate and health problems that are in the air. I strongly suggest this program. It would also be a nice was of making our school look nice. Not just from the outside but from the inside as well. There for I think you should have all students do some kind of community service to help out. And it can help put more knowledge. Students doing community service might also have an impact on the younger kids by wanting to help keep the environment clean and safe for all people. I strongly recommend this program. I hope this may help change your mind. Thanks for your time and support in having to read my letter. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Students take their summer break to relax and have fun, but others will have a few projects to complete before school starts again. Many schools in the country will require students to complete summer projects, they want to ensure that students are still learning over break. I believe that these summer projects should be student designed because it allows them to be creative, they can pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like. Having students design their projects will allow them to be creative, many students would not enjoy the project as much if the teacher has a set design on how the project will be. Students would not be eager to do it and delay the assignment waiting till last minute to start it; allowing them to have full creative ability will produce incredible work. Students can express artistic ability with their work allowing them to draw pictures, use different mediums, lavish colors, and think of creative designs. Just giving them that freedom could make the assignment exciting instead of feeling like a chore they are forced to do. Students can pick topics they are interested in allowing them to enjoy the project. If the teacher assigns a topic students are not interested in, it would not be an enjoyable time. The students would not be motivated to do research on the topic, they would push off on the assignment, and be completely unaware of important facts in their topic. By allowing them to chose any topic it would make learning fun, a student can be fascinated by a topic but never had the opportunity to thoroughly research it and this would be the chance. The research they would do may mean a lot to them, it could be a future occupation they want to be helping them learn the requirements needed for specific facilities, schools, and how much money they would make. It could also allow for students to be informed on a topic they do not know much about and would like to be knowledgeable in a certain field. Having students chose would be an incredible opportunity to learn. Lastly, students are able to do the projects how they would like to do it. Having the teacher decide how the project will be set up may be underwhelming for students or difficult to set up. By allowing them to chose how to do their project will result in creative ideas and make the project less difficult. Some students may want to do something else than a regular PowerPoint, they could make a book filled with all the information needed and they can draw pictures. Maybe they want to do videography, they could film a music video or a short film with a script and actors. Also by allowing them to chose it could create less pressure for the students, there are many sites that have layouts and videos guiding them with their project. If they are not able to do it how the teacher wants it they cannot ask them for help they are over break and could not have the teacher's contact information. The summer projects are a great way to assure students are still learning over break but allowing the students to design their projects would be an incredible opportunity for them to be creative, pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like. I believe this would be a good opportunity for schools and students to keep learning even over their break and encourage them to always be knowledgeable                                      ",,,,,,,
755,757,"Keeping a B average is not as easy as it seems. Just a couple bad assignments can throw you down to a C, and its hard to put all your time and effort into schoolwork if you do sports. This is why students should not have to keep a B average to do sports. In order to keep a B average, students would have to put all their time and effort into their schoolwork, which is hard to do if you spend three hours a day doing a school sport. Here's what RELATIVE_NAME school day looks like. RELATIVE_NAME gets out of school at 3:00, and goes right to football practice. RELATIVE_NAME practices until 6:00, and rides a bus home, which takes 30 minutes. RELATIVE_NAME gets home at 6:30, and does his chores until dinner at 7:00. When he finishes dinner he quickly finishes the nightly homework, because if he put any time into finishing it, he would be in bed by midnight, and would only get 6 hours of sleep. Some of RELATIVE_NAME's friends are in band and football, and have to practice their instruments for 30 minutes each day, along with chores, and 5 periods worth of homework. Also, C average is a passing grade, for some people, passing is hard enough, so to make them go above the level of expectation, is a lot to ask. For people like me, it is not hard to get an A or B, but for people with a lot less time on their hands it can be very difficult. I used to play school volleyball, and I was having a lot of problems keeping my grades up, so I decided to quit, in order to keep my grades up. For many people, keeping a B average would not let people get nearly enough sleep to stay awake during their classes, and it is unreasonable to make them have a grade above passing if they participate in a school sport. Unless you want sleeping students in your classroom, and many upset students, don't make them keep a B average.","Have you ever struggled and needed help? What did you do to fix your problem? Asking your friends is a good option but a lot of times it's not good enough to just ask one person. When seeking out for advice, it is beneficial to talk to more than one person because it eliminates or decreases bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the most effective option to fit your own needs. Many people have their own ways to solve certain problems and therefore have their own opinions on how to solve the task at hand. When you ask more than one person for advice, you can see what has worked for certain people and apply the different strategies to your own problem. Everyone needs some advice including players in the National Hockey League or in any other professional sport. Athletes always get advice from many coaches and each coach has their own style. Athletes then use the advice to see what is most beneficial. Asking for more than one person for advice won't guarantee that your problem will be solved, but the probability of success if substantially higher because you have other people's experiences to get you closer to your solution. On my hockey team I am currently assistant captain and sometime my teammates come to me for help. For example, one of my teammates asks me what he needs to do when he below the goal line. I always give him my opinion, but i always suggest that he also asks for another opinion. Because we are not the same, my strategies won't necessarily work for him. When we start playing our games, he can try out the different strategies and see what is most effective. Now he is able to adjust and use the most effective solution to get his way out of the problem Lastly, Asking multiple people is great because you can find the most effective option. I applied to three private schools and you had to write an essay for all three schools. When I was down at Texas, I was proof-reading one of my essays and was getting ready to turn it in. My mom and I were already proofreading but we chose to get multiple opinions on my essay. We ended up getting my aunt and my older cousin to help produce the best final copy of my essay. We were all collaborating and talking to make sure we all agreed on the errors and the best way to fix each problem. Even though I had my own ways of fixing it, it was not the most clear and concise way. The final product ended up very good and I ended up getting in to all three of the schools. This showed that getting multiple opinions on a certain task can lead to the best product or solution. Getting multiple opinions is helpful because it eliminates or decreases bias leading to a overall better product or solution. Even professionals such as book authors need people to constantly check over their work and to give them feed back on their stories. Everyone needs help here or there along their lives, but all you have to do is ask. Getting multiple opinions will help eliminate or decrease bias, you get multiple opinions from different perspectives, and you can find the best most effective option.",I would argue yes this could be a valueable. The reason this could be valueable is because this can be used anyhwhere in classrooms work offices police office etc. People wouldn't be able to lie about what they done or how they feel inside. This could become a lie test for people who comit crimes. I believe this new technology could become a great tool. The teachers when they ask a student if he/she understand their face tell it all. This can also help teacher who at times don't know how a student feels and relate with the student. If the students aren't into a lesson the teacher know so she maybe come in at a different point of veiw. This would not only be a good tool but it could make people better at their jobs. This new technology can be use in the court. When people lie they put on a different face with the kind of tool the courts can detect if someone telling a lie. This new technology tool can make jobs like easier and take stress off people knowing that they did the right thing. This can also tell if someone gets mad and about to lose control which can also be a sign of guilt. This new technology tool can be of great use in the at docter office or the emergancy room. This tool can help se how much pain a person is really in and what they can do to help. This can also see if someone is liying about pain to get pills to sale. This can also see if someone needs help mentally and what can help or be of great use to them. This new technology can help after a women has given brith to see if the baby is doing well. I think this new technology tool can be of great use to our society. This technology open doors to a better life a better school for kids. This technology can be useful because it helps people see the things wrong about them. This technology can be used anywhere helps peole who needs help this can also help people descirbe how they feel in the inside. I do believe that this invention would have a great use in society and benefit many people in the work force.       ,"In society, students can learn in many different environments and on many different platforms. People can learn in places such as school, while traveling, or at home. Although many claim that learning at home would help students grow as individuals because they have more freedom, students would not benefit from attending classes at home because there would be a lack of social experience, people's days would be less structured, and there would be more distractions. To begin with, without school there is a strong lack of social encounters with others. School can be a fantastic way to make friendships, and learn at the same time. For example, a student could be struggling with the information to know for a test. With the help of another student, they could both learn the material and create a bond of friendship that could last a lifetime. However, if a student were to take online classes or video conferencing they would not step out of their comfort zones to meet other people. Without seeing others everyday, students would start to feel very lonely. Therefore, grades would drop because of the feeling of discouragement in their social lives. When students stay at home and do not see fellow students, their days would become long and tedious. In addition, when students do not have school, their days are less structured. Without certain times for classes and school, there would be less focus for academics. An example of this is if a student were doing online school and decides to sleep in every morning. When they wake up later every weekday, they would have less time for schoolwork. This would cause laziness and stress due to the change in time and schedule. Also, with online school there is no school sponsored extracurricular activities to structure people's days. When students have activities to attend to after school, they are motivated to get their work done and are excited throughout the day. Without an activity, the students will believe they have more time and accidentally overlook the online schoolwork. When the pupils are busier, they are forced to block their time to get work done and are more focused. Therefore, when learning at home students would be more distracted. While learning with video conferencing or online school, students have the options of TV, books, movies, and access to phones. These would distract from learning, and potentially cause cheating because no one is watching the students to make sure they are following an honor code. For example, a student could be learning online and takes a break because they are bored of working. A five minute break can turn into an hour and prevent learning with no teachers to watch over the student. However, if a student was learning at school they would have less of the distracting luxuries that we use at home. With proctors and teachers that want the best for the students, when using traditional methods for learning the pupils grow as individuals. In conclusion, students would not benefit from learning at home because they will be less socially advanced in society, there would be less structure of the pupil's days, and the students would be distracted from their schoolwork. When online seminars and classes become a part of a child's day to day life, society will advance less over time. However, if people continue to send their children to schools, the new adults will have social skills, academic intelligence, and will be fantastic additions to the world.","Well for one if we limit car usage, gas wouldn't pollute the air as much and make Earth a much better planet. I think it would be much better to limit the use of cars because then there wont be as much deaths due to accidents and serious car wrecks. Not as much drunk drivers just a bunch of drunk walkers. I feel that if everyone either walked or biked everywhere, the community would be a much better place as a whole. You would be able to meet new people everyday. You would never have to worry about car insurance anymore because you wouldn't have a car! No more money for damages or issues with the car. The community would just be a lot more peaceful if cars weren't involved with our days society. Just like when Heidrun Walter stated when they had a car they were always tense. Now that they don't they are much happier! The Environmental Protection Agency is already promoting car reduced communities, which I think is a good idea! I think we should also have a day like Bogota had when they go a day without cars for their improvement campaign. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths. This would also improve traffic if we cut down on cars in the United States. New restaurants and shopping districts could be made from the outcome! As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak in 2005 and is now equal to where the country was in January 1995! A study last year found that young drivers decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009! Im all for cutting down on car usage in the United States! I think it would be an awesome opportunity to be apart of.    ","Dear Principal, I think you should require all students to perform community service because it helps the environment to stay clean. It decreases the risk of humans and animals from getting sick. Also, it helps students take responsibility of cleaning after themselves whereas people just litter and throw stuff on the floor. It harms animals because if you throw something like plastic on the floor and a cat comes and eats it, it can choke and die from the plastic you threw on the floor. I think it is a good idea to require students to perform community service. The main reason why I suggest this is because students will take responsibility of cleaning after themselves. If some students do not want to perform community service they should at least clean up after themselves and recycle things like cans that they finish drinking. I highly advise that you make students perform community service because students will help the community and most importantly help themselves from littering and killing animals like birds or cats. Students should participate in this activity because it will improve the way they work outside of the house. Another reason why I suggest community service is because it will not harm the environment. People shouldn't slack and throw objects on the floor because it doesn't look good and most important, it harms animals. If a tourist from a different residence comes to visit the city you live in and it is trashy he probably wouldn't want to stay there. Not just students should participate in community service but adults should too. Not all people litter and I thank the people that clean after other people, but all should clean up and pick up trash off of the floor even if it is not yours. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      ","When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project. A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself. When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing. School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have. Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at least have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on. If they have to have a project it should be something they do not stress over, but something they are confident in doing.                              ",,,,,,,
755,923,"I do not participate in the sports and not very many activities so this does not really affect me. But this is still not very fair because the students grades are C's. The students do like the sports and activities but it is too hard for them to reach grades above a C. The students should be able to decide whether they need C's or B's and they will most likely choose C's. This change could help bring the students grades up but it also might not. If the change were to happen there is a 50% chance that the students will try to get B's. But there is a chance the students wont even try to get the B's. The students might decide to not even try to get grades unless the policy stays at the C grade average. The students will dislike the new policy very much so it is a good idea not to change it. If a majority of the students that try out for the sports, and the students that enter the activities already have B's then i would say go ahead and change the policy. but if a majority has C's the i would keep it the same. You, the principal, should try out the new policy for a month and if grades start going up to B's for the sports and activities keep the new policy, but if grades don't go up or they start going down change it back to the original policy. There should be a vote for the new policy and on the ballot the choices should be ""try the new policy for a month"" ""make the new policy perminent"" or ""not have the policy""","It was a normal day at the lunchroom when I noticed a new girl standing in the lunch line. She started to walk to the empty lunch table where she sat by herself, because no one invited her to their table.""She smelled funky and looked funky too"" I thought to myself. I turned to my left to tell Generic_Name about the girl. I quietly whispered in her ear,""Do you see that new girl over there?"" She looked behind her back and gave her this nasty look. ""Should we go talk to her?"" I asked. ""No! she's not like us"" Generic_Name exclaimed. I listened to Generic_Name and never got the chance to talk to her, and now she's one of the most popular girls in the school. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best. The first reason for seeking multiple opinions is because you see from a different point of view rather than just one person. When I'm having a problem with something I always ask multiple people and see what they think I should do. For example when you go to the Ice cream shop and you always get Chocolate but you got bored from it. You ask your sister on whether you should try a different one this time and she tells you,""No, it's probably going to taste bad."" You end up getting Chocolate and it just doesn't taste good anymore. You regret not asking your parents. And you lost a chance of trying something different because just one person thinks it's not a good idea. Another reason for seeking multiple opinions is to hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved. For example you are going dress shopping for Prom. You pick out a couple of dresses and try them on. You pick out your top two and ask your friends which one they prefer. Some picked the Red one and some picked the Purple one. You're torn on which one to get, but hearing other people's opinions helped you pick. Finally you decide to get the Red one because it was picked the most. Just listening to what other people have to say and the things they point out that you didn't notice help you make a better choice. The final reason for seeking multiple opinions is that it makes you think twice about which advice suits you best. For example I'm in the store at the Smithsonian Zoo and I can pick one bracelet. The first bracelet has my favorite animal on it but it's not cool, and the second doesn't have my favorite animal on it but it's cool. It's a tough choice to make but you always have to think of what suits me best not what suits the other people best. I shouldn't just buy the first bracelet just because everyone thinks it's cool. If I like the other one better then I should stick with that. It was a beautiful day during summer. I woke up feeling the warmth of the sun against my skin. I slowly got out of bed and went to brush my teeth and get dressed up. I had two choices to make. So I asked my parents and my sister if I Should wear noodle straps with jeans or a dress. Majority picked noodle straps with jeans, and so did I. It was a great choice because it was really hot outside. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.   ","Technology gets a lot of backlash, but in reality it is our friend. Technology empowers and teachus us. Without it, we wouldn't be as informed of the world as we are now. For this reason, advanced technology should continue to be used. Introducing the FACS technology in schools would be valuable because it would create a more beneficial enviornment for everyone: society and individuals alike. Implementing the Facial Action Coding System into schools would be very valuable for society as a whole. The article states that the software provides the exact emotions of someone. For example, the machine might declare that someone is ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" (paragraph 1) Teens' actions related to their emotions are still fairly unknown, so having this information on adolescents in particular would help us be able to identify the root of the emotions later on. It's clear that FACS would seriously benefit science. Perhaps the most important reason for going through with this technology is that people would be more honest with each other at school. Enabling teachers and students alike to see how others are feeling would create a distinct openness in the school. Students would no longer feel that they have to put on a ""happy face,"" (as the article mentions in paragraph 9) when they're sad. There would be no point for this deception, since FACS would see right through it. People who felt sad could be comforted by others. Students would be more happy than they are now, at the end of a long school day. Having the FACS technology in schools would create an enviornment of honesty and happiness. It's true that having a machine see right through you would take some getting used to. But this unsettling feeling is overcome by the fact that this technology benefits science and our enviornments in a huge way. It makes us into a better people, so the question is, why would we not go through with it? ","Imagine having to prepare yourself every morning at the crack of dawn for school. Instead you recieve a chance to take all of your classes online in your very own home. Some may disagree that online school benefits students because they look at it as an easy way of getting out of public schools. However online school benefits the purpose of students learning more than public schools would because students would focus more on work than getting distracted by others or noises, it's easier to learn being in a place your more comfortable in, and they would have the advantage of getting in less trouble and the benefit of learning more. To begin with, online school would benefit students by helping them focus on getting their work done in peace rather than getting distracted. For an example, when a student is doing online school it's easier to focus on their work rather than being in a classroom worried about what others are doing. While students are doing online school they absorb more information by watching a screen in a quieter enviroment rather than having a teacher repeat their selves because of the distractions. Another example would be, while a student is taking online school they will be able to focus and understand what they're being taught rather than having to listen to what is being done with noise. Also, online school is less stressful because you don't have to deal with classmates becoming distractions your only concern is your work. My last example is, a student that is using online school doesn't stress as much about their grades not dropping because they are being able focus a lot more. Furthermore, having online school benefits students learning abilities to increase because they're comfortable with their work place. For example, when a student is taking online school they will have a work place that is comfortable to them. The students that are comfortable are going to get more work done because they are willing to stay rather than students that aren't comfortable will want to leave more than pushing their selves to finish. My next example is, when a student is comfy with their enviroment they start to think more which gives them the benefit to understand what is being learned rather than the student being uncomfortable and rushing to go. Students that do online school tends to pass their assignments because they were comfortable while doing the work their brain was able to function increasingly which led the students to understand what was being learned through the lesson. My last example is, when a student is doing online school their brain is able to relax which helps the student take in more information rather than your brain being smothered. Last but not least, being enrolled into online school can also help the student chances of staying away from trouble and learning more because they're away from the drama. The student would only have to keep focus on their work. For example, the student wouldn't have to worry about getting in any fights, suspensions, or disagreements because they would be at home doing their work. Also, the student wouldn't have to worry about being bullied because they'll just be doing the work one on one with a teacher. For this example, students that are enrolled online have less of a chance being involved with any trouble, so they'll be able to asborb more information and be ahead of the game rather than a student enrolled in a public school would because they would have a higher chance being around drama. For the last example, Students that are enrolled in online school has a higher chance of being more successful because they wouldn't have much of a problem. In conclusion, some may disagree online school benefits students because they look at it as an easy way of getting out public schools. However online school benefits the purpose of students learning more than public schools would because students would focus more work than getting distracted by people or noises, it's easier to learn being in a place you're more comfortable in, and they would have the advantage of getting in less trouble and the benefit of learnng more.","Lowering our car usage will be beneficial for all of us, the advantages of doing this will be huge, and will help the enviroment. Lately a lot of studies have revealed that one of the most eviroment-harming actions are the emissions that cars release into the atmosphere. If we lower our car usage we will help the enviroment of the planet we are living in, it only seems logical to do so. One of the reasons lowering car usage would be helpful is beacause it would significantly lower gas emissions from cars. This would greatly help our enviroment. According to the text, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". This shows how harmful this emissions are, and why we should try to lower them. Lowering our car usage and creating car-free suburbs or car-reduced communities would help our daily life. Driving a car every day can be stressful because of trafic and road rage. lowering our car usage would help people relieve stress and even get some excercise. According to the text, ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This shows how stress-relieving reducing car usage could be. Also lowering car usage could be a way for the goverment to create more bicycle paths. This would be really helpful to the people who only have a bicycle as a way of transportation. According to the text,""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaing tha began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" There are some people that do not agree with this idea, most of them say that it would hurt the car industry. Of course it will, but this is for a greater good. So let's reduce our car usage and help our enviroment.            ","Dear principal, I believe that you should not require students to do community service. I have this opinion because not all students have the time to take a part in community service. For example, some students have a job, or they go to day cares or after school clubs. Plus, we students have homework and chores that we need to take care of. It is a wonderful thing when a student decides to take a part in community service, but there are some people that simply do not have the time. If you require us students to community service I am sure that there will be some conflict. So please Mr. principal, do not force students into community service. I am sure that the students that have the time and energy to do community service will be involved in it. Further more, I believe that if you require students to take part in community service that you will not be able to recognize the students who do it from the goodness of their hearts and not because they were forced to. In my opinion, you should reward the students who take the time to do community service and work hard for others, instead of making everyone do community service. Plus, if you reward the students who do take part in community service, I am sure that many more people will join and help with community service, and without the attitude or the feeling of being forced into it. So please take my advice Mr. principal, do not require students to take part in community service. Although it may seem like the right thing to do for our community, and you may feel you are teaching the students discipline and how to be helpful, in the end, I believe that you should leave things the way they are and see what happens from here. Have faith in your students, I am sure that many students will be involved in community service without you forcing them to. And although many of them cannot take part in community service, I am sure that they would love to help if they could. With all do respect, requiring students to be involved in community service is not a wise decision. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I hope I have enlightened you with why it is impossible for every student to be involved in community service. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Many schools and classes required students to complete summer projects. These projects are generally meant to introduce a subject or refresh the students memory in a subject area. Since these projects are teacher-designed, many of them fail to achieve the purpose which they are meant for and instead just become another tedious task on a kids to do list. Students should be able to design their own summer projects in order to prevent cheating, encourage creativity, and so the students can be more engaged in their project. One big problem with summer assignments is that they are easy to cheat on. This is a problem because if a student cheats on a summer project, he or she will fail to get what they were supposed to learn from that project. A good example of kids cheating is a summer math packet. Many apps such as mathway and photomath can be used to take a picture of the problem and get the correct answer with all the steps. Students could also just simply find all the right answers online or consult with another student to get the answers. Student designed projects could eliminate the possibility for cheating by making students each produce their own unique project. A good example of a student-designed project that would eliminate cheating is a math teacher asking his or her students to design their own math problems. When the students submitted their problems the teacher could then easily compare one students work to the other students and also to students on the internet. Students could also cheat on other assignments, such as reading a summer book, by just using the internet to look up a summary. Therefore, instead of making students read, the teacher could assign a short essay on any topic, helping students practice writing. Overall, student-designed projects are just harder to cheat on because they require that the student produces his or her own unique project. This can ensure the teacher that the student is actually learning what they need to rather than getting answers from a computer screen. The second reason that summer projects should be student-designed is that it would encourage creativity. Rather than doing mindless busywork, students would be encouraged to think outside the box and conduct their own project however they see fit. This would make students more likely to complete their summer projects and more likely to actually learn their info because they would have to apply it in order to design a project. A good way to think about this is with science projects. Throughout most students school careers many have to complete a science project. These projects require that students design their own projects that will later be presented in a competition. Unlike normal school events, science fairs like this inspire tons of creativity and even draw in attention with the outside world. Many gifted kids experiment with vaccines, robotics, and even engineering. This application of skill and creativity is able to show the teacher what a student is like, which then helps the teacher understand the student better moving forward. It can also help the student better show the teacher what he or she is capable of and how smart they are. Projects being student designed would also minimize the burden of a teacher to grade the projects. All of the projects would be unique and present new viewpoints on the topic at hand, some of which the teacher might not even know. Also if students make their own unique project they would most likely receive full credit since the only standards they have to achieve is the ones they themselves set. The teachers could simply grade based off of creativity and whether or not the student completed the assignment. The final reason that a student-designed project is better than a teacher designed one, is that a project which is designed by a student would be more engaging than a teacher assigned one. One example is summer reading. Most of the time teachers assign one book or an extremely limited variety of choices for the student to read over the summer. Many students tend to be extremely bored reading these books or just simply look up a summary and remember it. Instead of doing this students could instead let students pick out their own book, so long as it is a certain topic and/or in a certain genre. If the students were to pick there own books they would be far more likely to actually read the book and be engaged with it. If they enjoyed the book more and actually read it, then they would be more adept in assignments and discussions relating to the book that they read. Another good example of student-designed project is once again the science fair. Science fair projects are basically just student-designed science labs. The difference is that when a student is doing their science fair projects, they are generally far more interested and willing to put more work into their project. There is also another benefit to a project being more engaging to a student. If a project that a student completes is memorable and engaging, a student will be far more likely to remember that info moving forward. This would help the student have a better base of knowledge and perform better in the class that the project was assigned. By designing their own projects students would simply be more interested and more committed to learning over the summer than if they completed a teacher-designed project. Overall, the benefits of student-designed summer projects are enormous. Giving creative direction to a student is crucial to making sure they retain information during a long break like summer. Students would be far more engaged and motivated to complete a project that fulfills their specific desires and interests relating to a topic rather than do just another summer packet. They would also show far more creative integrity and creativity compared to a normal project. Schools across the nation should integrate student-designed projects into their curriculum.",,,,,,,
519,494,"What I think about phone and driving is that it is dangerous it can cause an accident and kill someone. For example, what if someone crashes and kills one of your family member just because they were on their phones or you crash into someone because you were on your phone you would feel bad for the person you crash and the reason was for being on your phone you might end just getting arrested. This shows, that no matter whenever you are driving you should keep your eyes on the road something can easy cause a accident so fast. This is important because, now they have made a new aw about if a police sees you with a phone on your hand while driving you will get ticket or get arrested just to prevent an accident. Clearly this is why its important to not use your phone while driving.   ","Summer is all fun and games right up until you see the big 100 problem algbra 2 packet Mrs. Generic_Name left for you to do over summer. You had dreaded the day to do it, but nect week starts school. Although this is frowned upon through most sutdents eyes and wanting to determine what they have to get done, their teachers know what they have to achieve to ready themselves for the next grade. Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Even though many student believe they are mature enough to assign and design student based summer prjects, they do not know what is in store for them in the upcoming grade. My aunt had always been a straight A+ student athlete, getting great grades while playing a sport, she had also had a job working at a restraunt down the street from my grandparents house. She had always had an idea of what to expect, because of the mnay assignments he had been assigned to complete before the school year started. Many students go into the school year blind and have to figure a way out of the darkness, but if teachers create summer project for their students to complete, students will have an idea of what to expect from their teachers and the work load that carries over with them. Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Most summer times are used for having fun and hanign with friends in a teenagers mindset. But as teens get older they are needed to be more responsible and act as young adults. My uncle had struggled with school through highschool wanting to succeed but could never. He had always turned things in late and procrastinated until the last second. Until he had to figure out that the adult life is coming around the corner, he had started to turn things in on time and get the good grades by teachers personally assigning him stuff to work on over the summer to help him get ready for the school year and showing that being responible and orgnaized will help you succeed through life. Teacher designed summer projects will help students prepare on how to be responsible and complete their work on time and not preocratinate until the last second and prove that being responsible and completing work on time will help them through life. Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Many student will not have the right abilites to challenge themselves as hard as they should be, even though they are asked to design challenging student based summer projects. Most kids in school do not challenge themselves as academically as they should. Kids goof off until the last min until assignments have to be turned in late and asking for mercy to their teachers what can they do to get their grade up. Students are never up to challenge their academic capabilities and could not create student based summer projects. Students would try and find the easy way out. Teacher designed summer projects will help students prepare to be challenged through the upcoming years and work around the problem instead of trying to hit right through it. Being responsible, turning in work on time, expectations for the new year, and being challenged through summer assignments are a big take on how students will preform through their school year. Even though teacher based summer assignments are frowned upon, they will help the age of students ready for their school year and strive to working harder, faster, and smarter. ","Dear Principle, An issue concerning community service has come up and is in debate. I am writing this letter concerning this issue. My opinion is that students should be required to do community service. Community service is a great way to build good character and learn how to appreciate the things you already have. When helping other people and seeing how bad there situation is compared to yours you begin to be grateful for what you have in life instead of becoming jealous and vain of other people. It builds good character by giving kids the sense of accomplishment, happiness, and pride of helping others and making there lives better. Community service would make students better in the class room and teach them how to be great respectful people. If your school begins the requiring of community service it will spread to other schools. There now would be more and more people helping out there community's making the world a better place in a sense. More people would be humbled and a new hope of a better life and neighborhood restored in peoples hearts. Just imagine this whole country helping each other making the best of life instead of putting people down, out on the streets and starving with a family to feed. I'm aware that some of your students do not support this movement to require community service. I grantee that after there first service project they will fall in love with the idea. You just have to give them the chance to be apart of it. All it takes is a couple hours of service and it can impact a persons life like you can never believe. Also by enforcing this your school would become a better place for students to learn with a decrease in bad behavior by students and trouble makers. I encourage you to make community service apart of your school. I hope this letter can let you understand how awesome this experience would be. By making a small change like this you will change many young students lives and impact your community in a positive way. I strongly support the idea of students being required to do community service.      ","Have you ever heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

But i also think that's a good idea because that would make students study more for they can have better grades. But i don't really know if its a good idea or if it is!!! Ok i think that its a good idea because it might get students to make a good grade, For a better life. And if they study and they are good at sports that is going to help the in life because they might get a scholarship for doing that. But I think that right now they have a rule that says that "" if you don't have a C or higher that u cant get in any of the sports "" If you want to do that, guess that would be a good thing for me!.. I think that my friends will be ok with it too. I think that with a C we are ok. mostly of the wrestler's have at least a C. And if we change that rule, we will lose many of our good sport people. And we will lose every single game, that wouldn't be a good thing for our school. but i really think that u shouldn't . I just guess that , well that's my opinion i don't really know what you are going to chose but please don't change it. its going to be issue with some people because they really want to be in sports and they wont be able to! i sometimes get good grades but if i don't .If i mess up for one report cared i wont be able to get in the sport i want to get in. I don't really think that I would get lower that a C . its because other people don't get higher that a C. and B is going to be WAY harder to them. we have fun day! and if we don't get a C or higher we don't go to that! Or if we have a referral, if we get sent to the principals office, or something like that we wont be able to go. Some people didn't go because of the grades. They got lower that a C and they couldn't go to the FUN-DAY! With care , STUDENT_NAME","Dear, Senator Hi, my name is Khalyl Silver. I'm fourthteen years old, living in a small town in Florida called Boynton Beach. I go to Boynton beach community high school and i'm a freshmen. The reason why i'm sending a letter to you is because on my writing test they were talking the electoral college. The question was should we keep the Electoral college or we should stick to voting for president. I'm with we should just stay voting for president. The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that ( under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.) I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting.

It is important to study Venus because it is simular to Earth. It is closest to Earth by density and size. It is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore Venus. Venus is simular to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans. Venus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Venus is also are nearest option for a planitary visit. It is dangerous to be on Venus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric oressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to. NASA is trying to find out things about Venus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close and they think machines will help them do that. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is simular to Earth. Venus once had oceans like the Earth does now. NASA and scientists are looking into possible ways to explore Venus. This exploration will help find new facts about Venus.",,,,,,,

Distracted driving has become dangerous practice on our roads and highways. If you need a reason to stop texting and driving you shouldn't be driving in the first place. first of all it illegal to do and its very dangerous you could hit another car or hit someone in the road. Some more reason are consider the people you have in the car when you text and drive you are also putting the passengers at risk when you do so. Another one is think about other people driving. you could hit a family driving home and kill all of them if you text and drive. Think about the consequences next time you think about picking up your phone while driving. Somethings you can do if a text is really that important you can pull over and then send the text. Although many cars and trucks today now have buttons on the steering wheel where you can press one button to pick up a call or to text someone back. If you drive older model cars you should maybe invest in a new car or even a more hands free phone. There are about 3,477 people who died from texting and driving back in 2015. Just be careful on what your doing while driving make sure you keep your eyes on the road at all times. Next time you go out on the road think about what could happen if you look at your phone while driving. Keep in mind that there are other peoples lives a stake when your driving distracted. Also keep in mind the people in your car when you have the urge to pick up your phone. Cites I used for this essay: https://www.napolilaw.com/article/6-reasons-shouldnt-text-drive/ https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/10-reasons-you-shouldnt-text-and-drive/ Texting and Driving Statistics in 2020 | The Zebra www.thezebra.com PROPER_NAME   ","Summer is already a time where students want a break from school and adding a summer assignment will make students less motivated to do it. If students are able to design their own summer projects they'll have more motivation, use their own creativity and avoid procrastination. First, students tend to always procrastinate with a lot of homework assignments,especially over big breaks. This can lead to not doing an overall good job on a project, which can then lower students grades. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I had a summer assignment due by the first week of school. I had to read any book that my teacher had put on a list. The list was of super boring poetry books that I had nothing in common with. I had to pick a book so i finally picked this random book, Fly. I didnt want to read this book so I waited until the last week of summer break to read it. Little did I know that I had to write an essay, create a poster about the book and create a short film about it. I was up every night that week trying to complete it last minute. When I got to the first week of school I had received a 78 on the project. This was not the best I could of done, but because I waited last minute I got a low grade. If I had a book that I was interested in this would all of been avoided. Next, creativity is something that people lack nowadays, they always rely on others to create something for them such as projects, work, etc. If students are challenged to use their own creative minds to create a project it will help them for the future when they need to do these things for jobs. I am someone who hates being told what to do and how to do something, so being able to design my own project will make me want to do it even more. I had a project that I got to design for my chorus class that I was in my sophomore year. I got to create a schedule for elementary school choirs, that was the topic I got to choose myself because it seemed interesting. I did my own research and found the perfect teaching plans for an elementary school choir class. It was such a good project because I was able to create exactly what I was passionate about, but it was still related to the class I was in. The elementary school across the street from my high school liked my ideas so much from my project that this year they use it for their lesson plans. Lastly, students already have very little motivation to do anything in the summer time. All they want to do is have fun and not have to worry about school projects. Teachers expect us to want to do everything that they assign and thats not always true. If they want to keep students motivated and to do something well done, then teachers should have students do their own work. Forcing us to do something also makes students not motivated. In my sophomore year, I had a few teachers force us to do assignments that were very boring and it made me not motivated to do it at all. If I was able to design my project I would of been happier and not have felt forced to do it. I would of enjoyed working on the project and I would of done my best on it. It is nice when teachers come up with ideas on assignments because then students will have deadlines to complete it by, its more organized and teachers dont have to worry about students going off topic, but having students pick what they want to do will make a better project overall because students will be more motivated to do it, turn it in on time, not procrastinate and use their own creativity inside of their summer projects.","Dear Principle, Hi. I am an eighth grader at your school. And I am going to propose an opinion on whether or not the whole school should be required to do community service or not. My answer will be supported with examples and other forms of evidence. I think that you should not make everyone do community service. There are plenty of people who should do it and people who cannot do it. Many teens these days play sports and have families to attend to. Although everyone SHOULD do it, doesn't mean they can do it. I, for example, can't because of baseball. I play in two different leagues and I am trying out for the school team. There are many others who are just like me and just can't even if they wanted to. The people that do have time to do it are doing good for our society and so it does not mean that everyone must contribute. Also, if you think about it, a lot of teens, especially eighth graders, will not want to do it at all. Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc. And if you do not listen to me and make everyone do it anyway, there will be protesters and you never know what they might do to get you to stop it. It is great if people want to do it but like i said before, not everyone wants to or they just cannot have the time to help out. Thank you for taking your time to read my (hopefully convincing) letter to you. And that you please consider the possibilities of what might happen if you do go through with your plan. Sincerely, Eighth grade student, STUDENT_NAME","I wanted to convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, lets see how I do. The Seagoing program is a lot of work, but it changes your life. The Seagoing Cowboys program is awesome, you can change people's lives. If you join the program you can also go traveling, such as cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of United States, thatonly took about two weeks. Also you can travel to China and only take a month. Have you ever seen or cared for a horse? Well if you become a Seagoing Cowboy you could take care of animals, such as horses, young coes, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke claims you can as well have fun on your trip at sea. He says you can play baseball and vollyball. The Cowboys play with them, they played where the emty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis touraments or fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing around passed by time. If you do choose to join the amazing Seagoing Cowboys program, I hope you enjoy it. Have fun!!!         ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I believe this idea you are considering is an outrage! Many people now at days are complaining about how overweight children are. If you were to take away these opportunities, the students would most likely become even more obese because a large amount of the school has a C average. You should not eliminate these programs from our school day because kids look forward to them. Can you imagine coming to school for eight hours out of a twenty-four hour day and doing nothing but work? Us kids would be brain dead, beat! Some students actually enjoy school the way it is, but if you were to change that I doubt any child is going to be jumping out of bed happy to be going to school. School is difficult for some students, including me. If you were to make it so that kids have to have a B average to participate in other things besides work they may feel as though they aren't smart enough to do anything well. TEACHER_NAME I think it would be in the best interest to leave things the way they are!","The presidental elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the Electorial Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the Electorial Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the Electorial Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jepordize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system. To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the Electorial Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campains and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says "" If you lived in Texas, for inatance, and wanted to vote for (John) Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty-four electoral votes. Who are the electors?"" amd in source 1 it says ""THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise."" But honest is it really a comprimise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn't live up to American values. Another reason that you shouldn't support the Electorial Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jepordize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidental elections you can't, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves. The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the Electorial System is because of the ""Winners take all"" system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all."" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote. However even in the midst of all that wrong with Electorial System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don't know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's even a lie. We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance? To reiterate the bottom line is that these Electorial Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.    ","Exploring New Places ""Studying the planets is a amazing thing,"" said my science teacher. When studying the planets there is a lot of information to take in. The atomposhere on Earth is very different from the atmosphere in space. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Scientists should study Venus because it has similarites to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there. Venus is known as Earth's twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states in paragraph 4 ""Today, Venus still ahs some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This proves that Venus has some identical features to those that Earth has. It also states in paragraph 4 ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This also proves that Venus has some similar characteristics like Earth. This is how the Earth is similar to Venus and why scientist should continue to study the planet, consdering its dangers. The idea of sending humans to Venus is a topic up for debate by many scientists. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains how NASA has the idea of sending humans to Venus. It states in paragraph 5 ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This shows how scientists have come up with a way to send humans to Venus, even though no human has set foot on another planet. The author also states in paragraph 5 ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not excceed Earth levels."" This also shows how the radiation of Venus is not much different than Earth's and it would not exceed higher on Venus, so a human would be safe from radiation on Venus. Sending humans to Venus is another reason why the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursiut even though it has many dangers. With many great exeptions of studying Venus and sending humans there, the author also shows the dangers of Venus. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states in paragraph 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This proves that is dangerous to travel to Venus with high tempertures that would burn a human alive. The author also states in paragraph 3 ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" This also proves that Venus has expentionally high temperatures that no human can face. These are the dangers that the author takes into consideration when sending humans to Venus. In conclusion, the author from ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After evaluating the article, the author supports the idea of studing Venus. Scinetists should study Venus because it has similarities to Earth, they have the idea of sending humans to Venus, and also studying the dangers of Venus can help scientists conclude their idea of what it is like there.

519,923,Driving and technology today Over the years technology has advanced to where you don't even need to be at home to make a phone call now you can make one anywhere. Being able to make a phone call or text should have an appropriate time and place. By that I mean that you shouldn't be able to use your phone while driving. That is not he appropriate place nor time to use your phone. There is are many reasons why using your phone while driving is not a good idea. There is no reason why you should be looking anywhere else except the road while driving its a driving hazard and it can have many bad conquicences. Your eyes should be on the road the entire time you are driving like they teach you in driving school. Even if you look away for a second anything can happen when you are not paying attention. Today most car crashes or accidents on the road are caused by technology. Many states have made laws about how you are not allowed to use your phone while driving this is in place because it helps prevent bad things from happening on the road. Appropriate places to use your phone would be at a red light or in a parking lot before you start to drive or before you leave the place that you are at. Knowing when you should use your phone at the appropriate time can make the roads much more safer to drive on. In conclusion you should make the roads a safer place by not using your phone while driving it can have a various amount of coniquinces. Being safer on the roads and not risking someones life is way more important than a text that can be sent after you are done driving. There is not a text or a phone call that is worth more than someones life.   ,"During their summer vacation, students look forward to their time off of school and a break from the stress of their school work. However, often times, teachers provide students with an assignment to complete over the summer in order to ensure that they remain knowledgeable and don't forget what they worked so hard to learn during the school year. It is important that these summer assignments be teacher-designed because it guarantees that the students are reminded of what they really need to know, takes unnecessary stress off of students, and makes grading these assignments easier for the teachers. It is better for students' summer assignments to be designed by their teacher to make sure that the students are practicing the information that they really need to know and not completing useless assignments. If given total freedom to create a project just for the sake of learning something, a student could be practicing skills that will not be useful to them in the coming school year, and waste their break on an assignment that will have no value on their future education. However, if given a structured assignment designed by teachers who know the curriculum and what students will need to carry with them into a new school year, the benefit of the assignment would enhance greatly and there would be no debate on whether or not the project was beneficial. In addition, some students may take their projects in very different directions and end up ahead or behind other students who didn't have the structure to be as successful as they could have been. This creates problems, not only for the students, but for the teachers who will start the year with a class of students at all different levels. To avoid this problem, the summer projects assigned should be created by teachers, rather than the students. In addition, being given a set list of directions and expectation from their teacher would take stress off of many students who get lost with so much freedom. After all, it is their vacation, and while it is important that they continue to learn year-round, students should not have to stress over their school work during the break that they look forward to since the moment the school year starts. Many students, if told, ""write a five paragraph essay about your favorite animal that incorporates two quotes and three different uses of commas"", would be able to stick to that structure and hit every point of the assignment without any problem. On the other hand, if students were just simply told, ""write and essay about anything you want"", they get no sense of what their teacher is looking for and, again, could potentially write an essay that won't support what they should be practicing. All of this is to say, many students thrive with some sort of structure, which would only be provided if teachers created the project for their students to complete during the summer. Lastly, if teachers were to design the summer projects for their students, it would undoubtedly make grading them easier. Starting off the beginning of the year with an assignment from every single student that needs to be graded is a struggle when paired with setting up a classroom, meeting all of their students, and establishing the rules and curriculum in their class. It would lift a burden off of not only the students, but the teachers as well. To speed up the process, it would be beneficial for teachers to grade different variations of the same assignment, rather than having to carefully check a mix of project to see if it meets their expectations. In order to make the lives of both parties a little bit easier, teachers should create the summer assignments for their students. Why add to the stress and work load of both students and teachers by making students design their own summer project? Rather than benefiting students in a way that supports the goal of the assignment, to keep them reminded of what they need to remember in the future, it takes away unnecessary time from their well-deserved break. It just ends up doing more harm than good to both student and teachers, Luckily, there is an easy solution to this problem: make summer projects teacher-designed. ","Hello I am a student at your school and i think that community service is great. Some of my friends don't want to do it, so i came up with a plan to help both sides get what they want. The kids that are out here cleaning up the streets are doing a wonderful job but we need more support. If the people that are saying the don't have enough time to do community service because of sports ,should help out kids in the neighborhood stay out of trouble. They could go on the field or in the gym and play after the practices are over. People who are in band could perform a concert for the people in the neighborhood .They could also raise money and build a new park and plant some new trees , the kids could help. I will help you and the staff to encourage other students to help the community but donating a little time for a very good cause. Not everyone agrees that this is the best way to help out but when they see how good the community looks after we are done with our hard work the will believe that it is possible for change if every one chips in. I think this plan will help or community and change how people treat our environment . Hopefully real soon we see some changes in our community and it will get better. I think you should try and make every student do something to help us out , thank you for your time. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Im going to except the offer because Luke wants to take care of the horses,cows, and mules that are going over seas but if you like animals you should sign up or if you like takeing care of animals then get down here and sign up.

Luke and Don signed up. And if you have not been on the ocean and would like to well sign up.

Honestly I have to say that I like but at the same time dislike the idea. I like the idea because if a student in the school knows they are failing school and they play basketball but they cant play because they are failing they would try to bump up they're grades so that they can play basketball and also that would be good for the school if everyone had a B average. I dislike the idea because some students aren't as smart as others and getting a B would be very hard for them to achieve. What I am trying to tell you is to reconsider the idea before putting it into effect. Take some time to think about what ideas. You have to look at this from both ways/sides. In conclusion all I have to say is that I am glad that you are our new principal. You are doing an excellent job and keep up the good work. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","The Electoral College is not a very sufficient way of electing a president in democracy. The way it is run is faulty. If someone gets one more vote than there apponet they get all of the votes from that state? now what kind of sense does that make? doesnt make very much sense to me Mr. Senator. In a democracy the people should get to elecct their leader. I know that the Electoral College is usually gives the same results as the popular vote but its not always 100% accurate. There is honestly no reason to have the Electoral College. The founding fathers put it in place but that was 200 years ago and I have no idea what they were thinking. In my state, Florida in 2012 there was a very close election but Obama won by a very small margin and recieved all 29 votes from our state. That is some major bologna Mr. Senator. This is the United States of America and the canidate should recieve every vote he gets. The same thing happened in the 2000 election as well. it's not a reasonable sytem Mr. Senator. The Electoral College has got to go. It is a faulty and injust way of electing a president here in the U.S.A. I love this country more than your average guy, it's the greatest place on Earth and i truly believe that. I also believe that we need to get rid of the Electoral College because it is absolute trash.    ","Do you think Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? I think it can worth it because it is one of the planets that is close to us (Earth). Venus is sometimes called ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. The things I will get to tell you will explode your mind about Venus. First, Venus is very dangerous to visit. For example, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus`s atmosphere. In fact, scientists are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ao, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can sometimes be our neaarest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. Finally, NASA is working on other approchaes to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus`s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. These calcualtions by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. In conclusion, these are all the details on how Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They have a lot of factors that makes it so much fun to learn despite it`s danger. Scientist will find a way to reach Venus and study it for years to come. Would you ever study Venus after reading this?",,,,,,,
387,494,"Phones and Driving Cellphones are a big part of the modern world today. Everywhere you look there are people using their cellphone, but one place no one should never be using their phone in their vehicle. Driving while using a cellphone is very dangerous. If someone has received a text while driving they should ignore it until they get to their destination, or a accident could occur. When someone is driving their phone should either be in their console or in the driver side door, and it should be on silent. There should only be one exception to use a phone while driving, and that is if someone needs to use their GPS. Then it should be in a secure place where they can hear the directions and know where to go. Texting while driving can be very dangerous, it can cause accidents and they may be fatal. No text call should be so important that it cost someone their life. Phones are very good to have just not in the car.    ","Imagine never teaching your kid how to drive. Well thats what would happen if driverless cars happen. That memory stays with a person till they die. Ask anybody about how they learned how to drive they can tell you like it was yesterday. There shouldnt be driverless cars because its too dangerous and elimates many things. When you learn how to drive its a fun and exciting thing. You gain memories from that such as the mishaps you have while learning. You bond closer with whoever is teaching you. It even motivates you to do good in school and save money because once you learn you want your own. Any person can tell you off top when and how they learned how drive because its a ever lasting memory. By having driverless cars it takes away that. Where is the fun in driving if its doing it for you? As a teenager you look forward to first getting a car and driving around with your friends. Its a time where you can bond and be social. By having driverless cars its the fun out it , think about what is fun about sitting behind a wheel while it drives itself? Driverless cars create alot of danger also. Even today when drivers are more alert ever , there are millions of people who die in car crashes every year. Imagine the number of people who will die because people are not aware while the car is driving its self. Its in human nature for people to get a certain comfort level while doing something. Thousands of people on the road driving unalert and comfortable is not a safe thing. By having driverless car it takes out alot business also. There's million of kids who learn how to drive thru drivers ed. An average drivers ed course cost around three hundred dollars. Thats millions of dollars thats get thrown out the window if driverless cars become a thing. Thousands of people will lose there jobs because of driverless cars. Any way you look at it driverless cars doesnt benifit anyone but the people making them. Anything that puts people in harm and ruin businesses is not good for society. People driving around behindn the wheel on there phone while thier car drives itself is not a good idea for the society. At the end of the day driverless cars are too dangerous and elimate many important things we care about.","Summer would be a lot of fun if students were able to design their own projects. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. One may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed. However, summer projects should be student-designed because, students will learn more, students will feel accomplished, and lastly students will be prepared for life as adults. Students will enjoy their summer and their projects if they were allowed to design it. Students will learn more from their projects if they designed it! They would put more thought into their projects which expands their learning. A lot of of thought goes into designing a project. Students will have to plan out and organize their projects, which takes lot of learning! Students will learn more from working, on a project, on something that interests them. There is way more excitement and joy on learning when it is something in their interest. Rather then doing a topic a teacher wants students to do, students should be allowed to do a topic in their interest. Learning should not always be hard. These summer projects would be easier for students do on a topic they enjoy learning about! Students will enjoy learning more If summer projects are student-designed. There is nothing better then seeing a student feeling accomplished on a project they designed. Students will feel accomplished on their work. It will boost up their self esteem. They will have more confidence knowing they designed that whole project on their own. Students will take pride in their work. Students will be proud of themselves, not only will students be proud but parents, and teachers will also be proud! Students will also feel motivated to continue outstanding work just like that on any other projects in the future. It is a great feeling to have students feeling accomplished in their work and not just something a teacher designed for them. Students will feel as if they can do anything! Student-designed projects will prepare them for the real world as adults! As a teacher, their goals should always be to prepare students for adulthood! Students will be challenged to think outside of the box for their projects. The fact that the project is student-designed will push students to be creative with their projects, and also its gives them a challenge. Students will also learn how to be under a little pressure. Designing a whole project takes a ton a work and will have students under a little pressure. It will defiantly be good practice for the future in their careers. Students will learn how to plan and organize things on their own. While designing a project, there will be planning and organizing that comes with it. Which also prepares them for the future. In life there will be a lot of obstacles which includes lots of planning and organizing. From their projects they gain a lot of practice and tips that may help in the future. Students earn way more then just a good grade, They gain lots of knowledge that may help for adulthood. In conclusion, students gain much more than just a high five or a pat on the back from designing their own projects. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. One may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, students will learn more, students will feel accomplished, and lastly students will be prepared for life as adults. Students deserve the chance to show out their skills and show what they can bring to the table! There is a lot a student can show teachers just need to allow them to express themselves .Students will enjoy their summer and their projects if they were allowed to design it.","Don't you think that some students wont find the activities interesting? what if the students dont have time for an activity and participation due to the work load from school? Dont you think students would get injuries from the sports provided? In general, most people stress enough with other things out of school. So I think students should not be required to participate. Because not all students have time for an activity due to tight schedule, some students will not be able to balance a extracurricular activity with school work, and the activities that are available like sports can cause injuries. Most students already have tight schedules, and take advanced classes that challenge them already. Home work and projects stress students causing them to take a lot of time and effort to raise there grades. What I am saying is, the work load from school already keep students busy. Not everyone will have time to practice for a sport competition, or have the time to plan school events as student council. Time after school is valuable to students. How? students like to enjoy there hobbies like drawing, playing games, hanging out with there friends etc. Replacing that time with extracurricular activities would only stress the students more causing them to tire themselves. Family time is important to students too, but that time is limited because school takes mostly take half of the time in a day. About an average time of 7 hours school takes up in one day, so say like a student wakes up at 7:00 AM and school starts at 8:30 AM. School would end at 3:25 PM and the remaining time would be left would be about 6 hours for a student to do chores, finish homework, eat dinner and lunch with the following of other responsibilities. Doing an activity would mean balancing time and responsibilities at home with homework too. For some students it wouldn't be a problem but for others it might be. Not everyone is capable at managing time so as multitasking. Everyone is different but everyone has there own time and schedule knowing fitting in other activities is hard to do. Example, say like you do a sport which would be like volleyball and you sprained your wrist on your dominate hand. Your dominant hand is used for writing in school. That would mean you will have to take more time completing other assignment's due to the injury. Injuries will interfere with your everyday life because of the time the injury takes to heal. It can also permanently affect your health which causes your time management to shift permanently too. In conclusion, extracurricular activities impact students lives more then you think. Not everyone has enough time or have the ability to balance an extra activity and responsibilities out of school. In the end its mostly the students choice to join an activity or not. Cause you don't know everyone life out of school or the hardships that they are going through that are preventing them to participate.    ","Dear state senator, i argue you that we keep the electoral collage because of its many pros. Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president. Keeping the electoal college will keep a professional way of electing a president. The electoral college selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (and the trust given is rarely betrayed). With that said, it will be a fair and most likely a cheat free zone. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. When a run off happens this creates pressure of the voters, until the help of the electoral college comes in, which in this case helps break everything up and claim a true winner. For example, in 1968 nixon and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college, 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively. And that concludes why i argue you to keep the electoal college and not popular vote.            ","Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an ""Evening Star"" when its actually a planet. With Venus being provern a very challenging place to examine, ist hard to find out more abiut it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers. One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature. Venus is the hottes planet in our solar system. The planets temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme then what we've encounter on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. We could be living on Venus. Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus used to be covered with oceans that could've supported various forms of life. Even today Venus has rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is an opttion for a planetary visit. There are solutions for the temperature. NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentful anc radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions. Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studing Venus, helps us incase we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks.     ","The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The passage states that NASA's Mars Global Survey spaceraft revealed the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Gobal Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eigteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. In the passage, it says that on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There were no alien monument after all. The pasage also states that not every one was satisfied. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze. Therfore, researchers sent the spacecraft back to Cydonia, on a coudless day, and took more pictures of the Face. Malin's team captured extraordinary photos using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. Proving that the Face was not created by aliens. ",,,,,,,
387,757,"Phones & Driving There is no doubt that with how advanced technology has become in the past few years or so people have really advanced the technological possibilities. People have now started to make some of the AI's (artificial intelligence) like Alexa and Google Home. There are even some cars that allow you to ask it questions in order to find out the weather or finding the fastest route to take to work. Along with all of these technological advancements comes the ability to hook the phone up to a car using bluetooth. Now, should drivers be able to use their phones in the car while driving. There are some really good uses for using the bluetooth phone hookup. For one in Georgia people are not allowed to drive if they have their phone in their hand. This is where the bluetooth phone hookup comes in handy because you can do in the car phone calls to work or to somewhere else. This feature can come in really handy because if someone takes a day off of work and someone from their work calls them and starts to ask questions they can answer those questions right then and there. That way if someone was ever needed to give someone some advice in their place of work they could just click a button and give them the advice over the phone. There is also another use for the phone hookup to the car feature and that is so that someone can get notified if they do happen to have a family emergency. This is so that if someone does happen to have a family emergency and they are in the car already all they have to do is drive over to where the family emergency actually is. This is so that you can get notified if something bad does happen to someone's family member they won't have to wait until they get home to find out what happened. Once again being that when they do find out instead of having to leave the house again to go and see what happened because this person is actually out and about all they have to do is go to the place of the emergency. This may be one of the sadder ways that a phone can be used for while driving but it still is one of the more important things. The next reason for why people should be able to use their phone while driving is what if someone has to call the police. Using the bluetooth phone hookup feature that most cars have nowadays someone can call up the police and say that they need assistance with something. For instance let's say that someone has a very strong feeling that they are being stalked on the way home from work or somewhere else so they can then call the police for their assistance. This can also be a real life saver because this can also be used if someone's water breaks on the way to the hospital that way someone can go ahead and let the hospital know what is happening so someone won't have to wait. So, in short, phones can be used to save someone's life. Phone's have been useful since the time of their invention. From the ability to be able to talk to people from a long distance away to making sure that people can keep in touch with their work life. Next, being able to keep in touch with the family making sure to be kept in the loop if something bad does happen. Lastly, being able to call the police and other emergency services to save lives. Phones are a necessity in day to day life which includes on the road.   ","The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is about the present and future of driverless cars. In it the author presented both positive and negative aspectes of the driverless cars. After reading the article I am for driverless cars, because they will minimize the amount of accidents on the road and they could allow the ""driver"" of the car to be doing something other than driving the car. In my first reason for saying that I was for driverless cars I said that they would reduce the amout of accidents on the road. I say this because in the article the author talks about how google have had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 and they haven't crashed. This shows how safe the driverless cars are. If these cars were on the road over normal cars they would prevent the driver error accidents, in turn minimizing the amount of accidents. My other reason for being for driverless cars is they would allow the ""driver"" of the car to be doing something other than driving. BMW has been working on this feature of the driverless cars. They use a headsup displays in the car the show a form of entertainment and information systems to entertain the diver. And sence the driverless cars still need some driver assistance the display instantly turns off when the driver is need. This feature is not in a normal car. If the driver was need and they were texting the phone wouldn't turn off, there for making the driverless cars safer. I am for driverless car for the reason of ""drivers"" being able to something other than driving the car and driverless cars could minimize the amount of accidents on the road.      ","An important part of a child's learning is the time between school years. This time is usually spent down by the beach, or in the mountains. But, for some schools this time is used for projects; projects usually are a serious, mid-late-year rush to get a high weighted grade in before the year is over. Schools that require Summer projects need to switch to student designed projects. Students will have more interest in their projects if they deigned them. This Interest would make learning new things much more fun and exciting for students. If teachers deigned the projects, it would be a generic project with stiff guidelines. When students have the choice to choose, then more will do well compared to a teacher generated project. Students know what they like, letting them pick would let them dive deeper into a subject they like. Students don't like being confined with very few choices of what to do, this eliminates that factor by giving them a sense of freedom of choice. The purpose of the project is to let the students learn during summer, learning is easier when there is interest in a subject. If the students chooses then they are more likely to enjoy the project. Without constricting guidelines students could express themselves in new ways through their project. For example, a song, dance, modal of what they researched, or maybe an interview with an expert in that field. Having fun is an important part of this project. The fun in the project spurs the student to learn more for the project and with luck, continue to research and look up facts own their own, without the need of a project to guide them forwards. Teachers are incapable of filling the need of unique projects for each student. When assigning projects, they assign a single topic that can be worked on, and with strict guidelines on how the project must be completed. This formula usually ends with frustration on both parties as the students are unhappy at the constraints placed upon them, and the teacher is unhappy as they become apparent to the fact that they can't conform to every students needs without spending all of their time or making other students upset. A student is always willing to do more work if the student enjoys the work. Having the students deign the project that fits their needs individually, rather than a one-project-fits-all, teachers will not have any more work than before, students will enjoy their projects more, and project scores will rise.","Do you want to be forced to work on something? No one does and if a school makes you do an extracurricular activity thats whats going to happen. If we have activities in school, then the after school activity would have to be after school. There is a reason why we have P.E, FACS, coding, and stuff like that. We have those classes so that we dont have to do after school activity. The first reason why students shouldnt have to do extracurricular activities is because they could already be doing and activity. Whether its Babysitting siblings, playing with toys at home, playing video games, doing sports, or even doing a cooking class. Those are good activities, and even better, its an activity that they like. what if the student doesnt like any of the activity choices given to them. That could be bad for the child. Its like making a person eat when their full already, And to add onto this, The child could also be going somewhere already like out to eat, going to their moms house, dads house, friends house or a restaurant Another reason schools shouldnt make kids do extracurricular activities is because after a long day of school or work you want to just chill and sit down, listen to relaxing music, drink soda, eat food, and all that good stuff. What if your school took away that time from you? That wouldnt be that great because then you have no down time. another thing you could do in this free time is study, do homework, and even work on some other stuff. this time could give student more time to complete and understand their homework. This would make the student more focus and responsive during class. The last reason I have for disagreeing with making kids participate in extracurricular activities is because the kids pick up time would change. some parents that go to work everyday get sleepy. they want to sleep after work just like the child does after school. parents get sleepy fast and thats because they have a lot to deal with. If schools dont do this, than the after school stuff wont be a problem. another reason is because the parent could be working afternoon hours the day that the child has to be picked up. Then the parent is going to freak out and try to get someone to get the child for you. the next reason is because the parent dose not have enough time to pick up the chi;d. and the last reason is because maybe you dont have the money to drive miles to you son or daughters school. In Conclusion, if schools dont make kids do extracurricular activities, then none of this will happen. So I say we should save the troubles and just not do it. Treat people how you want to be treated. I think this is mean to the children because I feel like the children should have a say in what they want to do.","Dear Senator, I want to change to electon by popular vote for the president of the United States because it is easier and makes a lot more sense. When you vote by the Electoral College, you are actually voting for your canidates electors. When you vote for the electors, it doesn't neccessarily mean they will vote for their canidate. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, as stated in ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" There is a single argument against the Electoral College is best known as the disaster factor. In 1960, segregationists who were in the Louisiana Legislature succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. They did this so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In almost the same way, ""faithless"" electors sometimes refuse to vote for their party's canidate. Instead they cast a deciding vote for whoever they want. The electors and segregationists in the Electoral College think they can do whatever they please. They make decisions that wouldn't be fair to the voters or the canidates. If the voter votes for a certain canidate but the elector votes for a different canidate, this could cause trouble and madness within the election. The Electoral College is not always fair. However, if we switch to the election of the popular votes, the election would be fair. The canidates would be chosen based on the number of votes they got from voters, not by who the electors want to vote for. People also worry about the prospect of a tie in the Electoral College. If this happens, the election would be handed over to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote on the president. In this case, the Senate would choose the vice-president.""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative in Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". From this context, we can say that the House's selection can barely be expected to reflect the will of the people. I think the Electoral College is not accurate and the electors in it are not very fair. If someone elects a certain canidate, but the elector votes for someone else, there really isn't a purpose for people to vote. If people don't vote, then our country won't have a president. The Electoral College can take this country downhill in several  ways. We should let the people decide who they want to run their country. That way, the voting will be more fair, easier, and not as many bad things could happen while the process of voting is going on. I think the Electoral College should not be the way that our country's citizens should vote by. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME    ","The author supports the idea of exploring venus, because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth. However, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challengin are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such a enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because off the insight to eb gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.","The Face is nothing more than just some landmark. Sure, it may have looked like a face in 1976 but now we have better technology to study it. From what we have found, its just a landmark, you're a scientist, not a conspirasist. You are just believing what you want to beleive, and what you believe has no scientific evidence. When the mesa looked most like a face was in 1976, that was over 20 years ago. Technolgy has advance since 1976, I mean look at what we have now compared to back then. The NEWER photos from the NEWER peice of technology, the Mars Global Surveyor, has taken better photos of the mesa. That's right: a mesa. Even when you get disproved, you try to argue about it, now you're just arguing from a point of ignorance. Gavin said, and i quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the sameheight as the Face on Mars."" In conclusion, there is no face on Mars, just a mesa. You are arguing from a point of ignorance because anything you can be shot down almost immedently. Technology has advanced to meaning that we can get a better look at the mesa. So just look at the facts, and stop believing everything you hear. You're a scientist for crying out loud, act like one.           ",,,,,,,
387,923,"Over 69.9% of our population today owns a cell phone. We use them to text, call and even play games. We can carry them around with us to where ever we go, but does that mean that we should be able to use them in the car? Would there be another way around using a cell phone while driving? Honestly, we shouldn't be able to handle a cell phone while operating a vehicle and here is why. When you are driving, your attention should be focused on the road. A cell phone is considered a distraction because if something is going on in front of you, then you need to be able to pay attention to these little things to keep yourself safe. Abrupt stops, crashes, no turn signals, motorcycles, the drivers on the other sides of you and stop lights/signs are all examples of things you would have to keep your eyes on the road for. If your attention is somewhere else, then it will be extremely hard to catch situations that's going on in-front of you. Then, it becomes a huge hazard to you and others around you. Statistics show that 24,000 people are injured every year because of cell phones. On top of that, 995 fatalities happen within a year because of the same reason, texting and driving. (cited: https://www. carinsurancecomparison. com/texting-while-driving-statistics/ ) . People are now more concerned about texting and driving than drunk driving; But is there a way to break the system? There shouldn't be a way around texting and driving. Our phones now have a ""DO NOT DISTURB"" motion button while driving because its that hazardous. Our cars became Bluetooth to help texting and driving to be prevented so there shouldn't be a reason to pick up your phone as your driving. A way around is the wrong way because your taking a huge risk that can be avoided. Texting and driving is fatal. If a vehicle can have its own fatality rate... then we shouldn't enhance the rate because of a text message that can definitely wait. Driving is an opportunity that was given to us for easier transportation, but if cell phones don't stop being used while driving... consequences will be enhanced and driving privileges will be taken away. So to stop the fatal/injured rate, we should let the text message not be responded so we don't have to have a first aid responder come to us for a mistake we could have prevented.      ","""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article that is written by someone who has perspectives on what is good about driverless cars, and what is bad about the cars. After reading this article I believe that the driverless cars are going to be very helpful, and useful to people in the future. I believe that driverless cars will be helpful because the driver will not have to do much work, because the car drives itself 90% of the time. Also in this article the author tell us that the Google driverless cars, can drive up to half a million miles before the car crashes. Driverless cars will also be helpful because the people that were originally driving, do not have to memorize directions anymore. Being a driver requires a lot of attention to the road, and it is hard to pay attention to everything else that is going on around them. With the new driverless car, you do not have to drive the car 90% of the time, which allows for more time to think about other things or make sure that your kids are behaving in the back seats, without having to pay attention to the road. Although 10% of the time you may have to drive, the other 90% you are worry free of driving and can focus on other things that you need to. When people are driving themselves, they tend to be in car accidents very often whether it is severe or not. With the driverless car, you can prevent accidents from happening for a much longer time. Driverless cars have gone up to half a million miles before ever being in a single accident. Going half a million miles without an accident, or the car breaking down is unheard of and nearly impossible, but with the driverless cars, the technology is so outstanding, that the car can go this far. Using a GPS while in a car can be distracting and not safe to the driver, and everyone else that is in the car. Since the driverless car drives for people, now the people in the car can set the GPS and not be distracted by the road. With this feature, the car will always know when the right time to turn is, and will always get you to your destination on time. If you are a person who is late a lot or gets lost all the time, then you might be interested in this car, because it does all of the work for you. Driverless cars are a great idea because they drive 90% of the time, which leaves the driver to be focused on other things, it can drive up to half a million miles before crashing or breaking down, which will make the car owner feel very safe and secure in the car that they own, and also the car takes you where you tell it to because of the GPS system, which can make the owner worry free about getting lost. I believe that this car will be very successful, and it will be the future in the car industry.","Summer has always been seen as the well deserved break from school that students deserve. However, for many advanced placement students, summer can be filled with projects and homework to prepare them for their rigorous courses. These rigorous courses can be honors, advanced placement, or dual enrollment classes offered by the school district. Summer homework has become the distinction between academic and higher education options. The question remains, is summer homework more beneficial when it is designed by a teacher or by a student. Although students have the advantage since they took the course themselves while the teachers seldom take part of the tests or classwork, teachers would be better equipped in making summer enrichment projects because teacher are far more educated, have made many projects for students in the past, and have most likely taught the course in the past. These reason showcase why teachers are better at making projects for the summer than students are. It is a fact that teachers are more educated than students are. Teachers have completed years of college to be able to teach in a classroom. Students have not even complete high school compared to the numerous years of education teacher had to go through. Teachers also have to go through a apprenticeship and learn from a teacher after they achieved their college education. During this apprenticeship, many teachers watch and learn as older teachers show them how to make a project that can be best suited for their classroom. This amount of work makes educators more than capable of handling making a summer project for students. Students are not as educated as teacher are. Teachers went to college to learn and be able to educate. Their education makes them more than qualified to make and grade summer projects that they assign to students. While many students have no idea where to start in terms of making a project, America's educators have been learning these skill for generations. These reasons on education are why teachers are more qualified to make summer enrichment homework than high school students. Many teachers also have years of experience making projects for students to complete. Teacher across America have been making projects for students to complete for years. Projects arent new and teachers have been making and assigning them since day one. While many students have not once made a project for multiple peers, teachers have been making assignments and projects for years. Education alone should make teachers a far more appealing group to develop and assign projects and summer work for students to complete to understand the course. This amount of practice comes from their education and their time as teachers. Many students have no experience at all with developing and making assignments, this is a teachers job. This is why that experience alone and be the factor why teachers are more qualified to making summer projects than students are. Also many teachers, have taught the same class or at least the same type of class. Many classes, such as the advanced placement classes, have included the same teacher for most of their careers. This is the most important factor. Since teachers have been educating in the same fields and classes for the majority of their career, they know the material and curriculum of the class. This, opposed to a student who mostly likely only spent a school year in the class, makes educator qualified to be able to assign and grade summer projects. Students merely have attended the class for only a school year while it is apart of a teachers job to understand and master the curriculum of the course. Teachers know what is on the tests and what you need to know to be successful in the class. This is why teachers are far better at making summer projects than students. While many teachers have taught the courses, the students are the ones taking them. Students are the ones who have to study and do homework for hours and sometimes the information is not relevant for the exam. Teachers have not had the same point of view as students have today. Students at the end of the year know what they need to know to be successful in making summer projects and assignments. Although these are very valid points, they do not account for how qualified teachers are. As already mentioned, teachers have gone trough years of education, teaching the same class, and experience of making projects. Between students, who no little about the course compared to teachers, and educators, who spent years to be the best teacher they can be, teachers are far better at making summer enrichment projects. Many students are ill-equipped and ill-advised on making summer projects for them and their peers to complete and have a basic idea of the course itself. Teacher are more qualified to make summer project because of their extensive education and apprenticeship, their time making projects in the past, and time spent learning and mastering the course. These reasons, among many others, showcase way teacher are the best at making summer assignments and projects for honor students across high school in America. Although students have the point of view of seeing and participating in lessons, taking the tests and exams, and doing the classwork and assignments, it is not comparable to the advantage that many teachers have when education students. At the end of the day, teachers are the best to plan and make summer projects that can prepare students for their upcoming class. It is up to the teachers to teach and the students to learn the topic of the course. ","Do you think that students should do an extracurricular activity? There are multiple opinions on this question. On the other hand I believe that everyone should do an extracurricular activity because they can enjoy a hobby they love, make new friends, and exercise the brain in different ways. Having time to enjoy a hobby is a special thing. Not everyone gets to enjoy their hobbies everyday. To get to do that after school is an amazing thing. If you want to do a sport, join the team, and do your best. If you like origami, but there isn't a club for that, then start your own club and be in charge. You can always find a way to enjoy your hobbies. You just have to seek it out. Making new friends can be hard, but with extracurricular activities it can be enjoyable. If you have an interest and others share that interest. Then that could be a start to a good friendship. All you have to do is try to make friends. If you try and you fail, then you have to try again. Eventually you will succeed. Exercising the brain is really important. Not only does it expand your horizons but it also increases your IQ. If doing an extracurricular activity can enhance my learning process, than i'm all for it. Studies also show that people who do puzzles tend to live longer because they have more brain activity. I think almost everyone wants to live longer. Thats why exercising the brain is so important. There are a lot of pro's to doing extracurricular activities. If it can improve our lives that much, than im all for it. So do you think that students should do an extracurricular activity? I know that my answer is yes .          ","Voting, one of the most American things I can thing of. This is a democracy, and we have the right to vote for our leader, but not really. There is a thing called the Electoral College, and the electors that you vote for actually vote for the president. Although this does not seem fair, it is a great system. Almost every time your state votes for an Elector, he picks the President that your state wants. So it really is a great deal. My opponents belive that the president should be voted by popular vote, but i disagree. Richard Posner, writer for slate magizine writes that this method is non-democatic, and should be overruled(source 3, paragraph 15). Although you are not actuially voting for president, you are voting for who votes for president. This method equals out the playing field for states. Insted of all the power going to states like California or Texas. Presidents have to fight for every state. Posner also writes, sometimes the person with the popular vote will not win the election, like in 2000(source 3, paragraph 16). Although this was a huge disaster, it was the first time something like this has happened since 1888. Also, 4 years later George Bush won the election again, but for real. Some may say that America is not filled with the smartest, or brightest people. So you belive that we should hold the fate of who will be president in the hands of an adult who cant spell his own name. Someone ike that has as much power as a guy who has watched every debate, and has done research. So by voting for a democrate elector, your state will vote for a democratic president, if your state votes in a republican elector, then your state will vote for a republican president. It is as simple as that. The Electoral college provides a point system for every state. the biggest are California with 55, and Texas with 38. The smallest are the Dakotas, and they each are worth 3 points. The point system is based on population, and how many representitives you have. One of the best parts of this is that every state get attencion. Without this system, the candidates would only go to campien at the highest populated states. Then this would cause the smaller states to think that their votes don't matter, and then one day we are going to have a bad guy as our leader. In conclusion, I belive the Electoral College is a great system, and I hope it lives on. Although it is not really Democratic, it still is a better system than what my oppents belive we should do. This gives us a certantity of oucome, a president that everyone supports, swing states, big states, and helps to avoid run-off elections. So Senator, if you back the Ellectoral College, maybe we will vote you as our next President.                                                         ","I will be making an essay how the author supports the idea that studying Venusis a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Well Venus is actually the second plant on the Earth. Venus have challenging place to examine more closely. I really don't thing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite. What ever that means but the author has give us so many things about venus. One reason that I have found in the passage is that Venus is more than three decades. Venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans could travel to the planet if Venus, but how will they come back home. Well I don't know how they will be going back home. Even more challenging are the clouds of hightly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. Most importantly reseachers well I mean the author cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth. It can sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit. How I said in the beginning people can go to Venus for a trip, but how are they coming back home. The second reason that I have found in the passage is that NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Its solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Its not easy conditions but survivable for humans. Venus have never had a ship landing in that planet. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above the planet can provice only limited insight on ground. Because most forms of light cannot penetrate to Venus. This is in the passage,some simplifiled elecronica made of silicon carbide have been tested ina chamber simiulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted fro three weeks in such conditions. ","Have you ever heard of the Face on Mars? It's a landform on Mars that, from certain angles, gives the illusion that it looks like a face. Some people believe, however, that this was actually an alien creation. The Face on Mars is just a landform because it looks similar to landforms on Earth, only at certain angles does it look like a face, and high quality pictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform. The Face on Mars is similar to landforms here on Earth. One scientist, Garvin, states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" (12). Only at certain angles does the landform look like a face. The author of the article states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face"" (8). High quality ppictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform. In paragraph 11, The scientist says, ""...you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"" (11). The reasons that the Face on Mars is just another landform are that it looks like landforms on Earth, only certain angles show the Face, and high quality photos of the Face prove that fact. conspiracy theories are wrong because they don't have any facts to back up that this could be created by aliens. This is why the Face on Mars is not created by aliens, but by natural forces on the red planet. ",,,,,,,
423,494,"Although many may say that there would be nothing to gain by researching Venus. There would be something gained when researching Venus such as the history of Venus. Another would be the disigning of better stronger drone. The last reason would be to learn safe ways to stay on planets simular to Venus. The know history of planets can teach us what we can do to help our own planet and what to avoid doing. Stated in the article ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" the quote could teach us what not to do or we could end up near or similer to Venus. Disigning better stronger drones that survive harder condicions such as Venus is a good thing because there could be other planets that could require that type of drone. Stated in the article ""coulds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Scientists could find a planet that could be similer or alike to Venus and they may need a drone strong enough to survive the harsh conditions on the planet. Suvival on different planets that a scientist is researching is important and learning how to survive on Venus could be the first step. Stated in the quoted ""","Imagin if all summer projects were only designed by teaches. It would be no fun. Students should be able to chose whatevery they want to reaserch and make a project out of it. While some would prefer a teacher designed project, student designed projects lets students chose their own topic, experiment the way they want, and present it the way they want. Student designed projects lets students chose any topic they want. I love it when I get to chose my own project because I can research any of my desired intrests. Chosing my own topic also motivates me to get the project done; for that, I am a curious person. Any project should let students chose their own topic. Students should experiment any way they want. When I was a freshman in highschool my science teacher let experiment any way we wanted; I built a solar panal that followed the sun. That project let me have lots of fun and made me be crative. Student designed projects lets students expeiment in thier own way and have fun when their doing it. Presentations should be apeling and informative to the reader. When I design a project I like to make the project the most crative and informative. Most teaches just say to make a power point or an essay, but that doesn't show any crativity. Student designed projects lets students present how they want to present and let them be as crative as thay want. Some might like teacher designed projects because students do not have to think of a project; however, student designed projects let students chose thier topic, experiment however way they want, and present the way they want. Summer project should be fun and crative because it is student's break from school. Most student projects are fun, crative, and gives students freedom.","To the principal: I believe that the best cell phone policy is to allow students to have phone in school and allow them to use them during lunch periods and other free periods, so long as the phone are turned off during class time. Cell phones have become a near irreplaceable part of teens' lives today. The ability to be able to contact people at any place and moment in time is extremely important, to the point of being vital. For example, in case of an emergency, students would be able to contact their parents and the other people they would need to inform. Without this luxury- no, necessity- lives could be endangered. Moreover, students would be happier during school because they would be allowed to use their cell phones- at the right time, of course. Thus, students would have a more positive attitude during class, would work harder, and obtain better grades. Now, i understand why cell phones are generally not accepted in classrooms. cell phones can be distracting in class; you can talk, text message, and IM friends; you can play games or use the internet. With all of the things you can do with that one machine, it's no wonder that cell phones are deemed a distraction in classrooms. However, if cell phones were permitted to be used during lunch periods and other free periods, I assure you that students' cell phones would not be a distraction during class time any longer. If cell phones were allowed to be used in class, the temptation to use them in class would no longer exist. The reason for that is people always want what they can't have. In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain says that in order to make something desirable to someone, you must make it difficult to obtain. Since it would not be difficult to use cell phones, there would not be a need to have them banned in class- and banning cell phones in class would cause cell phone usage to go up. I hope that you consider changing the school's cell phone policy to be more lenient about cell phone usage, which would in turn give the school a more student-friendly environment.","Through the use of technology, remotely anything is possible. Everything is at our fingertips, providing comfort and complete bliss. It is easier than ever to get things done from remotely anywhere in the world. All areas of the globe are adapting to this ever growing phenomenon. It only makes sense that the question of whether or not technology should be incorporated into schools, and to what extent, arises. There are many benefits to adding technology in the classroom that can help make the teachers' as well as the student's lives easier, such as the use of online classes. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to learn at their own pace, easily make up work on classes they missed, and give them more independence. Allowing students to take online classes would tremendously benefit them since they will have the opportunity to learn at their own pace. Not all kids learn the same way and at the same pace, which is why alternative methods of teaching and learning need to be provided to cater for everyone. Distance learning with permit kids to take charge of their learning and learn when they feel most comfortable. Getting up early at ungodly hours to get ready for school wastes a lot of precious sleep time for full time students. The weight of staying up to study the night before before plus the dread of getting to class early in the morning does not result in a pleasant and healthy form of leaning. Rather, it creates problems for both the students as well as the teachers. Because of online learning, students will also have the opportunity to pause and listen to the lessons provided over and over again until they understand what is being taught. This allows for the students to go over parts of the lessons they are having trouble with and make sure they really understand. In addition, the kids will be able to take notes at their own pace without having to worry about scrambling to get everything down. This eliminates the stress and anxiety that comes with balancing getting everything down and paying full attention to the lesson being taught. With the help of online classes, students wouldn't lose as much class time on days that they have to miss school. Everyone has some off days. Whether it be because of a sickness, a family emergency, or simply a mental health day, students tend to miss a decent among of school when it comes to unforeseen situations. However, with online classes, students would be able to tune in to what they missed while they were away. The classes offered online would allow the students to stay up to date with what is happening in their classes and would ensure that they don't fall behind simply because of circumstances that were out of their control. If someone is diagnosed with a serious health issue, resulting in them misses tons of classes, they would still have the chance of making up all their work and catching up through the help of online classes. Online classes are able to limit students' stress of making it to class during difficult times in their lives and able to focus on themselves while simultaneously getting their schoolwork done as well. It is crucial that the school system understands and provides for students that wish to learn but are not able to because of life problems. Lastly, online classes would also increase the attendance rates for the school since the kids would be able to tune in through the comfort of their homes, any time during the day. Online classes would assist kids by making sure they don't miss too much of school and are still at the same level as their peers. Some may argue that allowing kids to learn on their own through the use of online classes would remove the structure they need in their lives and cause them to become lazy. However, offering online school to students can actually make them more independent and self sufficient. Students would be able to create their own schedule and hold themselves accountable to it. This creates a realistic environment for them since this is what happens in the workforce. They would be able to learn wherever and whenever they deem fit, allowing them to incorporate more school into their lives. Having so much structure in students' lives creates an unrealistic perception of how the rest of the world functions. After school ends, there are no more set schedules in people's lives anymore. So it would only make sense for students to get ready for that now. People also tend to counter that online classes would not have the same effect as regular classes and therefore would not benefit students. However, online classes would be incredibly beneficial for kids who simply cannot go to school due to life problems. In addition, some online classes are way cheaper than classes offered on campus. This gives students a chance to obtain a more affordable education and still stay on track. Allowing kids to take online classes provides many benefits for everyone. Student are able to learn at their own pace, they don't have to worry about missing work due to missing classes, and they are able to gain more independence all thanks to online classes. Being able to adapt to the technological advances is important if we all want to continue moving forward. Allowing students to experience online classes is a step in the right direction since so many benefits come with it.","How awesome would it be to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well, imagine touring crossing huge oceans and touring amazing places like Europe and China. Imagine taking a gondola to Venice, Italy. Or how about seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Seagoing Cowboys have the opportunity to explore these amazing places. It's not all about sightseeing though. You have to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Pretty much anyone can join too! Luke Bomberger was working at a grocery store and a bank in the normal city, then the next thing you know, hes in a different country exploring. Its a big change to go through. It feels good to help out innocent animals in need. Although the trips to and from the sea can be dangerous, its very worth it to go join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Its kind of like being a cowboy and a pirate. It is such a wonderful expierience to do this program. Its not something you can do everyday, its like being an NBA player, you cant just say you are one. You have to work for these things, only the greatest people get the opportunity to become great. Luke Bomberger was special, so thats why he qualified for the program. Being in the Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing, who wouldnt wanna be a pirate/cowboy. And that is why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program.","This technology of reading into students emotional expressions for the classroom can be beneficial because it gives a more in depth look into how a student is feeling during a specific lesson rather than them saying they understand the lesson when they do not. This new technology may make it easier for classrooms because some kids dont like to speak up when they dont understand something and that does not help the student or teacher. So this new technology will keep the teacher up to date on how there students or feeling about the lessons. Some students assume it is easier to just not say anything at all when they dont understand something. Students dont want to be a hassle for the teachers to have to go back and go over a lesson so they end up not saying anyhting on there confusion. Also students just do not want to be the only classmate to speak up. Dr. Huang says "" A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This can help the teacher in order to realize what they can do to make the lesson more fun like helping the students engage more. Also this can just help the teacher know what they can go over in order to make the students understand certain lessons more. This technology can help more so with the teacher because it is there job to help students when they do not understand something and to make the classroom learning process easier. Dr. Huang predicts that ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would really help teachers alot in the sense that they dont have to worry about if anybody is behind in there class because everyone will be at there own pace on different levels of the lesson. Using technology to read students emotional expressions during class will be very beneficial to the teacher and students. This will help the classroom flow smoother because the teacher will not have to worry about who is caught up and there understanding, if the computer can figure out where the student starts getting confused or bored. Then mabey eventually the computer will be able to modify the lesson for peoples learning pace and understandment.   ","Driverless cars would increase the safety of driving on roads. Driverless cars take away issues like human error. Driverless cars would also reduce crashes, and deathes, involving drunk driving and texting while driving. These would still be issues, for with all rules some are broken, however with driverless cars the effects of these incidents wouldn't be nearly as costly. Driverless cars allow for total control of the car at all times, something quite difficult for a human driver to achieve. Using devices such as the LIDAR and GPS, the car would have complete awareness of its surroundings, while a human driver can only strongly focus on a single direction at a time. With driverless cars including precautions such as the car alerting the human inside if they need to take manual control of the car, driverless cars are never truly driverless, almost like with an airplane. There is never only one pilot, the main pilot always has a copilot to take control if there is an issue that the main pilot can't handle alone. The main causes of car crashes are human error related, such as driving under the influence or texting while driving. Neither of these problems will have as huge of a cost to them if there are driverless cars involved. The driverless car will be able to respond to a stopping car faster than a person if they had been texting. Driverless cars will improve the quality of driving, as well as the safety of driving. In driverless cars, humans can be productive in other areas, such as doing homework or finishing a file report for a job. With only limited focus being needed of the human while the car is driving, the human's time can be managed more effectively. Having a computer drive the car would reduce the number of crashes that occur from drivers falling asleep at the wheel as well as other crash starters. All in all using driverless cars would greatly increase the quality and safety of being on the road.",,,,,,,

Letting students create their own project gives the students more enthusiam to complete it, more creative/fun projects can be done, and it will have the same goal which is to continue to learn throughtout the break. Throughout the school year students are given multiple projects by the teachers, some harder than others. In these projects you find multiple requirements, all teacher designed. When a student goes on summer break most of them are worried about getting to the beach or spending time with their family. Having a student designed project takes more load of the student when it comes to completing said task. The project would be able to relate more to the students life and point of view, and would the prompt would be fun to complete. When students get the oppurtunity to be creative and think outside of the box they do not fall short to the task at hand. Having completed a student deisgned task, it gave me more oppurtunity to think outside of the box and go above and beyond without getting the feeling as if it was classified as a school project, that most dread to complete. From the teachers standpoint having a student-designed project can go in the completley wrong direction, and steer the project away from the main idea it was intended for. The project is meant for you to learn, and having a student create the project could completely defeat the purpose of maintaining the learning aspect of it. The project would have some sort of creativity to it, and it be would getting straight to the point of understanding what needs to be done. The main goal of a teacher is to teach you and prepare you for the criculium guide you to success. When students leave for summer they forget more than half of the learned matieral from the prior year making it harder for teachers to teach because the basic learning aspects could be lost. That makes it harder for teachers to do their job and keep students foucsed and on school when just getting back. Having a teacher give you project to work on during the summer gives you a oppurtunity to still learn and focus on being a kid/teenager at the same time. Kids are creative, scientifically more creative than the average adult. When giving a project to the right students they can make something boring into a entirely different situation. Many students have come up with incredible ideas some adults would never have thought about. During the summer most students go on trips, play sports, hang with friends, or simply stay home and relax. Student-designed projects could give students the oppurtunity to have fun and complete what needs to be done at the same time without going to far out of their way. The projects could be student-designed and teacher edited, so when the student create the project the teachers could revise and make sure the students are staying steady on their learning task. The goal of having a summer project is to stay fresh in the brain and have a little bit of a challenge during summer, so you do not complety forget and lose focus during the school year. Students can achieve the same task while making it a better overall situation. Teacher designed projects can be fun too, but student designed projects give the student more of a chance to take control of something, realize the importance of whats going on, and how it can postively affect the students learning career. During a kids time in school there is not many oppurtunites to make your own project and see the affect it can have on you. Getting students involved helps them realize how important it is to their success as a future adult and their future learning throughtout school systems. Having a student designed project comes with many benefits not only to the students but the teachers. The teachers have less of a work load to complete, giving them more of a break during summer beacuse they will not have to create the project and focus on making sure the students understand the prompt.         ","Should cell phones be allowed at school? Many people such as adults don't think so. Maybe they just shouldn't be privileged at school. Perhaps only during free periods of time. I believe that cell phones should be allowed during school hours. I think this, because at least we're able to have ours on campus. Using our phones outside of class, and only during free time is a good idea. My reason for that is, ""why use them during class?"" if you can have your phone at school and not during class hours,"" who else will be using them during class?"" ""NOBODY"" and that's a good thing you won't feel left out! Having your phone during school is better than not having them at all. I'd rather be able to have it at least then at all. Beside what can you have you use your phone for anyways to ask how their class is going? Having my cell phone during free time is better because you would actually need it. Perhaps to ask a friend where they're at or to borrow some money, or maybe if they need a ride home from school? Any who, I think the first policy would work out great for schools now a day!","Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students would rather want to be able to work in their own comfortable environment and be able to work at their own pace. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they can work at their pace because if the students missed a day or two of school, the online class is there to provide them easy access to work they might have missed. Another point is, some students tend to much rather like to work in an environment they feel comfortable in or that they feel safe in. Lastly, It would benefit their learning skills by having a tool to use that could be helpful for them when they attend school personally. Students working at their own pace could be helpful and beneficial to them in many ways. Having to be rushed or pressured to do work may not be the best for any grade school students. If a student missed a couple days of school, the online class is there to provide for the lesson they learned the days of or the work that was missed without the work being turned in late or graded poorly. A student being able to work at their own pace is also extremely beneficial because it gives them more time to fix imperfections and be able to ace the work that was given. Students often do terribly on work they rushed on or do terribly when they did not have enough time to finish. Students usually tend to work better in a environment they feel comfortable and safe in. Students who dont like the environment they are in can get easily distracted in their surroundings. Being distracted can cause trouble all around. Not only does it cause trouble, It stops students from getting their work done and their peers work done. These online classes can provide them to do their work in a environment they feel that they are safe or comfortable in without having to distract themselves or anybody around them. If a student feels that they are uncomfortable in their surroundings, that can take over their mind and distract them from what needs to be done. Having an online class for students can be a benefit their learning skills by having a tool to use that could possibly be helpful for them for when they attend public school. Online classes could teach the student another way how to solve a problem in a way public school could not. With the information they learned online, they can carry that on with them and be successful in a class they have trouble on or for future references. The online class may explain the topic another way that the school did not and makes it easier for the student to understand what they are learning. In conclusion, students would much rather benefit from being able to attend classes from home than being able to attend public schools or having to do a class in school. These classes can help students in a way public school classes could not. Being able to work at your own pace, not be distracted while do work, and learning new topics can be helpful for somebody who needs online classes.        ","One of the reasons is that there could be very sick poeple you go by and it might make you sick and sad to see that poeple are sick.

For my second to final papagraph I would 1 Not want to get sick. 2 I would not wanna get killed. 3 I would not want to get impaled by debrie. 5 I would not want to get eaten alive. 6 I would not want to see sick or dead poeple on my trip 7 I would not want to crash and get stranded 8 I would not like o drown 9 I would miss my family friends and pets. 10 I would not like to eat rotten or smelly food or drinks. What would happen if you have to eat the animals then no more food for the poeple who need it and it would be cruel and you cant drink plain ocean water it needs to be distilled and run out of water faster. And if you fall over board you could get left behind or get saved and live to tell the tale or get thrown overboard or get eaten by animals or if the animals die then they get thrown over board and it would be wierd and gross seing animals being pulled along by the current. So in conclusion I would not want to join the ""Sea Cowboys"" or any thing envolving the sea i get very seasick easily around oceananic trips around large oceans/or large lakes. I also have had abd experiences with lakes and even channels. So i know that i would not want to go out on a two week trip on a boat...over a ocean.....where i could die.","Someone made a Facial Action Coding System, this technology is supposed to be able to know exactly how someone is feeling just by scanning that persons face. Is this technology valuable? Everybody in this world is different, not one person being the same as one another. That means that everybody feels different emotions about all different things. See where I'm going with this? It is pretty simple, how can something (A computer) Just know by reading your facial excpressions that you are angry, happy, sad,motivated, stressed, ext.? Every human experiences different emotions. Yes, some of them are the same emotions but if you put 100 people in the same room and told them something that was designed to make people angry would all 100 of those people feel the exact same way and have the same amount of anger towards it? I do not belive so. Some of the people would be mad, some would be happy, excited, and some simply might just not care. I'm highly pro-technology but, I do not believe that with the 7 Billion different people on this Earth, one piece of technology could be capable of acuratly telling us the exact emotions someone is feeling at that moment. Not just by scanning someone's facial expressions at least. So to end this pointless Istep rant, No do not believe that this technology is valuable.","Safetey is first, that is one thing that everyone want sespecilly in cars. Many people don't get that the idea of industries or companies making these smart cars is to help the enviorment by reducing the fuel use. Reducing fuel makes the enviorment more clean. There would be less cars and many of those cars are going to save the enviorment. I'am with the making of smart cars because the safety the car is going to have, saves money, and the smart car can save the enviorment. Car safety is one of the most impartante things. When a person buys a car safety is one of the things that people want more. The smart car has advianced technology that can indicate that a probleam is going to happen. Sensores are being involved with this smart cars, sensors can help do something that you can not do because you are doing something else. Sensors can help you to decress the chances that someone has. The smart car would have more protection to stellers or accidnts acure, these cars heve camras that can help incase of an accidents. And last smart cars would have a computer that has all the rules of driving that would allow it not to speed or do a wrong turn and even more. Many people have jobs far away from their homes. People want cars that can waste less oil for more miles. Smart cars reduce helf of what a normal car does. If fuel is wasted less then many products will reduce their price and many people would have to waste less money. People would save money and would have smart cars instede of normal cars. The economy would grow and people would be less poor then they are. The enviorment is getting to bad from the worlds global warminng that is incressung thanks to all the pollution humans do. Smart cars have the capabillity to use oil. There would be less oil wells in the whole world. Oceans would be less contimanated then they are know., ocean animals would die less. Many small towns or places would have less water probleams then they do know. Smart cars would do a big change in the world thanks to the oil reduce of the cars. The world would have a better way of life. I agree with smart cars because these cars would make a diffrence for everbody and for the world.  ",,,,,,,
423,923,"Throughout the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author provides quite a bit of evidence towards why human exploration of Venus should take place again. The author suggest that sending a human out to study Venus is risky, but it is worth trying to get more information about Venus itself. In the beginning of the article, the author focuses on why he thinks that it is worth the risk of sending someone out to Venus despite the risks. The authors reasoning is that it is ""Earth's 'twin'"". He further goes on to explain how Venus might have been ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". The author does an adequate job of explaining that they want humans to explore Venus because it is so similar to Earth that they want to understand why. The author does provide enough evidence to support the idea of Earth and Venus being sister planets. Towards the middle of the article, the author starts explaining the statistics of Venus and how it is now non-sustainable for living organisms. The author is providing a lot of evidence that would steer people away from wanting to send someone out to Venus to get killed. The author could try to use different evidence rather than stating how ""these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"" and that the heat mixed with the pressure ""would liquify many metals"". So far we have seen how the author has provided a lot of evidence on reasons that it would not be the least bit safe for any lliving organism to go and study up close to Venus. Later on in the article, the author starts venturing over to the ways it would possibly be safe for someone to go visit Venus. The author suggests a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above"" Venus' surface. He goes on to tell the statistics of how ""the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"". These are not the safest conditions but the author makes sure to provide the fact that they are ""survivable for humans"". The author has a great idea with a lot of evidence to back him up but there is not enough evidence. He does not state how they are planning on getting material off the surface of Venus while also keeping the humans safe and under sustainable living conditions. The author provides a paragraph on how they plan to bring electronics close to Venus without having the metal liquify. In the parahraph, the author states that they would use something called mechanical computers. Mechanical computers are something that was ""first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"". These are made up of silison carbide and would last 3 weeks in the conditions of Venus without getting destroyed. This would allow communication between Earth and the persons that are possibly in the blimp-like vehicle hovering above Venus in order to get orders and directions from The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In the end, the author includes adequate evidence as to how they plan on getting in sight of Venus, why they want to study it, how they would communicate from Venus to Earth, and the difference of pressure and temperature. The author could go on and provide more support for how the humans would be living out in space and how they would survive within those living requirements that are hardly met.","In my opinion , I say that us students should have the offer too have school projects. The examples im gonna provide is too say why we should have these projects over the summer because they can give us a topic about what we did over the summer as a project. for examples , this can bring so many students grades up and ill teach us about what each students did over the summer by looking at there project by including pictures and so many more details. Also , this will be a fun activity that everyone will enjoy around the world. In addition , you wouldnt really need summer school anymore for some other students. This can provide them too move up to the next grade level by providing them with these school projects. All you gotta do is give them a topic about what they did over summer and it can most likely make them succeed , all they gotta do is provide pictures , details , and have something too do with the subjects that they learn in school such as english , math , and science included in the project. it can bring us all together and closer as a school if we did something like this. Furthermore , you can even provide a reward when school starts again. It can be a first , second , and a third place winner , the prize should be of any students choosing such as a ten dollar gift card too their favorite fast food restaurant. this will make students want too try even harder and wanna compete with each other of who got the best and coolest project out of everyone. also , we can all get in front of the class to show off are talent and decorations too all the teachers and staff. To continue , this would be a huge opportunity too us students that we will mighty enjoy. In conclusion , I have provide details and examples on why this type of thing should happen all around the country. it can bring so many communities and schools all around the world and provided students a way too stay out of trouble and a cool activity for everyone too do as a project. hopefully staff and teachers look in too this activity cause might I say , I would enjoy too be apart off designing a project of what I did over the summer.","Dear principal, I believe students should use there cell-phones during lunch periods or other free times because it gives them a sense of freedom, and occupies their time. Student have a ton of reasons why they need to use cell-phone, but they leave out the good reasons. Some students do not choose to bring cell-phones to school, my mom makes me, just in case something happens to her or me. Now other students may have the same reasons, and we are not gonna say no to bringing our cell-phones. Some teachers may even encourage it what harm could they cell phones really do just make sure the are off in every class period, so when they walk in tell then to take out their cell-phones make the teachers check to see that they are off and go on with the call period, and if you see then confiscate them until the end of they day or until parents pick them up. I would like if you took my reasons into consideration when you make your decision on your new policy. Besides don't you want all the students to think that you are the best principal and that our school is the best ever, I know I would. Your Student, STUDENT_NAME","Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online video conferencing. It could be better for kids who have problems learning and sitting still. Some school should offer that because it could help people with anixty. People who have anixty cant deal with alot of people. They so freak out about small places and freak out of the littles things. People with depression struggle with there self they aren't confroble with body. They also stop eating or stop caring about thingd. People with depression cut there self to help with the pain. They do realize that people care about them. It could help with people sleeping. Some people dont sleep at night. They would rather sleep doing the day. It could help with people getting sick all the time. School shouldnt offer this because people wont make any friends. Kids can play sports in school. They can play soccer,baseball,softball,football bakestball,cheer,golf and wrestle. Some familys cant afford to buy food for there famliy. Some kids only get one meal a day. My school gets bags every friday and sends it home with kids so they can eat. Kids who play sports are working out and always on the go. They loose weight when they are working out. Its really good for your body. Kids wont do their homework if they arent here. Some kids learn better one on one but others dont. Some kids are hands on and others are verbial learns. When kids get kick out they do work online. Some kids do collage classes. some kids get to leave school early for work but they are taking that a way. Some school offer distance learing as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I dont think it is a good idea at all. Kids will get in trouble and other things. I dont like school that much but it keeps me safe durning the day. Im glad i have this to learn from. ","Luke Bomberger had his life changed for the better when he joined the Seagoing Cowboys. He had the pleasure of exploring the world and helping many nations in need. You could help the world too if you helped out the cowboys. Luke shows that you have the chance to explore new places and meet new people when you are helping this cause. Luke got to travel all the way to China and he explored Venice, Italy. Luke also had the privelege of playing tournaments and various games on board of the cattle boat with his colleagues. You could make new friends and lend a helping hand with UNRAA. One of the hardships of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having to take care of livestock. Luke provides information that it takes alot of hard work to maintain these animals. Some of the jobs that have to be done include cleaning pens, feeding the livestock, and getting them water. Even though this all seems like too much work, it still pays off with having the feeling of knowing you helped someone's life. A final reason that you should join this program is that it shows hope that the world could be a better place for every nation. These people are helping provide food to citizens' lives who were affected by war. This shows a ray of sun shine to people who aren't lucky enough to have a home or food. It shows these people that they will be helped. If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you could make someone out there feel like this. The cowboys out on the sea are helping lives become better out in the harsh world. They are providing food for the hungry, and they are making miserable lives great. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.","Do you think technology reading your emotion is valuable? In this esaay I'm going to be talk about three things; do I think using technology to read your emotional expression is valuable, what are some pro's and con's of this technology, and lastly will this change the your behaivor. What are your thoughts of facial reconition? Do it think using technology to read your emotional experssion is valuable? I think it could be valuable but also it's not really needed. If you watch YouTube a lot then you might like it because if you don't like the ad you can frown and the next time you won't watch the same ad and you might like that ad. Do you think it is valuable or a waste of time and money? What are pro's and con's about this technology? There are many pro's and con's of this like how much it could cost and if it will even work. I have mixed feeling about this. I think it could be useful when you watch a lot of videos because you won't be watching the same ad over and over again. It could also be useful because it could communicate with you and help you out when you are sad by playing a funny video are give you a couple jokes. It could change your day from a bad day into a good day. There are some con's too. I think this would cost a lot of money and would take a long time to make every thing perfect. If they make one computer work that solution that you came up with the last one might mot work for a different computer. Also if they finally figure the system out then it will be costly to buy it. I wouldn't by a expensive computer if all that is different is that it tells if you like an ad or not. I think it is a waste of money. Also since this technology has an video imagery, I think that a stocker could easly hack into this and stock people. Do you think that this is a waste of money or do you think this is a good idea? Would this technolgy change your behavior? According to the artical it said it that it will change someones feeling or emotion. I think that it could change your behavior because it won't show the same ad over and over. I think that if this emotion recognize didn't work then I would be mad people you wasted a lot of money on this technology. Would your behavior change if you had this kind of technology? What would you do with this kind of technology?

Im for these new cars I think it would make things alot easier for some driver's that get nervous and are not paying attenion to the road. It would be useful when your driver by an accident or proventing a accident driving by an construction site. It would kind be like taking a taxi or bus but not have worry about having to call and get a taxi or missing the bus and or finding a seat on the bus. In article it states thier cars have driven half a mile without a crash but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless ; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. The cars have been proven that they are caoable of driving witout crashing but there not fully capable of drivering by thereself. In the article it states Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position -estimating sensors on rear wheel. rotating sensor on the roof a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver , and an inertial motion sensor. That can help alot with people not checking the driveway as there sometimes late for work of just in a rush to get somewhere. In conclusion i feel like the car would be a great help to people everwhere. It could stop alot of accident's and it help in traffic.",,,,,,,
337,109,"Cell Phones and Driving Should you be permitted to drive a vehicle while using a device? In this case you shouldn't because it comes with many risks while you're on the road. You put yourself in danger while putting other drivers in danger as well. You risk your life with others on the line too!!!! To begin with it's a big distraction on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers. You tend to check your phone so much which can cause you to crash with someone else. But also take the focus of your surroundings while driving. It takes your focus away from safe driving. One single text can make a blink of an eye change your life of someone else's life. Also when you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. It also takes your hands off the steering wheel to answer one single text. Another reason that driving while using a device should be allowed is because it is illegal. You get pulled over and get a ticket. But also if caught many times can cause those digits tickets to go up which means big money tickets. It can also rise in auto insurance rates. It can lead up to prison time as well .Is it worth risking your freedom? More so, is it worth the emotional damage a car accident causes to everyone involved? Also it leads to getting your license suspended. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another one of the most serious driving offenses which is a DUI. A third reason that using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed is because it can have huge risks. Sending or replying to a text requires that you remove at least one hand from the steering wheel so that you can grip your phone and thumb in a reply. So not only are you multitasking and not focusing your eyes from the road, but you're also trying to deftly use your phone with one hand while at the same time steer your vehicle. So not only do you risk crashing with other vehicles but also losing the steering wheel which is the control of driving the vehicle. Being able to use a device while operating a vehicle shouldn't be allowed. It brings too many risks and changes to the environment of driving. There would be a lot of accidents on the highway due to having access to a device while driving. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children. It is every driver's responsibility to always be careful and attentive, ensuring everyone can safely get from Point A to Point B. Which is why driving with a device on your hand shouldn't be allowed.                  ","""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? They started coming up with new ideas on how to make cars work better. Most people like me are fascinated with cars that can drive themselves . Who wouldn't want a car that could do that? It sounds like a good idea but there are some things most people wouldn't like about these cars. The cars that already have been created are not completely driverless. That means you still have to pay full attention when the car is working by itself. Google had a car that could drive half a million miles without crashing but it still wasn't driverless . The driver gets notified when pulling in and out of driveways. The Google cars would also alert the driver incase of a accident or roadwork . Some of the cars made had sensors in them. The sensors would allow a much better respond than the human drivers . BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" had a sensor that would make sure the driver had hold of the wheel. Most of the cars developed so far couldn't really do much but steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. The human driver still had to remain alert incase they had to take over and start driving in case of an accident or roadwork ahead . So why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? They think the idea of it is fun , which it is . Most laws about driving are focused on keeping the people in the vehicle safe. New laws will be made incase there is an accident . They will have to see whos fault is it- the driver or the manufacturer . Would you still want a car that you had to drive? Doesn't really sound like a good idea to me . Sounds fun but it's a lot of work .","Would you travel to a dangerous enviorment just to unravel the unknown ? if your answer was ""no"", then you are like most normal people. but, the author of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus"" wouldn't take ""no"" as a answer. This author believes that the discovery of the true venus , hidden from the naked eye, will benfit the future of science, even with the danger staring them in their face. The author believes that Venus is special because , it's basically the ""twin"" of earth, which means they might have had life on the surface. According to paragraph 4 it states ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""(TCOEV), Which fueled the minds of the scientists , because they just wanna know what was on the surface of venus. But, with a goal there is also road bumps, one of them is the fact that venus enviorment is crucial. According to paragraph 3 it states venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus ... temperatures average over 800 degress...liquefy many metals.""(TCOEV), which is extremely dangerous. But later in the article they stated ""venus have value...expandes to meet very edges of imagination and innovation"" which show that they can gain knowledge in later visits, and advance their technolgy. The author of 'The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" explaines why studying Venus is helpful in many ways. Even though you might say ""what if the people get injured or possibly die"" he provided details of how there is many diffrent ways they can carry out the mission. So, next time that you are setting a just never give up , even if you come cross a challege.

It's World War II in Europe and many countrys are in ruins. They need help taking care of their animals and shiping them over seas. Luke and Don signed up. ""We arrived August 14,"" Luke said. They where traveling over the Pacific ocean and going to Greece with 335 horses and food for them. Luke turned 18 before they got there and wanted to sign up for tthe military service. ""By the time be was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips, the most of the Seagoing Cowboys."" Luke loved this new life of cattle-boat trips and helping people. On his free time be would explore Europe even more. It took him 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the United States and then a month to get to China. Caring for the animals kept Luke busy and they where fed and watered two or tree times a day, and stalls had to be cleaned. Luke has had some training on Katie's farm as a small boy and helped him where he is now. ""Luke also found time to have fun on board."" Luke said. There is many things to do on the ship such as baseball, vollyball and table-tennis. Luke did Seagoing Cowboys for many year later and loved every bit of it.","I strongly disagree. Because students should focus on there education not on yearbook or on some other activities at school. I agree that sports keep as fit and healthy. But is sport worth as our education? NO! right then why do you guys want's as to participate in sports, making the yearbook,or other activities like this. WHY? if we give more time to sports or other activities our education can fall back our grades can drop down. Teachers and parents want work from as is we give time to other activities at school then we won't have much time for our homework,projects, and our tests. When we ask the teachers do you accept late work they say no. This is when we say no to other activities at school. Because if they do not accept late work then we have to do it on time it's due to get better grads. Just focus on your education and move on you can do sports later in life but you can't de educated later. This is your time learn something be something. What would you say next time when your teacher asks you for participating in school activity would you say yes or no?","There are lots of pros and cons when discussing teacher designed summer projects or student designed summer projects. Some pros of teacher based summer projects would be, there's help whenever its needed, more motive to work harder since the teacher is pushing you. On the other hand, the cons would be simply paying the teacher a lot of money to work with the student. One could argue that the teacher would be willing to do it for free, however that is economically irrational we have to assume everyone is rational. Although having a teacher based summer project would be very assisting to the students, the socially optimal route would be the student based summer project. In today's society, there's lots of ""hand holding"" with students and they arent able to adjust to the real world lifestyle as easily as they could be. Forcing students in the habit of being independent is beneficial because when these students have to go to college and get a real job later in life, they'll be familiar with the situation and they'll know how it feels so that way the amount of stress put on them is minimized. Kids working student based will also help them not rely on getting help from a teacher all the time and they'll be able to learn material in class with less assistance. These students will exit the project with more applicable skills that they will carry on for the rest of their lives. In the aspect of economics, hypothetically if the program is teacher based, then these teachers will need to be compensated for their tutoring. For every single student to have a teacher beside them would be a lot of money spent by the school. The argument could be made that the teacher would do it for free, however that is unlikely since they're on summer vacation. In the long run, the alternative of having the kids do these problems by themselves without teachers is the best route for them to develop in dependency and have the school save some money. Detoxing and having time off is important for teachers too, not just students. In the event that a student gets stuck on a question and doesnt know how to solve it, there are solutions. The student can ask his/her parent to help them or, the teachers that are on summer vacation can make videos of how to solve the problems that are assigned on the project. If one teacher makes one video that explains everything, then that saves everyone the time and money. instead of every teacher being assigned to a student and have them work it out, one teacher can make a video that helps all without them even being there! In conclusion, the student based project would be most beneficial to society in the aspect of economics and independence of the students. While the students persevere and develop skills of independence, the teachers can enjoy their summer break free of distractions. The summer assignments all students across America must complete are merely assignments to keep us ready for the school year, therefore teachers dont need to be involved in assignments that arent meant for students to accel in. The students will return to the classroom far better off with the student based project as opposed to the teacher based project.       ","Here, in the United States, birthplace of the Model T,driving has proven to be part of our history and culture.  However, with recently uncovered developments in our environment such as global warming and pollution, it is time for us to re-evaluate our ""car culture"".  Overusage has proven harmful and limiting alternatives that reduce stress, are just as effective in getting us from point 'A' to 'B' and are more eco-friendly. Our excessive car usage is dramatically hurting our environment.  In fact, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (5).  What people use for our short term convenience is actually proving inconvenient for us in the long run.  In Paris, there was ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London"" (17).  The culprit?  Diesel fuel emissions from transportation (cars).  To underscore the severity, the smog in Paris is so bad that French Officials had to limit car usage in a smog cloaked city that ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""(14). This issue is mirrored in Bogota, Columbia, where the government has also stepped in and established a car free day in which perpetrators get fined in order to "" promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (21).  Efforts such as these can be effective in aiding our environmental crisis.  After France also instated a limit on car usage ""the smog cleared"" (19).  By limiting our car usage we can actually make a difference in reducing pollution and make our living environment more pleasant and healthier. The switch is facilitated further not only by the inclination toward a better worldy environment but a less stressful social one as well.  In the city of Vauban in Germany, residents have "" given up their cars""(1).  Here although car ownership is allowed, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move [there]."" (3).  Do the residents regret their decision?  According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two:  ""When I had a car I was always tense, I am much happier this way""(3).  In Bogota, a business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza who participates in Bogota's movement to reduce car usage says that the absence of cars is an ""...opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (24).  These are two individuals on different continents with families and busy lives who find the lack of cars to be not a handicap but actually a source of stress relief.  In France, after the restrictions of car usage the streets also became less stressful for people who have to drive (like taxi drivers or public transporters) because of a ""60 percent reduction in traffic congestion"" (14). For those who do decide to make a move to help the environment and themselves by reducing their car usage, their are more and more alternatives that are making their switch worthwhile.  In Vauban, you can hear the sounds of viable alternatives in use.  The ""swish of bicycles"" and the ""chatter""(3) of walking children is audible in the streets.  Carlos Arturo Plaza rides the car-free streets of Bogota on "" atwo seat bicycle with his wife""(24).  For those who don't feel comfortable with walking or cycling other options such as carpool exist and governments are now making more of an effort to make other alternatives such easier and more available ( i. e. public transportation).  In Bogota, in order to support the movement toward less automobile driving wide sidewalks have been made.  In Vauban the whole city has been constructed with the goal to make everything compact and easier to access by foot or bike.  This is good news for those who make the early morning busness commute as their job is closer to where they live and more convenient to walk or bike to than other suburbs in which commuters are forced to take the high way because of the distance.  Also, the more people who take advantage of whatever public transportation available to them will make the demand higher and cause more funding to be placed on public transportation.  Before ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport""(9), but with more usage, this can change. Essentially, the sacrifice of some of our car usage is far outweighed by the positive affects on our environment and attitudes.  Plus new systems that cater to better alternative uses make the switch easier than ever!!                           ",,,,,,,

Activities outside of school can be a good thing if they are willingly done by the person, compared to being forced into doing an activity. Studies have shown that if someone is forced into doing a selected activity, they wouldn't enjoy it as much as they would compared to the person doing the activity willingly. Some student's already are doing things outside of school such as, helping at their local food bank, volunteering at their church, or they could just be leading a small study group. There are some student's out there that aren't interested in doing anything outside of school either because they can't or they just don't want to do anything after dismissal time. For some student's, activities outside of school could really help their social skills by exposing them to a new environment, with new people, and new challenges to face. In conclusion doing things outside of school could be a good thing for students if they do it willingly and if there are many options to choose from,not just activities associated with school, but continuous activities in the community too. When doing activities outside of school there can be many things to choose from. Some activities that student's can get involved in outside of school may include volunteering at a local non-profit, organizing a study group, or it could be as simple as doing a sport, the possibilities are virtually endless! If your'e principal made it so that the extracurricular activity was some how associated with school, there are still plenty of options out there. Some activities that may be associated with your'e local school may include sports, yearbook club,National Junior Honor Society, or even a chess club, there is still a lot you can do after school, but not as many activities you could do that isn't associated with school. There are some districts that have already implemented this into their schools, which for most of the schools they had to add more clubs that fit the students interests. A resent study shows that the students who did extracurricular activities preformed better on a social IQ test compared to students who didn't do any activities outside of school. If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, thats why it would be best if the school system stayed the same with a few minor changes to the systems. Activities can be healthy for students, if the students like what they are doing. Students may not want to do things after school, except to just go home. While there are some kids who absolutely love to do things outside of school because it can be a good social experience for them. A survey recently done by a New York institute, seventy five percent of the time when teens are forced into something they resent and do the opposite of what is told of them. To sum every thing up, The school systems should allow the students to have free choice of what they do, schools need to make the kids of tomorrow more independent and allow them to choice their own path of what they want to do.","Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College. Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President. Remember the election between Obama and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winner-take-all"" basis. For every slight of pulrality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoral-vote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College. Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election. If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.    ","Dear principal, As we all know you are reconsidering the schools cell phone policy. The policy's that you are thinking of are A. Allow students to use cell phones during free times and lunch periods, and B. No cell phones at school at all. I think that you should choose policy A. I think you should choose policy A for 3 reasons. The first reason you should choose policy A is communication. Communication is my first reason because some students need to arrange plans that take place after school with their parents or other adults. some students may need to do this because they could be staying after school and need to arrange a ride with a parent or adult as soon as possible. Communication is also my first reason because if a student needs something for class they can ask their parent to drop it off during free time or lunch. This is why communication is my first reason. My second reason is long term projects. long term projects is my second reason because now most students have phones that are advanced enough that they can hold files that are important to a project that can be edited on the phone. Another reason I choose long term projects is because most phones now have e-mail and during free time or lunch you can e-mail a partner new information about the project to your partner if they are sick so they can still do their part of the project. This is why long term projects is my second reason. The third reason I choose is schedules. This is my third reason because most cell phones can create schedules and planners and when a student gets a free time or lunch, they can plan out their week and plan when homework is due and when to start projects. Another reason I choose this is because some students might lose their agenda book and have to move it on to their phone. please take my reasons into consideration","The creation of ""smart cars"" is new and exciting, but is it safe? Multiple car companies are working on cars that drive themselves. Tesla claimes that they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time by 2016. Also Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Google has had cars that have been on the road independently since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, so far. Google cars arn't truly independent, they are required to have a person in the car to take the wheel in case of simply pulling in or out of a driveway or complicated traffic issues. In most states it is illegal to even test the computer driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the Dristrict of Columbia have led the country in allowing the use of semi-autonomous cars. It should be illegal in most states, because it is dangerous. If one of these ""smart cars"" were to crash who is responsible? The driver,the car company, or the state? New laws will be needed to cover liability incase of an accident, in these states before the cars are tested. All of these ""smart cars"" that have been created, and are on the road still need a person in the car. Why would someone want a driverless car that needs someone in it? All these big name car companies are claming to have these ""driverless cars"" soon, but how safe is it going to be for states, and pedestrians on the streets? If these ""smart cars"" are created, states need to make sure that the cars are 100% safe for everyone.  ","Have you ever asked advice from anyone? How many times have you asked? Asking advice is pretty important if you're one of those people that depend on people to make your decisions. But why should we ask multiple people for advice? Well lets start off by how advice is important. Advice is a suggestion or recommendation that a person gives to you in order help in your decision-makings. It can affect your life greatly by which choices you make. So that's why it's important to get feedback from multiple people. Once you have gathered information from other people, you can compare other people's responses with others to see what would be good or bad. One example was when I asked my friends which sports I should play. I came up to at least 10 or more of my friends for advice. Then I compared some answers with others. And it seems that a lot of people thought I was good a Basketball. So I tried it out, and it was the perfect sports for me. But still, why should we ask multiple people for advice? We rely on others everyday in our lives. Either by life choices or just helping people. There are many ways to help people, but we mostly help people with advice. Asking several different people is a great way to get advice. You could ask you parents, friends, uncles, anybody! Recently, I went on a trip to the mountains. I was either deciding if I wanted to ski or snowboard when I got there. Wasn't sure of my decisions, I asked my family members and friends. out of 8, 6 said skiing because it was easy and it was my first time. So I agreed. Opinions can vary when asking many different people. It's good to ask for many different opinions. Otherwise you won't come out with a good outcome. Another example could be during science class. Sometimes you have to try the experiment 50 times in order to make your final outcome or decision. Why should we ask multiple people for advice? How does it benefit you? As a result of asking many people for their opinion, many people have matured in life making better choices. This benefits us as a person when we grow up to make our own decisions. So that's why advice can really be important in tough choices. So always try to get advice from your peers when you need it.","Venus is often called the ""Evening Star"" for being the brighest points of light. It's also the second planet close to the sun. And as it's simple to see from distant, it proved a very challenging place for examining closely. It's very worthy even though Venus's thick atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide. But getting through the clouds are worse with them being sulfuric acid as a high danger sign for spaceships to only be there for a few hours. The temperature has scortching heat of 800 degrees fahrenheit and 90 times more pressure than our planet. Venus has impediments of erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes to anything landing on it's surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may once of been like Earth with oceans and various forms of life. The Astronomers think it's a good idea to kepp trying to land on Venus even though their spaceships never last more than a few hours and believe there might be various life forms like Earth and some oceans. But Venus is to deadly with acid, scortching heat, and 90 times our pressure that could crush a submarine. Also Venus has some lighting that strikes anything landing on it's surface and erupting volcanoes with frequent earthquakes. Venus also has a surface of rocky sediments with valley's, mountains, and craters under the clouds and atmosphere. People have tried sending multiple spaceships to Venus but they never came back. It was the brightest ""Evening Star"" but the most dangerous planet with sulfuric acid atmosphere. Astronomers know the dangers of going to Venus but want think theres life form and oceans like Earth. If anything was to land on it's surface, lightning would strike it and the spacecraft could only last a few hours if lucky. My conclusion to this is that Venus is a dangerous place but I would like to see whats on that planet, and know if there really is any life form or oceans. If so the astronomers might take some life from there adn water to bring and test what it actually is. But they can't send people into acid atmospheres and scortching heat just to land on Venus.","Can we actually "" calculate"" emotions like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movments we humans use to express how we feel? I think if we had technoligy like this to see emotional expressions if students that would sovle a lot of problems. It tells someone how they are feeling without using words. Yes I do think it's valuable but at the same time I dont agree with it because theres such a thing called privcy and I dont with anyone wants to be read like a book because if the world sees us all as the same no one would be special. At the same time no one can tell you how your feeling beside ourself and I don't think a computer could tell the full story. I know thats not all the feelings in mona Lisa's face, there ahs to be more to it, there always is. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists but what if they are wrong? We don't know for sure, we just relie on people who tell us what we want to believe and we have no choice but to believe them. There is more to emotions then just happiness, suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness. What about curiosity, passion, stress, guilt, excitment and etc but you get the point.",,,,,,,
904,109,"I have read the article of ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' When I imagine that if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. First of all,in September,1997,one of the chief scientist man said ''When they arrived at the Red Planet,''We felt this was important to taxpayer. A few days later NASA was unveiled the image for all to see.''Jim Garvin also say that ''We photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.'' Which mean they were trying to shot a picture of the Face that they saw in Mars. Second,on April 5,1998,when Cydonia was for the first times,the two men had snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. It revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. When the Face was located it was in April a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. One man said ''Alien markings were hidden by haze.'' After that,the mission trying to look again. In April 8,2001 a cloudless summer a day in Cydonia,Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Garvin said ''We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.''Malin's team also captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.''The image of 2001 spans like 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters in the best of 1976 Viking's photo. Finally,Garvin said that ''If there were objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were.''he said. Lastly,the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American Wests.''That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.''After all that happened nobody was not really sure which one was the right one.                 ","I think driverless cars would be a very cool thing to have. Also its outside the box not every car can be driverless but some can. Just look a lamborghini or ferrari they dont have as much technology as some of the newer middle class cars do. But your paying $500,000 for some thing that doesnt have as many features as a prius or a smart car. But also driverless cars arent really driveless if some has to take the wheel and go around some things that means the cars not really driveless I would rather drive my car than let a computer beacuse technology will always have problems and errors and if that happens gonig down a highway at say 70mph and your car has a problem and you aren't ready for it you may end up in the hospital. Driverless cars will happen one day but not anytime soon cause some states say they arent even legal to drive a computer operated car.","Many people have at least one activity that they love, care about, or are passionate about. School helps many kids find out their strengths and weaknesses. I believe that our school should make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. This will benefit students tremendously. If these activities can help students expand their social skills, get new opportunities, and let them have some fun at school, then I think our schools should have this requirement. First, we are going to talk about one of the reasons why the students should be required to be part of at least one extracurricular activity. That reason is sociability. If someone that is shy joins a club that they are interested in, they might talk more because they are in their element and where they feel the safest. Being in a club can also give kids the opportunity to make new friends. Students can learn social skills from working in groups within the club, or working with the whole club. Students might feel like they fit in more if they are in an activity where mostly everyone has a common interest. Depending on the club, there are multiple different ways that doing an extracurricular activity can help a student expand their social skills. New opportunities and getting to explore different interests are a great benefit of doing an extracurricular activity. Students can learn about something they never knew existed. One time I was at a camp and they made us choose an activity that we wanted to try. I chose wood burning, and I had a learned a plethora of things that I did not know before. If the camp had never made me choose something to do, I would have never learned about wood burning. This very closely relates with the extracurricular activities. Students can get exposure to different types of activities, and may even find a new hobby that they enjoy. Next, we will talk about the third reason why I believe that we should make the activity mandatory. The third reason why students should have to do an activity is so they can have fun. For many kids, school is work and stress. If they have a club to look forward to at the end of the day, it can make school more enjoyable, and maybe even more fun. It is also relaxing to have an activity that you get to do with your friends, and not worry about homework or tests. Some extracurricular activities may have fun projects or activities to do that students can enjoy. If a student is doing an activity that they enjoy or have an interest in, then it is likely that they will be having fun. Having fun, learning new social skills, and exploring different clubs/activities are just some of the many reasons why our school should make extracurricular activities mandatory. These activities can lead students through a journey of self-discovery, and can benefit most of the students. I think it is the right choice to make all students do an extracurricular activity, and doing so will let kids enjoy some of the things that they care about and are passionate about.","Dear Mr. Senator: The Electoral College has been around for quite some time. It has aided us in the election of the president for years. Is it truly fair though? Are the right votes being expressed? Whilst the Electoral College has a history for determining and appointing the president, I believe that it is not quite fair as it doesn't use the direct votes of the people, the slate of electors have the ability to defy the will of the people, and the voting system just isn't fair. To start off, in this system of voting, the actual votes of the people aren't used. The people vote for a slate of electors who in turn vote for the president. These electors can be appointed by state conventions, the state party's central committee, or even the presidential canidates themselves. These electors may be chosen and then paid to vote for a certain canidate and therefore swinging their decision to an obvious bias. This is quite troubling as when it comes down to the actual counted vote, it really isn't the will of the people as a whole, it's the will of those few electors who have the ability to vote for the other canidate rather than the one they are chosen to vote for. That being said, the electors that are chosen may have been chosen for a certain canidate, but are payed off to vote for the other. Though this is unlawful, it is a possibility. The people vote for these people rather than the president themselves, so the decision rests on this slate of electors. Should they change their mind on who they want to vote, or should they be paid in someway, they could defy the will of the greater people who have voted for them. Having established that it is not the actual vote of the people, but a slate of electors electing the president, the number of actual votes do not go towards the president. Though a canidate may have the highest number of popular votes, if they do not have the highest number of electorial votes, they are not going to win. I believe this isn't right as the votes for the president should come directly from the poeple. If a canidate has the highest amount of popular votes, I believe that canidate is the one that should be appointed president because it is the greater people that favour them. In closing, I believe that the of the Ellectoral College should be abolished as it isn't the vote of the poeple being used, the slate of electors always has the ability to defy the greater will of the people, and the over all system just isn't fair. There are many kinks to this process that I believe direct voting will take care of. I acknowledge that such a transition would be quite the lengthy process, but I would like to see the change happen. Wouldn't you like to see the actual voice of the people expressed? Thank you for your time and I truly hope you take my words into concideration, PROPER_NAME                    ","Should summer projects be teacher or student designed? Doing projects over the summer are great for memory. Are also fun to do because it is a hands on activity to do over the summer. Learning and understanding are reasons on why teacher-designs are great fro summer projects. One reason, on why teacher-designs are great for summer projects is learning. Learning from the teacher's design over the summer is best because going into a new school year will help when going over the topic. Another example, on why learning from the teacher's design over the summer is perfect fro what the teacher wants you to talk about over summer break. Their is another reason on why a teachers design is better. Another reason, on why teacher-designs are great for summer projects is understanding it. Understanding the teacher's example is perfect for making your own. The reason why the teacher's give out an example is to understand the layout of what they want you to do. Some people would argue over why a students design is better. Some people would say that, doing a student- designed project over the summer is better because it's easier to understand. The teacher's design is better than the student design because it gives a layout on what the student needs to do and put on their project. In conclusion, learning and understanding are reasons why teacher's give out their own design for students over the summer. If I had a project over the summer I would use the teachers- design to help me out.","Luke's life changed after high school graduation because of a friend named Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. And luke went cause he couldn't say no. It was and oppertunity of a life time to him. So he did travel to Europe. Before then Luke had two part-time jobs in agrocery store and a bank when Don Reist invited hom to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Many countries were left in ruins no food no supplies for them to live off of. So 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). Hired,""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young cows and the mules that were going over the sea. Luke and Don signed up for the ""Seagoing Cowboys."" To help the countrys that were left in ruins because they needed food to survive. And Luke signed up and he said it was awsome to help the countrys that were in need of food and shelter. The seagoing cowboys traveled far across the sea to help countrys in need, they even went to China, and it took a month to get there. Luke had fun being a seagoing cowboy. It took 2 weeks to get to the United States, and a month to get to China. Carrying animals during the crossings kept luke busy. But Luke was ready because helping out at aunt Katies farm prepared him for the journey ahead. On Lukes second trip Luke served as a night watchman. And he cracked his ribs sliding down the stairs. but Luke also found fun things on the board they did baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games helped pass the time. being a seagoing cowboy was more of than a adventure to Luke Bomberger a world was opened to him. Luke was grateful for the oppertunity of being a seagoing cowboy, and the awreness stayed with him, while leading his family a number of of international students and exchange visitors for many years.","I think the students should be able to choose whether they want to do community service or not because not everybody is in shape to do alot of things around the community because they could have had surgery or their bones might be to weak to be walking around all the time, and if they have things wrong with them like that then you should not make them have to do that and be up all the time walking around and doing everything for you that you don't want to do and they should not have to do that as specially if you don't want to do it and say that your not going to do it then why even say that they have to or even try to make it a law that everybody has to do it except for adults and we have enough to worry about like our school work getting chores done at home and taking care of ourselves and our pets, so that don't give us any time to do community service unless we want to and if we have free time to do and if that was to ever happen then it should at least be only twice a week and we should be able to pick the days then we should be able to get a sheet of paper so that way we can write down what we picked up from around the community and then each piece of trash we pick up should be some kind of bonus and the same if we were to help people out like say they needed help loading up the groceries in the car and they couldn't do it all by themselves and that is my opinion. I am pretty sure that alot of other teenagers would think the same exact thing and if the principle tried to make it any longer i think that everybody would go on strike.",,,,,,,
644,109,"Professor Thomas Huang has a initiative way of finding out how someone is feeling. ""New computer software that can recognize emotions"", some may view it as an invasion of privacy, or just straight up weird. I believe it could be a new way to not only help but to recognize your own feelings or your persona to others. As we speak about the new invention I'd like to mention how it works. ""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"", there are 44 major muscles in the model that move like a human muscle for accuracy. Someone who is not only an expert with technology works on these but also someone who is an expert in mood, stability, etc works through these. ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman."" ""There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness......"" These emotions are ""calculated"" per say by looks, movements, and the facial muscles. This could help dictate the feelings of someone who is unable to speak or vocalize. Now ""putting on a happy face"" is actually possible.","Its always a good idea to be participating in after school or in school activities. A really good time to start would be in middle or high school. The reasons for it being a good idea is it gives experience for the future,helps prepare you for the future and helps you figure out what you like. First things first getting experience is very critical to do before leaving school and going into the big world. Its good for applying to jobs and generally preparing for what you could do. This could ,also help by showing you what you might be good at that you didnt know you where or help you to get better if your not good at something or dont know how too do something. Participating in after school or even in school activities could help give you just that. It will really help for future events. Next thing is that participating in school activities could prepare you for the future. It doesnt seem like a big deal to be participating in school activities, but it is. Knowing and learning more things about different things outside of school gives you options for what you could do n the future. it also gives a chance to learn about things you might need to use in the future. This also gives a good idea of what it might be like in the future and could very much help along the way. Lastly participating in school activities helps you learn about you. school activities are there for that reason knowing what you like is the most important thing. knowing who might wanna be someday is also important. these activities are there to help you figure that out by finding out what you like and who you wanna hang out with , and how you work etc. what you like doing is apart of these activities and what they are made for. In conclusion knowing more about you, getting experience and preparing for the the future arent bad things to start doing. participating can simply change your future. This can change who you become and effect what you do one day. You might even find that what you thought you wanted to do or who you wanted to be you dont want that anymore. so next time you have a chance to try something new or start participating in something that you have been wanting to do, do it . it could change the future of you.                  ","The dangers of using a phone while driving Drivers should not be able to use their cell phones while they are driving. So many things can happen you can get in a car accident and lose your life or take someone else's life. There shouldn't be any reason to use your phone in the first place, your eyes should focus on the road only. Driving is no joke you have to worry about everyone around you. It is the person's job who is behind the wheel to make sure everything is safe. Driving itself is a dangerous thing to do and using a phone as well is not a smart thing to do. Cell phones can make you not focus on what's around you when you are in the vehicle. Cell phone use while operating a vehicle has became a leading cause of car crashes over two decades. Using cell phones increases the drivers risk of causing a car crash drivers attend to get distracted while picking up the phone. Awareness is key when on the road drivers who don't have awareness leads to accidents. The police can pull you over if they see you using a cell Phone there can be some serious consequences if a police officer pulls you over. It is almost common for someone to crash while they are on their phone. The only time you can use your phone is if you got into an accident or when you get out the vehicle to go somewhere. Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is mostly considered dangerous due to distracted driving and crashes. Voice calling can also cause accidents because the person is focused on talking to the person instead of focusing on driving. People should just stop using their phones 24-7 and just put the phone down. A phone call can always wait until you reach your destination or when you get out of the vehicle. You don't want to get a ticket over being on your cell phone because cops are always watching to see if you are on a phone. So next time when you get inside a vehicle you should not use a cell phone it is dangers and dumb. If you get a phone call just wait until you are safe or when you are away from others so you wont make them be in danger. Your life is worth more than just a phone call we have lost way to many people over this and it's time to make a change.         ","Dear principal, I think that kids should only be able to use there cell-phone if there is an emergency or before school they can use it or after school that's the only time kids should be able to use their phone. If they do take it into school they should keep it in there locker or off in there pockets if they bring it into class. I think this is a great idea because kids could just pull it out of there pocket and start using it when the teacher is not looking or paying attention. For example kids in my school play with there phones when the teacher is not paying attention or looking then they laugh about what's on there phone so then the teacher has to stop teaching and r remove the phone from the kids and then the teacher keeps it till the end of the day. Then the kids mom or dad has to come to school to get it from the teacher. In my school if you get caught with a phone the principal takes it and calls your parents to come to school and get the phone from the office. If my mom had to come and get my phone she would take it home and put it somewhere i couldn't find it then I would be grounded for a month. Then when I would get it back I would have to put in my locker so i wouldn't get it taken away again. Just like in the video I watched before I had to do this writing piece some kid was using his phone when the teacher wasn't looking and kids open a book and then use there phone inside the book and text somebody so the teacher doesn't know what they are doing. From, STUDENT_NAME      ","The future is coming at an alarming rate. Driverless cars are not just ideas anymore. They are being manufactured and tested at this very moment. Driverless cars can be seen as both good and bad, but I do not think they are good for society just yet. For cars to be driverless, they would have to be able to respond quickly to anything, at anytime. They would also need to possess a faster reaction time than humans. If all of these features were put into a car, then it is no longer a car; it is a robotic machine, capable of making decisions that could mean life or death of the passengers and nearby pedestrians. However, as of now, cars are still not entirely driverless. We do not yet have the technology to manufacture cars that have the human qualities that are necessary in driving, such as natural reflexes to avoid obstacles blocking the path. The world we live in today is not the same world we lived in yesterday, or the world we will live in tomorrow. The technology we currenetly have is progressing at an alarming speed. Today it's smart cars, tomorrow it's smart houses, and the next day it's smart people. Technology is a good thing, but humans are so fixated on making everything bigger and better that they forget how good it is now. What will come of the human population if we solely rely on techonolgy and not each other? If driverless cars become the sole transportation for short distances over land, then humans will not find a need to work on their hand- eye coordination and reflexes. If that were to happen, then people will start to lose those motor functions. With the speedy progression of technology, humans are slowly beginning to devolve. With the production of smart phones and other tablets, humans have shorter attention spans than their ancestors. I, personally, am against driverless cars because they will help further society into a pit of technology that no one will be able to escape. With these smarter cars, we are leaving our lives in the hands of technology, and it won't stop there. The future is coming with all new toys and gadgets to make our lives ""simpler"" and ""easier"", but who wants the boring life of everything being handed to them?                         ","My opinion is that we should study venus. Yes, it might be dangerous but if you would want to find out more about venus then that's the option. ""Researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" We wouldn't be able to see it far away. We would need to see it close up so we would be able to study and explore it. Venus has something we want to learn about, not specifically that but about it. It has so many things that we want to see and study. ""Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us."" Venus is the hottest even if it's not the closest to the sun. ""Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Studying venus would be much better. We would know more about venus and it is. We would know what it has and what don't it have. ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" Some of venus features are unknown but some are analogous to those on earth. ""NASA's possible solution to the hositle conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" ""Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky."" Venus is the second planet from our sun. We are curious what venus has and study it. It has so many things that earth dosen't. It's a whole different planet. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus."" It might be dangerous but one day we will get to go to venus. NASA is trying there hardest to get a person to venus but we need more materials and money for that. Almost 3 decades we haven't went to venus. It's a challenge to study and get back. NASA will complete this challenge. ","Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll. He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Along his trip he got chance to visit many places. He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was. He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy. He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean. Helping on his aunt Katie's farm when he was young had prepared luke for hard work. In the story it tells you of a man named Luke Bomberger and what he did as a Seagoing Cowboy. It doesn't really try to convince you to participate in the program but if you do you can get some details from what he did to what you might do if you joined. After this program he said ""it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" ",,,,,,,
100,109,"Phones and Driving Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic   ","Dear Principal, I'm writing this letter to inform you that Cell phone at lunch should be okay and all of the free times that we have. While school is going on. Texting in class will keep the children's and teen's from learning on what the teachers are trying to teach them. And if i was the teacher i would have done made the rule of teacher letting the students text friend's during school as in lunch, or free times between classes. when there in the hall's. For the thought that if your in class then your not lurning much of anything but putting text messages in your head. On the other side of why it's not a good ideal of student's having phones in school is because most people are nothing but drama. As in they will start conflicts and always' need to go and see you. Most students that have cell phones all they are doing on them is starting drama because when one person gets a text message then theirs going to be another student getting the drama shown on there phone so for and so on. Cell phone's travel as in the text message one person and can tell you something very sad and you don't want anyone else knowing but your friend. Then if you and your friend get into a fight then there's going to be Drama with in you and your old friend you all will get into a big fight. All texting in ways is drama because people are childish in all kinds of ways harassment, bulling. Then theirs way's that I can see why teacher and you don't want the students to have there cell phones out any place at school is because of the internet students get on facebook, or anything that can get people starting in with drama. The facebook can lead to harassment, and bulling just as the text messages can. In lots of way's I do see where the teachers are getting at that cell phones are not safe for the school regulation. Because students can and will get hurt if the drama on cell phones is stated then the kids and teen's parents might contact the school and yell and most teachers around don't want that happening. That's why cell phone should not be in classes but during lunch and free space of time yes they should be allowed. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","First, I disagree people might have after school to do.

The Mona Lisa is a hard painting, because every people have a different opinion about it. For example some people say she is sad, angry, but some people say she is happy. This Facial Action Coding System can help us. It says Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. This program can read by muscles so it can help us if we have painting and we need analys that. It has classifield six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. If we raise our eyebrows then we are surprised. This system can mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. It says we can probably tell how our friend is feeling by the look on her/his face, but it is not always true. I think everybody had experience when she/he was smiling but she/he was sad inside. And I think this program can not read this if we are similing but we are sad inside. It says the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. It could be good if the students bored or confused but a computer never being a human. In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth and it was instruction #1. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around eyes. It was instructions #2. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces do not lie. The emotionals very important in our life. If our friend is sad but if we are positive and we are smiling than maybe he/she will smile. This technology is pretty good. It has a lot of examples how it is working and it is good if we need to use this program in class. For example analysing painting. But I don not think it always could be analysing human emotionals.","The creation of these car will truly define what our generation is made of. Self-driving cars is a great idea and process, although it may have many faults, it may reduce the risk of car accidents. Driverless cars are a great advance in technology and with the perfect twists and tweaks, these cars could impact our futures majorly. Driverless cars may reduce the risk of accidents, help the driver multitask in a way, and seem very efficent in achieving the goal of changing our future. Self driving cars is a unique idea and it very well may be our future. Self driving cars could help us reduce the number of accidents. The idea of the car assisting us is a great factor into why these cars could be useful. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" That leaves a little room for the driver to make decisions. That means the driver is still in control. ""The only safe car has a human driver control at all times"" (paragraph 9). The car is not driving itself, it is assisting you in the fact that you are in control of what the car does or doesn't do. With the tweaking of these cars, I feel as if this would be a conveniant idea, and help reduce the causes of car accidents. Texting and driving is one of the greatest factors to the cause of motor vehicle crashes. The ability the smart car has to help the driver multitask could help if not stop the crashes caused by someone texting or paying attention to something else. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves"" (paragraph 7) With the ability to do practically any driving skill with little help by the driver, this could very well give the ability of multitasking to drivers. Knowing that being able to eat or text while driving and having no troubles may help the effect texting and driving has on cars and drivers. The self driving car seems like a consistent idea. With technology on the rise we very well could have the perfect car to fix all our problems. All of the car manufacturers are trying their hardest to do what's best for drivers. ""they needed a whole lot of sensors"" (paragraph 4). With the improvements on things like the sensors, this car could be one of the greatest accomplishments ever. ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"" (paragraph 4). This goes to show that they are taking advantage of the new opportunities they receive each and every day. This use of technology to help the car could help lead to one of the greatest improvements in our era. With driverless cars, our whole lives could be changed. The reduction of accidents and deaths will drop with these advances. A car that can do the impossible can very well be our future. With these cars and their assistance, the sky is the limit. A very creative thought, that is not only interesting, but efficent in what it does.","Cars are one of the most iconic things about American culture. America ""is the birthplace of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally..."" (source 4) From Mustangs to trucks America has it all and we, as a people, think of cars as a necessity in life and we see them all around us everyday. So what if our car usage was limited? It mght not be as bad as you think. Reducing our usage of cars has advantages such as bettering the environment and improving the structure of a city. Reducing our use of the car would have numerous positive effects on the state of the environment around us. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gs emisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (source 1) The pollution has gotten so bad in cities like Paris that they have even gone so far as to ""...enforce[d] a partial driving ban to clear the air..."" (Source 4) The havy car usage that we are accustomed to increases the amount of these harmful gases in the environment. ""...emisions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" (source 1) Reducing our usage, or even completely eliminating it, would improve our environment drastically and help maintain and lower the amount of pollution in the air. There have been pioneering cities who have already started banning cars, even for just a day, like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia. The residents of  Vauban, Germany have done something no one before them has, they have given up their cars. 70 percent of the residents there don't even own a car anymore and have said that they are much happier this way. While some may say that the elimination of cars might be detrimental to car comapnies, there have been companies, like Ford, who have ""partner[ed] with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and oublic transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emisions,a nd improve safety'"" (source 4) In this town of Vauban, Germany public transportation has been made more accessible eliminating the need for a car, and in turn has made places like shopping malls more accessible on main roads. In Bogota, Colombia there has been a car-free day where people find other means of transportation like biking, walking, or buses to get around for the day. ""The goal is to promot ealternative transportation and reduce smog."" (source 3) Other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, have joined Bogota in this event, also having a car-free day. This day has made changes throughout the city improving sidewalks, reducing traffic, openingv new shooping districts, and even constructing 118 miles of bicycle path. The effects of the reduction and elimination of car usage can be seen in these citys' sturctures and the improvements that have been made. The limiting of car usage has been shown to be helpful to the environment and helps to better the structure of a city and like Bogota, Valledupar, and even Paris we should all take into consideration the positive effects that limited car usage would have on us.                                                                                                    ","today after i tell you some facts about the seagoing cowboys you should go check out the recroting site. now number one, the seagoing cowboys get to see some of the most fasnating and beatiful sites across the world. number two when going we don't just work, work ,work we also have lots of fun. all the seagoing cowboys also gets to go and do things no other person here as ever done. when we go on trips sometimes yes it does get a little stressful and tiering,but when we drop the animals of we play games and even have parties. sometimes when we're going home the days just roll on by like water. when we get to are locatoin and unload the animals, most of the time we spend the night and see all of the senery. all the time we go see things but olso do things like go meet new people. we go and find new food to try. sometimes we even almost get blown of the ship. which will give you a big adredilan rush.",,,,,,,
909,109,"I disagree with the mandatory extracurricular policy for three main reasons. First, I believe it is unfair to students who don't wish to be forced into doing an extracurricular activity. Second, I know that students who already participate in any extracurricular outside of school like sports, gymnastics, or dance would be forced to do even more than they already did. It would add to an already busy schedule for those students. I also believe that it is a basic right a student has, to be able to leave school when school is over. Unless you have detention or some sort of consequence for getting in trouble, you should be allowed to leave the school when it is over. It is a very simple fact. Kids do not always want to stay at school longer than they already have to. If they do not wish to participate in any after school activities why could the school still make them do it anyway? It does not make sense from the point of view of a student. Kids have other things they want to do. They would much rather have time to hangout with their friends, be watching TV, playing video games, and doing homework, than being forced stay after school doing something they don't want to. A second group of students who would have a problem with this policy would be students who already participate in extracurricular activities outside of school. They could have sports practices up to four or five times a week. I know personally I practice swimming twice per week and basketball and soccer once. That means during four days of the week I would be doing my homework and going to practice. If I had and after school activity on top of all of that, I would be in big trouble when it comes to school and my grades. I also know some other kids who have worse schedules than I do. I doubt they would want to be forced to add on to the immense workload they already have. My third an final reason I believe this would be a bad policy, is because a student should have the right to be able to leave school. Unless you have some sort of punishment like detention, it should be a students right to be able to leave school once the day is completed. It would be seen as unfair if they were forced to stay and do something they don't want to do. They would make the whole system worse anyway. It would all be less productive because the people who are forced to be there would drag their feet and be lazy. The only people who should participate in after school clubs should be the people who want to be there, and people who want to be productive. In conclusion, I believe that this would be a policy that would have a negative effect on students as well as the clubs that would be taking these students in the first place. I believe that is is unfair to kids who just don't want to stay at school longer and wish to go and do what they would want to do in their free time. I also believe that it is unfair to students who already participate in activities outside of school during the week. It would add a lot more to their already busy schedules. Finally, I also believe that it should be the right of the students to be able to leave if they want to. If they want to go have a social life and have fun, the school should allow them to do that. That is why I believe that students should have a choice about whether or not they want to participate in these programs. ","Have you ever wanted to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program? Well let me tell you why you should. We have lots of fun things fo you do to, and more for you to explore. The Seagoing Cowboys Program is a fun club were you go on long trips across the ocean to deliver things to the army. In this program, we have lots of fun things to do, and lots of things to explore. In my past years of being in this program, I have traveled across many oceans and have been able to see China and more. This Program allows you to travel the seas and see things across the world that you though you would have never seen before. This program has many fun things to do. While you are on the sea, you can play many games including dodgeball, basebal, tennis, boxing, and many more. Me and my friend always played these games in the empty pens that held all the animals that we brought to the army. Going on these trips allows you to have some free time to yourself, and travel around the world. Spending time with your crew mates can teach you things you never knew about them, and become closer friends. The Seagoing Cowboys Program will allow you to travel around the world and explore places that you have always dreamed of seeing. These trips include, Italy, China, Florida, and much more. I have been working here for 9 years and each year I get to see new places. During these trips, you get to care for horses and much more animals. Although traveling on sea can lead to many pros and cons, it's a very fun expirememnt that I think you need to try. Joing this program was one of the best things that I have ever done. It has allowed me to meet new people, and explore places that I thought I would have never seen before. Why don't you try it? I promise it will be the best thing you have ever done. Trust me, I though I was going to have this job until I found a better one, but no. I hope you can trust me, and be sure to think about it. This is why you should joing the Seagoing Cowboys program. We have lots of fun things to do, and much more for you to explore. I hope to see you here next year. ","I feel like I am for the value of this use of technology, because you can calculate other peoples facial emotions and your facial movements. I feel like if you can calculate emotions on a persons face you could understand that person better and what there feeling. You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face. You could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad. Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared. Your emotions could be all over the place. You could have certian facial expressions. For an example, you could have your fear look. You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look. The software could even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. I know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions. I personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect. This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future. This new technologyis the same technology for making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or surgery. "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication "" that Dr. Huang had. Computured need to understand that, too "" said Dr. Huang. Your personal computer can't handle the complex of the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. You sometimes has to ask yourself "" Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" and "" Can your lab partner recognize which one? "" So I think that this technology is a good idea.        ","""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article that is written by someone who has perspectives on what is good about driverless cars, and what is bad about the cars. After reading this article I believe that the driverless cars are going to be very helpful, and useful to people in the future. I believe that driverless cars will be helpful because the driver will not have to do much work, because the car drives itself 90% of the time. Also in this article the author tell us that the Google driverless cars, can drive up to half a million miles before the car crashes. Driverless cars will also be helpful because the people that were originally driving, do not have to memorize directions anymore. Being a driver requires a lot of attention to the road, and it is hard to pay attention to everything else that is going on around them. With the new driverless car, you do not have to drive the car 90% of the time, which allows for more time to think about other things or make sure that your kids are behaving in the back seats, without having to pay attention to the road. Although 10% of the time you may have to drive, the other 90% you are worry free of driving and can focus on other things that you need to. When people are driving themselves, they tend to be in car accidents very often whether it is severe or not. With the driverless car, you can prevent accidents from happening for a much longer time. Driverless cars have gone up to half a million miles before ever being in a single accident. Going half a million miles without an accident, or the car breaking down is unheard of and nearly impossible, but with the driverless cars, the technology is so outstanding, that the car can go this far. Using a GPS while in a car can be distracting and not safe to the driver, and everyone else that is in the car. Since the driverless car drives for people, now the people in the car can set the GPS and not be distracted by the road. With this feature, the car will always know when the right time to turn is, and will always get you to your destination on time. If you are a person who is late a lot or gets lost all the time, then you might be interested in this car, because it does all of the work for you. Driverless cars are a great idea because they drive 90% of the time, which leaves the driver to be focused on other things, it can drive up to half a million miles before crashing or breaking down, which will make the car owner feel very safe and secure in the car that they own, and also the car takes you where you tell it to because of the GPS system, which can make the owner worry free about getting lost. I believe that this car will be very successful, and it will be the future in the car industry.","Should Cell Phones Be Used While Driving a Vehicle? Today, the Majority of humans own and operate Cell Phones on a daily basis. For example, using your phone while operating a vehicle. Drivers should not be able to use Cell Phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I personally think it would free up car accidents as in not so many accidents that deal with using your Cell Phone. Cell Phones use cause over 1 in 4 accidents. Majority involve drivers distracted while talking on handheld or hands free Cell Phones. Majority involve drivers distracted while talking on handheld or hands free cellphones. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 27% of car crashes in 2013 were caused by cell phone use. Cell Phones use and hands free illegal in schools or highway work zones, However, California, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Jersey, and Georgia etc. Prohibit all drivers from using hand held cell phones while driving. Cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. That's why I say no Cell Phones should be used while operating a motor vehicle at any time. It would prevent less car accidents from cell phone use. In 2015, 42% of high school students reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive. Parents should avoid calling their teens when he or she is driving. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call if received while driving. A federal transportation funding law passed in July 2012, known as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. This is the kind of concrete information that can arm the people trying to combat distracted driving and it's a heated battle. The hand held law is necessary and important, but if it is not combined with warnings about the dangers of hand free calls, then it may inadvertently promote an almost equally distracting and dangerous behavior. So if you think tempted to make or take a hands free call, think again. It could kill.   ","Many of us have probably found our selves stuck in a situation when you cant decide on something. That can have us reaching out for advice from someone like a family member, friend, or even a stranger. But the person that you ask for help could have a different view point or idea than what had originally thought, wither good or bad. Getting advice from more than one person can prove to be a good thing to help you out when your having trouble seeing form diffrent angles form a decision making stand, asking for advice from multiple is good and can help you in decision making. When asking more than one person for advice and hearing the different view points from them can prove very beneficial in your choice making. Because listening to other peoples thoughts on things can help affect and mold your own ideas or choices. It can also help you to become more open minded about a new situation can be good for the mind because being able to see other positive outcomes of a different choice that you can make really helps you out in the long run and in a good way can help you choose a better choice. When asking others for advice about making a choice, asking multiple people can help you make a better judgment and understand it more. When trying to decide on something we might not really understand what something means or have only seen a small fragment of its potential. By asking others and listening to what they think or know about it can therefore help you to understand more in depth and look at the bigger picture differently because of it. I can agree that getting advice from more than one person can affect you in a positive way and can help you make better choices Because whenever I need advice trying to decide something like what food to order or what outfit looks better, I always ask my friends for help because I like to hear other peoples thoughts or opinions on something to help make a better decision then I could make on my own. When I was twelve years old my mom had signed me up for a summer camp that I didnt want to attend but talking to other people who had gone before made me change my mind, I was glad I was able to talk to them and changed my mind about it. Asking for advice from multiple people is good for decision making, for example your family members, friends, or even strangers can help mold your choices or thoughts which can lead you to a making a better choice. They can better improve your knowledge or understanding of something that you didnt before, asking and talking about the different outcomes and other ideas with different people can help open more thoughts and opinions for you, and listening to others view points or beliefs can help you with your final choice.","To prove to my fellow collegues about the ""Face on Mars"" thing was naturally made, not by alien lifeforms, i have decided to write this paper. This face has shodows and yes it does make it look like it has eyes, nose, and mouth, but that just really what we want to see if you were told it was a face you would've beleived it. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" has a lot of suspense and it does indeed pull the reader in, and towards the end they break down the scientific facts. They use examples of here on earth and they talk about the showdows. They even talk about how the resolution of photos could change the perspective of those photos. This face shaped mound on mars has just thrown all the theories out and has caused a big worry in the world. Personally I did not see the face until i had read through the article pretty much pin-pointing all of the features, so i went back to the picture of the face and that when i did see it. One persons theory has caused problems for everything from t. v. to conversations. The fact of the matter is that when you look at this mound and you are told its a face you are most likely gonna beleive that concept until you get the scientific facts and you read them and you probably still wont beleive it, because as humans there has always got to be something that drives you to be excited. Its in our genetics and our concept is just going to be stuck with until there is an actual reasoning that can be proven. In this paper i have mostly talked about my beleifs, but everyone has their own beleifs and I know that we can not fully prove there is life on other planets, but whatever makes you strive fo answers be my guest. I am not here to judge you or shoot down your answers. I am here to give you once again another concept.",,,,,,,
613,109,"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" the author describes how this new techology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotion. This technology is valuable in a classroom to read emotional expressions because, It wolud make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting, it could help us know how people are felling in that exact time and, it could give us more of an explanation on older pictures so we can understand the picture a little bit better. First of all, the Facial Action coding system would be valuable in a classroom today because, it would make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting. What this means is that insead of a teacher just giving out a lesson that half the class wont even like, the Facial Action Coding system would elinonate that because it get our emotions and give each indiviual person a lesson that fits them the best.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Seconltly, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classrom today because, it could help peolpe know how people are felling in the exact time or the picture kind of like we were there in the moment. Ok, if someone took a picture and put it on facebook or something you wouldnt know how there felling you would just know what they wanted you to feel. Just because someone is smiling that doesnt mean they are happy, it just means they are smiling, but with the Facial Action Coding System we would know how the person is actualy felling Thirldy, the Facial Action Coding System wpuld be valuable in a classrom today because, it could give us more of an explanation on older pictures so we can understand the picture a little bit better. So just like the ""Mona Lisa"" the Facial Action Coding System helped us understand how she was felling a the time of the picture. To sum this all up, The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom to read emotional expressions because, It wolud make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting, it could help us know how people are felling in that exact time and, it could give us more of an explanation on older pictures so we can understand the picture a little bit better.","when asking multiple people for advice I think of cooking, you ask people to try it if you think it needs something or if it needs to be cooked longer. Asking multiple people for advice is good because you have options an outsider opinion or perspective. some examples of this are. Asking multiple people for advice is good because you can get perspective, an example of this is shown in the office TV show , ""Michael"" (Steve Carell) is always asking everyone for advice. then he asks is friend and finally gets some good advice and looks at the perspective and then realizes what to do. Asking multiple people for advice is good because you can get a outsider opinion , an example of this is shown in parks and rec TV show , ""Leslie Knope"" (Amy Polar) wants to build a park but doesnt want to wait. so she ask her friends first and they say just to wait. so she goes to ask and outsider ""Mark Brandaiwits"" in city planing what to do and she take his advice. for witch is just cut the tape and build a park. so it goes to show that an outsider can be good. Asking multiple people for advice is good because you have options, an example of this is can be shown in school while writing an essay. you ask your friends if you should add more or take less off , you ask the teacher if the editing is good or if you should add commas or periods. then you can decide from those options because you asked multiple people for advice. and you most likely end up with two to three good options to pick from. so in the end asking more than one person for advice is good because you learn all these different stragaties to solve problems. and it can even help you develop an open mindset to options and just in general. so next time your stuck or need advice ask at least three people a friend, a teacher an a outsider becasue those three will give you some pretty good advice.","The summer is a time for enjoyment. Summer is where people are free to relax. But, in some cases there is work that needs to be done during the break. Teachers have been assigning summer assignments for the more advanced classes like honors courses. With this, they believe the students will still be learning over the summer and get their work done but, that's not the case. Summer assignments shouldn't be teacher-designed, they should be student-designed because, it can be made to where the students are more comfortable, it can be made to where it's not so much work, and it can be made to be something the students will actually complete. When learning different things in school, students want to be comfortable,especially if it's a new subject they're just getting into. If the students are not comfortable with what they're learning,how will they learn? Some teachers don't take in to consideration that maybe the work was more difficult for the students then it should've been. With students designing their own summer assignments, it can be made to accommodate how they want to learn. Students want to be able to show that they can learn what they're given in a way they're more comfortable with. Teachers often times give students a multitude of work. Students don't want to have to write a two page paper, or do some extremely hard 50 or more question math sheet. There shouldn't be that much work to continue learning over the summer. Too much work can put a lot of stress on a student. Some students have jobs, sports, and other curricular activities that they already have to do for part of their summer. Student-designed summer assignments can help the students get their work done in a timely manner and let them be able to enjoy the rest of their summer while getting what they need done finished. During the summer, students don't want to have to do school work, it's summer. But since the summer assignments are needed, the students might as well get it out the way. With teacher-designed summer assignments, all of the work can be boring and too much for students during the summer. Students don't want to have to do boring work through an exciting and fun summer. With student-designed summer assignments, the work can be made exciting,or at least to where it's not as boring. The students can do learning scavenger hunts, write a paragraph on how their summer went, or even just do review games until school starts back up. These options may not be very effective to teachers, but the students will still be learning and will actually be interested and get their work done. Summer assignments are a miserable thing for students to do during their summer but with the student-designed summer assignment, it can all become better. The student-designed summer assignment can help with comfort ability, stress, and actually getting the work done. I believe that this should be a change to help the turnout of learning during the summer. With this change, learning will be more effective and work will be completed.","As a young American citezen here an Florida alot of people use cars to move around from their house to there jobs or to travel to other states to visit people. but in other states like new york people dont use cars like and many other countries like france,Colombia and many other South American countries. To begin with here an American there was been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39 years old getting a lincens while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age mr. sivaks research has found. study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per personj was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was  in January 1995. part of the explanation certaintly lies in the recession,because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. Michael sivak said ''what most intrigues me si that rates of car ownership per househoild and per person staretd to come down two to three years before the downturn. many socialogists believe it will have a beneficial implicantions for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. but in France diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy thatt favors diesel over gasoline. dieselsmakes up 67 percent of vihicles in france compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe. while in america millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays reamins an open question.                    ","Giving details and information, I think the author explained well the dangers of Venus. He explained the temperatures and how hot it can get there, how it can melt metal things and that it's just not worth living there. But it is worth exploring as in studying it, the rocks and maybe they can find something that could possibly live there. The author supports the idea of studying by saying in paragraph 8 how ""Venus has value"" and how ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limilted by dangers and doubts but she be expanded to meet the very edges or imagination and innovation. The author says that it gets over 800 F in Venus, says that it could've been possibly like Earth years ago, where humans can live in. But NASA has to do more studying on rocks and other sediments and onjects on Venus. The author explaines how much carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and I believe carbon dioxide is so good for a planet. The planet isn't very useful to live in since it crushes metalic things, and for example cars, something we need to get around places.","Dear Principal, Community service, good or bad. I know your trying to decide if community service should be a requirement or not. During this letter I hope to tell you some reasons why it should be a requirement and some reasons why not. I hope this letter answers your problem. There are many benefits to community service, for one your helping someone in the community ever time you pick up a pop can or take 15 minutes to help a neighbor or fellow classmate with home work he might not understand. Community service is a way to make a difference, but its something you want to do not have to. If you do community service because you want to then you get to feel the reward and how good it feels to help someone besides yourself. If you have to do it you don't get to feel any of that also if you don't want to do it then you probably won't do you best or even enjoy it. At the same time there are times we need to help the community, if the community is in a time of need and can't hire people to clean up the streets you should step in an help. A community is should be a place to feel safe and a place to enjoy being in, but you can't do either of those things if you step on a can ever step you take. You should take pride in your community and keep it clean especially if it is the only one you got. What kind of people do community service? People who want to or people who have to. Also when they do it who does a better job? Have you ever been going down the high way and seen men and women in orange jump suites cleaning up the high way. They get the job done but not very well. Also have you drove down the high way and seen young boys and girls in green suites cleaning up the highway for fun. These pride students love to help the community and they do a good job at it that's why you shouldn't have do community service you, you should do it because you want to. This was my letter telling why community service is a good thing just not a thing we should have to do. Were students not criminals. You should take pride in your work and help the community but not have to. Sincerely, A local student      ","I believe driving should be in the hands of humans along with the assistance of a machine. Having autonomous care can enbale us to do different things while driving. With the extra control over the car, we can make the roads safer while we multi-task on the road. Semi- autonomous cars can help us get to a hospital if we are sick or injured and are unable to drive. If a parent needs to take care of a child in the backseat, she can reach back and take care of the child without having to worry about the road as well. These systems can also teach people how to drive behind the wheel; and if there is a problem, the car can take control and keep others safe as well as the driver. Kids that are working to get their liscense could have more experience driving alone since the system in the car is there to help in case of a problem. But that wont completely destroy the purpose of needing a liscense to drive becasue people will still need to know how to drive since the car is not always in full control. In conclusion, fully automated cars may not be the best thing due to their inability to judge and react to situations. Semi- autonomous vehicles can assist us in the vehicle, but can still be controlled with our quick reactions in case of a problem. Instead of giving all control to the machine, the driver and the car should work together to preserve the safety of themselves and others around them.        ",,,,,,,
250,104,"Dear Principle, I believe that students must participate in sports or any other activities no matter what grade they get. Sports helps the students' brains to become active. Without those activities, then your students would fail their classes. Not only does those activities help your students from failing their classes, but also letting them have fun and getting them active. Those sports and activities would also help the school to become fit and may give students a good future. When I say good future I mean that if a student likes to play this certain kind of sport, they would work hard into it and may lead them to getting a scholarship for their collage. To get a scholarship students would have to have an excellent grade on their studies and do good in sports as well. If you disable those activities from your students, then they may fail their classes and might not have the chance on giving them a good future. Sincerely , Student","Texting and Driving Texting while driving is extremely dangerous, in 2017 alone, nearly 3000 lives were claimed due to it. The NHTSA is leading a national effort to protect lives and to stop the behavior from occurring. The popularity of cellphones and other electronics has had some unintended and sometimes deadly consequences. An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while texting, including use of cell phones while driving, resulting in injury and occasionally death. Know the facts, be involved, and keep the roads safe. Texting while driving is the act of using a cellphone while behind the wheel of a vehicle. This includes talking or texting on your phone, playing mobile games, using apps, pulling up a map; anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving. Using a cell phone while driving drastically increases the chances for serious accidents on the road. However, everyone can help in the cause to prevent injuries by ending texting and driving. The first thing that can be done is to give clear instructions to new drivers. Give easy and simple instructions so they can understand. Before drivers get their licenses, tell them that diverting their eyes from the road for a few seconds could cause serious injury to someone. Leading by example is another action we can take to make the roads safer. No one should text and drive, so show others that by not doing it. If you're an example for others, they'll likely follow. Set some rules for yourself to follow and enforce them on your family. Texting while driving is not a very responsible or smart thing to do. It can be very serious and lead to harm. Thousands of people every year are seriously injured due to texting behind the wheel. However, we can prevent it from happening, if we set rules for family, lead by example, and teach others we can help stop texting while driving. If you take a stand and make an example, we can make a difference. Works Cited ""The Dangers of Distracted Driving.""

","I think the students should be able to choose whether they want to do community service or not because not everybody is in shape to do alot of things around the community because they could have had surgery or their bones might be to weak to be walking around all the time, and if they have things wrong with them like that then you should not make them have to do that and be up all the time walking around and doing everything for you that you don't want to do and they should not have to do that as specially if you don't want to do it and say that your not going to do it then why even say that they have to or even try to make it a law that everybody has to do it except for adults and we have enough to worry about like our school work getting chores done at home and taking care of ourselves and our pets, so that don't give us any time to do community service unless we want to and if we have free time to do and if that was to ever happen then it should at least be only twice a week and we should be able to pick the days then we should be able to get a sheet of paper so that way we can write down what we picked up from around the community and then each piece of trash we pick up should be some kind of bonus and the same if we were to help people out like say they needed help loading up the groceries in the car and they couldn't do it all by themselves and that is my opinion. I am pretty sure that alot of other teenagers would think the same exact thing and if the principle tried to make it any longer i think that everybody would go on strike.","When electing the president of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolar College to decide. The Electroral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disaprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disintrest of voters, and reduces a candidates intrest in a state. One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have acurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the piopular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote. One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait. As stated before, the larger the population of a states, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election preiod (the period in which candidates move to diferent states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president. The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president.    ","Citizens of the united states should participate in the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. First off they are sending animals such as horses, young cows, and mules to the coutries that were debistated from world war 2. Also they get the benfit of seeing Europe and China. Last they are serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. And this people is why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. To support the reason that they get the benifit of seeing Europe and China. They see most of Europe. They see most of China too. And they see what most ordinary people don't get to. This shows why people should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. And to support the reason that your serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. They are part of the UNRRA . The UNRRA stands for (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). And so they are helping the debistated countries of Europe and China from world war 2. Last to support the reason that they are helping others in need of animals from the debistation of world war 2. They are giving people animals. They are also giving people their needs. And from those animals they are getting people the products they need. And I see why people do not want to join the program. maybe they want to stay with their families, or they get sea sick, or the fact that they just don't like animals. In conclusion this is why people need to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. Like I said, they are sending animals to the countries that were debistated from world war 2. They also get the benifet of seeing Europe and China. They are also serving for the orginazation of the UNRRA. Now I recomend you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program.       ","If your child was to get a chance at getting home schooled, and you no longer have to be at school to get your education. How would it benefit the student ? First, Some children does not like being around others. For example, some students may have drama going on with one another and you cant really focus on your school work and drama, so you being at home working would benefit the students a lot in this case. Also, students that may be depressed or Anti-social may need their own space to work on their school work, so the program would help out in their favor. Being in your own area sometimes is very peaceful, but doing your school work there is even better! Because you getting your education and you are at home getting it. However, students may not ever get tired of the program. Why? Because students/children have their own pace to things so being in this program you can start your lesson whenever you want and finish whenever you want. Majority of the students may would like to be at home in their own space because it may be more comfortable for them. Having your feet kicked up with a nice healthy sandwich beside you while doing your school work doesnt sound amazing to you? ITS WONDERFUL! Adults, Teens, and Older people know teens love their sleep. Yes you've guessed it more sleep! School hours is way different if you are participating in the building verses online. School starts early in the morning and you have to get out your bed, get dressed and also travel to your school. But the home program is different you could wake up and go straight to work without the extra moving and getting dress. More focus and better understanding may be one of the reasons why students would want to get into this program. Everyone knows a school house isnt that quiet , some students are detraction to others. I know me myself doesnt like a lot of loud noise especially when I trying to get my work done and correct. Students sometimes works better by themselves. Reading and Writing are ligature subjects , and sometimes you have to read but some students doesnt like reading out loud or at all because of their self esteem. Some students may feel as though they cant read and they think someone is going to laugh at them ! So the home program may boost plenty of students self-esteem. Being by yourself sometimes get the work done faster and better. How? because you dont have to keep giving someone else feed back. You just can get the work done and turn it in. You are also by yourself so theres really no one that could hold you back from doing your work and no one there to distract you but you. So, these are some of the reasons on why the home schooled program may benefit students! I know some of these reasons because i was a home schooled student, and these were some of the cons i loved about the program. The home school program may seem like a lot to do but its just like you being at school but you are at home with a little bit more pep!     ","Hey Earth has a twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author strongly suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Although the author's idea may sound wild to some he does support his argument very intelligently. To begin the author supports his ideas by giving back ground knowledge on Venus. The author then preoceeds to scientificly explain the orbits that Venus, Mars and Earth under takes.""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the cornerin space termshumans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world."" The explanation that the author gives us shows us the simalirty of the planets and the efforts of exploring Venus is important despite its conditons. In paragraph 4 the author uses a rhetorcle device ""If our sister planet is so inhostible, why are scientist even discuusign further vistits to its surface. The author uses a rhetoricle quetsion to get his point across to the reader. The author goes further into depth by describing the geogrphics of Venus and how it could of been a Earth like planet long ago."" Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" The author brings in NASA into the conversation and explains to us how they have been working to explore Venus. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" Although the author is fully aware of the extreme condtions of Venus they still don't believe that hoviering 30 miles from Venus wont provide them with enough information. The author also argues that scientist wont have the ability to take samples of rocks,gas,etc. The author even goes further by saying"" Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to undestand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"". Well Earth may have a twin, but they are not identical. Despite the harsh conditions of Venus the aurthor does a great job with supporting their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. Not to forget the author supported their claim with lots of evidence provied through out the text.",,,,,,,
250,220,"Dear Principle, Kids at SCHOOL_NAME should be able to participate in sports, even if they have a grade C average. Grades shouldn't have to interfere with sports, their are two different subjects. they are both very important to kids. There are three reason why kids should still participate in sports even with a C average. The first reason is, some kids that want to grow up and be a pro soccer player or a pro football player don't need school for it. Kids want to dedicate their time to sports to get better at it, and not on homework or studying. For some kids spots is all they think about because its their dream to become a pro soccer player or pro football player. The second reason is, sports sometimes aren't the only reason why kids have a C average. So why would sports need to be taken away for the grades if playing sports isn't the problem. Kids might have a C average because they don't try in school or they need help on what their learning. Principles and parents should encourage kids to do their work, study for tests, and help them. They will still have time for sports and to improve their grades. The third reason is,      ","TEXTING AND DRIVING ESSAY Today, a lot of car accidents are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving caused a lot of deaths and injuries Over the last few years. People confused themselves when it comes to texting and driving and they don't realize it's a mistake until it's too late. In my opinion I think its best if people turn their phones of completely before they leave their location. Texting and driving is against the law so young drivers and older adults should take it serious. It doesn't matter who's texting you that notification can wait. Taking your eyes off the road while driving should never be acceptable. Me personally, I don't think it's the smartest decision to pick up my phone while driving for any reason. Another reason why it's not safe to text and drive is because it's against the law. Breaking the law against texting and driving results in you having to pay money out your pockets. So just try your best to avoid the situation. Statistics are rising fast for car accidents caused by texting and driving. We all know the love ones at home wouldn't want us to be a part of that statistic. We can change our ways and lower the statistic by simply obeying the law and being patient enough to wait to check our phones. If you don't care enough to avoid a simple mistake, then so be it. My purpose for writing this essay is so people understand how risky texting and driving is so let's make it easy for one another and not be a part of that group of people who partake in texting and driving.                                                                                                      ","Dear Principal, On your subject of deciding to make all the students do community service as a requirement I would like to give you my thoughts on what I would do if I were in your position. To me I don't think that it should be a requirement. For reasons soon to be explained! Although I do think that you should encourage community service often! The reason I believe that you should not make it required is because of some student unwillingness. Usually I have found that when people are doing community service people find it rude when the person helping out is grouchy or doesn't think that they should have to be helping with it. This can sometimes make people unhappy with the service of the help and may not want it again which may cause people who actually want to do it be unable to help later on when they volunteer to. This means that if you force the students who do not want to be helping out of the community on there free time it may cause them to do the things people wouldn't like. I personally know that I can end up being rude to people when I am forced to do something I wouldn't like. Now this leads me to my next point. I believe that you should be encouraging the students to be helping out the community often. This will get students who will be willing to help out in a good manner to do it. That will cause the community to be happy with us children and it will benefit all of us. I personally do not end up helping out all that much in our community, because often I do not find the jobs fun. There is one job I have always enjoyed though it is called Feed My Starving Children. Going to this place with my friends from my church was really a great time. I think that if we went to a field trip to a place like this that is a fun way to help out the community it may get kids excited to help out around town! Here are some of the things you do at feed my starving children if you are considering this. The main goal is to pack up food to send to starving people around the world example Haiti. You have people take positions packing different foods required in a good diet in a certain order in a bag. You also have someone (has to be an adult) seal the bags shut with a little machine they have. Then they are packed into boxes that will be shipped to the different places. I warn you that this is a Christian organization but they will not make anyone who does not the follow the religion pray at the end with them or anything of that sort! I do think this would be a great idea. I would like to thank you for reading this and taking your time on it. It means a great lot that you may consider my idea's. This is your choice though and I will take no disrespect if you do not agree with me. Thank you again please choose well (I am sure you will)! Your Student, STUDENT_NAME","""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Three reasons right there on why we should switch over to election by popular vote. Unfair, outdated, and irrational. Let's help you better understand; ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all-system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" stated in What's wrong with the electoral college (source 2). The electoral college is also unfair because there's always one person, in this case candidates, trying harder than the other person. Also stated in source 2 ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Which is completely unfair, foolish even. Way past outdated, ""In 1968,"" decades ago. There is no reason as to why we still actually have this around, many people stopped voting, maybe not because of how old this act is, but definetly because we need a new way. Election by popular vote could be one of those new ways. This electoral college has to have an experation date on it someday. Irrational. Irrational because it doesn't make sense, if you think about it, it's basically an easy way to get out of cheating, and no one likes cheaters. If we were to change the election by popular vote, think about how much more worth it would be, think about how there wouldn't be as many problems if people voted for the right candidate. What if they actually won? What about all the world changes? It just makes more sense, it's more reasonable. There could be so many things different today if we changed the way election worked years ago. It's never too late, we still have time. Time to stop the unfair, outdated, and irrational ways. All's you need is a little motivation.    ","Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll. He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Along his trip he got chance to visit many places. He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was. He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy. He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean. Helping on his aunt Katie's farm when he was young had prepared luke for hard work. In the story it tells you of a man named Luke Bomberger and what he did as a Seagoing Cowboy. It doesn't really try to convince you to participate in the program but if you do you can get some details from what he did to what you might do if you joined. After this program he said ""it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Scientists have been planning and have been making progress and adventions on exploring Venus like, making an aircraft that would sustain living conditions while being able to explore Venus wthout being harmed. Scientists have concluded that Venus's geography was once like earths and could contain a livable lifestyle like no other. Venus is the most hottest planets, while being second in line from the Sun. The atmosphere is 90x greater than Earths, along with the 97% carbon dioxide and reaching over 800 degrees fehrenheit. Venus's Earth like feature consisting of moutains, valleys, and craters can furthermore be our new nearst option for planetary visits. But would the crucial value of going to venus be approcable. Living on Venus would be around Earths living conditions, with the same amount of pressure and around the same amount of radiation. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans. While scientists are still working on machines to last the challenge of Venus, the innovations would allow them to last more than three weeks in such conditions. Another project scientists are looking in is old technology like mechanical computers like todays. The devices were envisioned in the late 1800s and was a important role in World War II. The devices would make calculations without electrionic need. In comparison the device would need to rendure extreme physical conditions like, being able to stand up to acid, heat and other forces. In conclusion the exploration throughout our planets should not be stopped or limited from the danger and risk of finding out beyond your imagination about our neighbors.            ",,,,,,,
250,728,"Dear Principal, All or most of the students like to be involved in a lot of things and do something that they enjoy doing or like to do. I think that the students with average of a grade C should be able to participate in sport and other activities. Students with grade C should be able to participate in sport and activities, because C is not bad of a grade! It is still considered as a passing grade in all the grades. If most of the students have a grade C as an average and they wouldn't be able to participate in sports or activities, then there will be almost no students involved in anything! I think that activities are not the distraction for students not to study very well to get a B, it is most likely they don't want to or just spend time doing something else out of school. If the students wouldn't be able to participate in school sports or activities they are more likely to go and do things out of school, and be involved in something else as well. All the kids like different activities and I think that they should have an opportunity not just study everyday, but also have some fun and do different things to prepare them for their future. When a student would only be allowed to study and not to participate in anything else they wouldn't have any time to have a break or to relax from a long day that they had in school. Students participating in sports and activities helps them take down the stress that they might of had in school, with friends or in a family, by doing sports or being involved in other activities and being able to communicate with others. That takes their mind of something that had bothered them. Therefore, I think that students with an average of a grade C should be able to participate in sports and activities. To have fun with friends and doing things they like. Also, taking the stress down and having something else to do out of school.","Phones and Driving Have you ever wondered about the dangers of operating a phone while driving? Should people be able to use a phone while driving a car? Will there be a future of using phone while driving? There is a great percentage of drivers that use their phones while driving a car. With many opportunities to use a phone while stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic, phones have been a danger to many people. Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes. Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore). Edgar Snyder & Associates states that ""There are about 1.6 million car crashes a year just because the driver is using their phone."" Those car crashes that occurred are all because of drivers attempting to use their phones. Our smartphones are a great resource to have and use but are a major risk to our lives if used at a wrong time and place. Phones should be used before starting the car and used after getting to the desired destination. Drivers should not be able to use a phone while operating a car because they are a distraction and causes many car crashes. In my personal opinion I don't think people should be able to use a cellphone while operating a car. There are many people lives at stake because of reckless drivers. ""According to the report, cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes (Bey & Associates)"". Using the phone makes the driver's main focus go from driving to what is on the screen. The reckless drivers cause car accidents and that can cause major injuries. Some of those injuries can cause permanent damage while others are small injuries. I am pretty positive that there would be a future of using phones and driving. Even though there are many laws that say using a phone while operating a car isn't allowed people still do it on a daily. There are many states that have already banned the usage of phones while driving. ""18 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. All are primary enforcement laws-an officer may cite a driver for using a hand-held cell phone without any other traffic offense taking place (GHSA)."" There are always those who use their phone while driving, but they should be punished for their recklessness. There would always be a danger to driving and using a phone. The drivers that look at their phones now are already a danger. With the next generation starting to drive there would be an even bigger percentage of accidents. Those who choose to use the phone while driving should suffer the consequences. ""GHSA."" Home, www. ghsa. org/state-laws/issues/Distracted-Driving.

It's important for teenagers to understand how to help others, and not just think of ourselves. Teens are selfish and they need to see how those who are less fortunate have it. For example, the Thirty Hour Famine. We could give up food for thirty hours, as a fundraiser, and give the money to a homeless shelter. Homeless people don't have the money for food. We take eating and shelter for granted. Why do we do this when there are people out there who are starving and thirsting to death? The Thirty Hour Famine would be a great way to help out. Also, we could do something simple, such as helping with the Miracle League, for a school project. The Miracle League is a baseball team for special needs children and adults. They need buddies to help push wheel chairs and to just support them and help them to enjoy the game. These children and adults often feel as if they can't do what the normal person can do. My brother is one of these children. Seeing how much they love it on the field, I think it would be a great way to get teens to better understand humans with special needs. They need to understand because I often hear them insulting people with the word ""retarded"", and that really bugs me. They need to see that being different isn't a bad thing. They need to see the truth. Community service could even be something more simple than that! Have you ever seen the kids sitting alone at lunch? Or even the poor children crying every day? I fear that bullying is increasing, and children are left feeling more alone than ever. Wouldn't you advise us to reach out and become friends with the ones that feel hated and depressed? Suicide rates have gone up and it seems like more children are cutting themselves and relying on self inflicted pain to be a part of something. I've had kids from SCHOOL_NAME tell me they were planning on committing suicide, and just by being a friend, I've stopped them from doing it. I know what it's like to feel alone. But most of the students at SCHOOL_NAME are too worried about their ego that they shrug this horrible fact off. We need to get out there and help! Don't you believe that teens need to quit worrying about their video game scores and their television sets in order to see what life is? I believe that not doing community service makes teens become the selfish, lazy people they are today. Let's reach a hand out, and be good to those in our community. Who knows, you may even save a life. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Dear Senator, The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers extablished as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid run-off elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote. The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popoular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt Romney. Trans-regional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute. Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small sate in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by mal-apportionment of the Senate. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the the most thoughtful voters. To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes run-off elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME                             ","I never regretted joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. It was a lifetime oppurtunity, so I accepted. When I was asked, I couldn't say no. It changed my life, and I fully encourage anyone of interest to join. First of all, we travel all around the world and try so many new things. There is so much more to this world than you think. The Seagoing Cowboys and I got to see all over Europe and China. We even got to spot the Panama Canal on our way to China! We also were able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see the Acropolis in Greece, and tour a castle in Crete! I wouldn't trade anything for those adventures. Anyone can have this experience, after all, I was just a small town boy. Another reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy is that we have so much fun. During our long voyages, we play lots of games. After unloading the animals, we played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds. To pass the time, we would have table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, whittling, and even reading. We just did so many fun things together, the trips didn't seem to long. Before we knew it, we would arrive at the docks, ready for another journey out to seas. These journeys were more than adventures, but brand new worlds. If you don't understand what I mean, then you need to. But if you do, You should know exactly what I am trying to tell you. You will experience feelings you have never had before. I love to travel and do new things. This is just my passion, what I was meant for. In conclusion, I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy has been a great experience for me, and could be for you too. Mabye this message was for you and inspired you to be a Seagoing Cowboy, mabye it wasn't. It is okay if this didn't convince you to be a Seagoing Cowboy, because I know this job was meant for me, and many of you out there in this world.","In recent times, many schools have started to offer distance learning for students. Parents have voiced their opinions on the benefits and the detriments of online school. However, Students would benefit from taking online courses or video conference classes because students that may be considered unpopular may not fit into the learning environment, students may have no means of transportation to the school, and students with certain mental disabilities, physical disabilities, or medical conditions may not be able to function independently in a public school setting. Distance learning for some students would be beneficial to their grades, mental health, and other inconveniences that come along with attending a public school. For example, my friend's brother Generic_Name was bullied all throughout elementary school and middle school and was considered an outcast by his peers. Due to this, he was always on edge while in school, causing him to fall behind in his classes. When he learned of the opportunity to complete his high school education from home, he applied immediately. Because he switched to online school, Generic_Name received better grades and was overall the happiest he had even been. Another example is my cousin Generic_Name. While in school, Generic_Name was constantly stressed by the pressure she felt to succeed placed on her by her parents, teachers, and fellow classmates. As a result, she could not focus on her studies and received disappointing grades on her report cards. Her parents learned of her situation and decided to let Generic_Name try online courses. Unknowingly, this was a great decision and my cousin felt more relaxed and got straight A's on the following report card. For some students, getting to school on time every morning is a challenge. My best friend Generic_Name lived miles away from the nearest school and his parents had no way to take him to school and the buses did not come out as far as his residence. Therefore, he had no way to school, but if he was able to take online courses he would not have to worry about getting to school everyday. Another friend of mine, Generic_Name, lived on a secluded farm with his parents and lived too far for the buses, as well. In addition, he had to wake up very early in the morning to aid his parents with the livestock. In both cases, online courses would have been the best option and could become standard for those living far away from schools. A video conference or online course experience would most likely be the best option for students with disabilities. As an example, a child with cancer would most likely have to be taken out of school in order to recover. However, they are missing vital information while out of school. Furthermore, children in the hospital most likely want to have the comfort of a relatively normal life. Online education would be a beneficiary to the child so it can still gain its education in recovery. Another example could be a child with cerebral palsy. Due to the child's condition, it may be hard for him of her to move around easily, so a large public school would definitely not be the greatest option for that student. In conclusion, distance learning may not be the greatest option for the majority of students, but it would be a great option for certain students. Online school is a solution to any problem that might arise from having to attend public school, and could mean the success of a struggling students' endeavors.","Venus is an unknown planet, despite being so close to us. It is hostile, and no human could survive on its surface. But some think it is possible to reach the surface and study Venus up close. It has many dangers in the way of progress. It's clouds contain sulfuric acid, and it's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The pressure on the surface in 90 times greater than that of Earth, and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It boasts the hottest surface tempuature of any planet in the solar system, and has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent bursts of lightning that impeade probes and rovers exploring the surface. But some think it is still a possiblity to go to the hostile planet. The author of the article believes it is possible to reach and explore the surface despite the danger. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents by explaining that it may have once been earth-like a very long time ago, that it is the closest planet to Earth for exploration, and how scientists are now testing ways to get on the surface without any casualties. The author gives support by explaining the fact the surface of Venus was once earth-like, and that it had many of the features that Earth has on it's current surface. It is amazing to think that such a unsuitable planet could have once been eath-like, but being near as it is to Earth, it is not entirely impossible. The author tells how many have made comparisons to Earth based on it's current surface, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because of it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system....Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The feature the author talks about are very Earth-like, so the possiblity of it once being like a ""utopain"" planet are not dim. He point out the valleys, mountains, and craters that can be seen around the surface. Maybe the craters were the cause of the hostility on the planet, and it's inhabitent were wiped off the planet by a imbargement of asteriods and possibly comets. And the crashs caused climate change, thus shifting the planet into it's demise for supporting life. But if it is so close, couldn't this be true, that Venus was once in the Goldilocks Zone, and while Earth formed, Venus was the planet of life. After all, it is our neighbor. The author continues to support his ideas of exploration by pointing out the fact that Venus is, at most times, the closest planet to us, Mars being a bit more distant. It is often called our sister planet, as we have very much in common with Venus. The author explains how closly were related to Venus, and why we chose to explore it, ""Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desity and size.....Futhermore, recall the Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" It is about the same size, and relativly close, so it is one of the obvious choices. It is also noted that in space, time matters. If you don't get to the planet quick, your ship could lose oxygen, your could run out of food, or you might miss the planet when it goes through rotation, making harder to get home and less likely to reach the planet another time. Although it is hard to make the surface of Venus, it is our closest option and is more like us, thus making it more suitable. The question for scientists is how. This question may not be solved for a long time, but already, scientists are making advaces toward the next landing on Venus. The author also supports his idea of Venus exploration by showing ways that people are making advaces toward a possible landing. New technologies and old technologies alike are being combined to make the landing last, and for futher exploration. The author shares some of the developments made by scientist recently, ""Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitide to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condition by staying up and out of thier way."" Another advance includes using new material the protect electronics and other computer equipment in the hostile environment, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of the Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" NASA has made significant advance in the pursuit of getting onto the most Earth-like hostile planet in the solar system. New discoveries continue to be made, and soon the expedition for Venus will be underway. The author has supported his claim throughout the article that studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining it's likeness to Earth, it's closeness in proximity, and how scientists are advancing closer toward the goal of landing. Humans have done things like this before. The 1969 moon landings, for example, were thought to be impossible, but through human drive and motivation, we achieved this goal, and now we are faced with a new challenge, Venus. But with the same human drive and motivation that put man on the moon, people will explore our ""twin"" planet, and uncover it's greatest secrets. ",,,,,,,

But we lost In voleyball but in basketball we won. I was So happy because you get so exited and then nervous because then you think that your going to lose but you never know ig you don't try.

And that what I think principal so please don't change the rules. And if i want to do and acticity well if I have a C than, she atleast can check my conduct in class. Or maybe some student don't have a B avarage they could got and C and they could be one of the best.

Cell phones have also advanced over the years with companies coming out with new smartphones and new technology. With the new smartphones there has been more distractions to people such as driving while texting. That's why people shouldnt operate a phone while driving. Texting while operating an automobile has shown to be dangerous and hazardous to the person driving and the people around them. This is causing a significant amount of accidents and deaths. According to the text ""Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S. roads.""(NHTSA ). This statement it proving that being distracted by a smartphone can be dangerous and cause large amounts of accidents and deaths. When operating a vehicle people are allowed to use devices as long as they are hands free meaning that the device you are using must be voice activated so that both hands can be on the wheel at all times , but it is still proven to be a distraction to drivers. According to a psychology lecturer at the University of Sussex in England Graham Hole ""Talking on your phone while driving even if you use hands free connection is still dangerous.""because any conversation on the phone can be a distraction to the person surroundings. This new generation of people and all the new smartphones and gadgets are causing people to be more dependent on cell phones than anything else. Everyday people walk around with their heads in there phones not paying attention to where their going. Now that people use vehicles for everyday use its is easy for them to get side track and use their phones while driving. With the new features on the updated smartphones you can do video calls and voice automated things on your phone. With these new features on smartphones people are more prone to using their phones while driving causing a higher risk of death and accidents. Everyday someone is involved in a car accident because they were on there phone, texting while driving is the leading cause of death. There was a 7 year old boy named Xzavier Davis - Bilbo who was crossing the street and he was hit by a car and not only was he hit but the car dragged him 20 feet . The driver was texting on the phone when she hit 7 year old Xzavier . He spent months in the ICU and he is now paralyzed because of this. When people text and drive they put everybody around them in danger not just the people in the car with them. In conclusion phones are a very distracting factor when driving and dangerous. Anything such as a hands-free device still shouldn't be allowed because it is still a distraction. These problems are injuring and killing people. People should not text and drive.                                                              ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, There has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home. My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink. My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work. My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program. In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, student of SCHOOL_NAME.","Dear Mr. Senator, electoral college is a process that consists of selecting electors,meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. electoral college should not be changed to election. electoral college should be kept because it will help save the tress by saving paper, one wouldnt have to go anywhere because the electoral college is not a place,and because there are 5 different methods of choosing the president. saving paper is extremely important. paper comes from trees and many animals and wild life have homes in trees. with electoral college one wouldnt need paper to vote, which is a paper saver. the electoral college helps a lot when it comes to selecting electors,metting of the electors and where they wil vote for the president, and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. by saving gas one is saving money which can be used for any nessessitites. gas now a days is extremely expensive,but with the electoral college one would be saving money because the electoral college is a process, not a place, and it doesnt require one to travel anywhere,whch saves gas and money. with the oney saved one can buy the nessessities that are needed. the electoral college offers a lot by just being a process. it helps save paper and money,whch is good for wild life and humans. when it comes to methods for choosing the presisent and reasons to keep the method there isnt just 1, theres 5! the first method is that certainty of outcome.. it states that a dispute over the outcome of an elecotral college vote is possible and it happened in 2000,but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. a winning candidats share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example, in the elections that happened in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, b ecause almsot all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis,ev en a very slight. method number 2 is everyone's president. the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no region(south,northeast,etc)has eneough electoral votes to elect a president. method 3 is swing states. the winner-take all method  of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to poay more attention to the campain-to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are gouing to decide the election. method 4 is big states. the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population0 losy by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consitutuion. mthod 5 is avoid run-off elections. the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Mr. senate you should keep electoral ollege because it saves paper,saves gas and because it shows us the 5 methods that should be used for choosing the president. the electoral college offers a lot to wild life and also to humans by savikng trees and gas, which saves us humans money that one can spend on nessessities.                                                 ","Hi!

For most students, attending school shouldn't be an issue;however, that is not the case for some students. Although some may think that online school or video conferencing would prevent students from acquiring important skills that one would get from daily interaction, some students would benefit from online school because some kids may have more pressure to help out at home and many students have trouble focusing when around many other students. Starting off, there are plenty of students that are more relied on at home and taking online school would give them more time to assist at home. For example, my friend lives in her apartment with her older sister who is diagnosed with cancer but still works almost everyday to provide for her family, her cousin who is mentally disabled and cannot work, and her mom who has a medical condition where she has trouble walking. My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. Online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. Overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than others Furthermore, some students may have a mental disorder that would prevent them from giving their full, undivided attention in the classroom. For example, one of my friends is diagnosed with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactive Disorder(ADHD). She gets distracted very easily, especially in a classroom full of students. My friend getting distracted constantly by the noises of a student tapping their pencil, someone coughing, or simply the presence of many people in a classroom has a largely negative impact on her school performance. For her, distance school would get rid of a good amount of those distractions, and help her focus more on her schoolwork. Therefore, some students who have personal complications, and taking online school would boost their educational performance. In conclusion, while many think that taking online school would have students lack social skills for their future job, online school would have a positive impact for students who need to help out more at home and for students that physically attending school would prevent them from their full potential. Unfortunately, attending school is not the best option for some students, and having the choice of online school should definitely be provided to students who would greatly benefit from it.            ","Is Venus exploration safe? ""The Evening Star,"" although being the brightestplanet and ""twin""of earth , proves to be a very challenging place to exiamine. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is an article written by the author explaining the reasons of why exploration to Venus is very dangerous and why it wants to be explored by scientists. The article explains in much detail the dangers and possibilities that that could happen if th exploration could happen. It also gives brief information about how Venus is made up and the history of why is an intruiging planet. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author supports his idea by using data based information, question and answer responses, and the history of exploration in Venus. In the article, the author uses a lot of data based information to support his claims about the challenges of exploration in Venus. One of the most mportant pieces of information being about what type of planet Venus is and why it is dangerous. The author says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience o our own planet""(Paragraph 3). This briefly gives detail of how dangerous it is for humans to visit Venus knowing that the atmospheric pressure could easily crush a submarine that can withstand high pressures and liquefy many metals. This also supports his/her claims of why it is likely that the idea of exploring venus is impossible for these very reasons. Not only does this help support his claim; the information informs the reader about Venus and lets them know more about why it is a plant that NASA is very intrigued in. In the article, the author uses a good amount of question and answer responses that help to inform the reader and support his claims of why exploration to Venus is dangerous. A good exapmle of a question that most readers will thnk of would be ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?""(Paragraph 4). This question not only supports his claim but also gains the readers trust knowing that the author is very informed about what he/she is talking about and knows what the readers want to know about. Knowing that the author can recall much information about the dangers and expectations of further exploration to venus benefits his argument by gaining their trust and support on his claim. Using the history of exploration in Venus helps support the authors claims in many ways. Knowing the history falls back into the subect that the author know whae/she is talking about and also allows the reader to know more about the subject. ""Vensu was probably covered largely with oceans and could have suppported various forms of life, just like those on earth,""(Paragraph 4). This piece of information breifly explains the reasons of why scientists value the research done with Venus knowing that it is very comparable to earth. This information also explains the now leading dangers of Venus because of its physical changes and leads to the possiblilities given by NASA of ways that Venus can be explored. The author supports his idea of Venus's exploration being impossible by using data based information, question and answer responses, and the history of exploration in Venus. Giving the data of how Venus's state is and the leading dangers that the planet could give if explored supports the authors claims and allows the reader to now then make the decision or to be informed if Venus should be explored or not.

760,104,"You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becuase you get to see new places, you will fell good about yourself becuase your helping other countries, and will have the best expirence of your life. For example I got to ride a gondola in Venice, Italy. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. You are also helping people in the process of having fun. You can make a difference by joining the program and helping out countries who were in World WAR 2 and dont have food supplies, animals, and more things to help them live. You get to have fun, especially when the ship returns, after the animals have been unloaded. We played baseball, Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and alot more games to help time pass. You might think that its boring and it would be really long rides, but you have alot of fun, and you will get awarded those long ride by seing something you have never seen like the excavated castle, China, and Europe. If you join and help it can open up the world like it did to me, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.                                                             ","Online classes are a great idea. The benefits of online classes are the student won't have any distraction around him. Online classes are small and everyone gets there own teachers. The disadvantage is not completing the course. These are the reason why I think online classes are much beneficial then regular class. The student will be more focused on their school work. As there is no distraction around him. For example, a smart student sometimes isn't able to finish his work because they would be talking to other students during class. There is no other student just you and the teachers so you won't have any distraction. There is no distraction in their room if their alone. Online classes are known to be small. There for its good as the student would have a one on one conversation with the teacher. If the student does't understand something, and needs help the teacher being able to give more time and attention to the student. When you finish with the class your done you won't have to wait for anybody else. Basally online classes are school but independent just you and the teacher. The disadvantage are not completing the course ,because most students get distraction watching or reading other things online not related to school. Also not completing assignment or the course thinking its not school because your not going to school. You also won't be able to interact with other student. Also you can't participate in clubs or sports team after school because your talking classes online. You can pay at a private school or a team to do a after school activity. I personal agree that online classes are more beneficial to the student. The student would focused on the school work because there is no distractions around them. The teachers would give them more time and attention to the student because it's one teacher per student. If you want to do a after school activity you can pay and play a sport for the team pay a private school to do a club. These advantages to do Online classes.","Summer break is not a time that kids want to think about school, especially the homework factor. For kids, summer is a mental brain break, a much needed vacation, and a time where they can truly relax. A time where they don't have to worry about homework, test, or even due dates. I know for myself, I would rather not have to do a summer project. If I had the choice I would want my project to be student designed but out of better judgment I know the project would probably have to be teacher based. Letting kids determine their own guidelines would most likely result in some haphazard mess that would be near impossible to grade properly. Summer projects should be based off of a general guideline that's made by a handful of general study teachers. So the project can hit some of the basic studies that the kids would need to keep fresh in their mind for when the next school year starts. There are some complications that could arise when making a summer project. Many kids will not have the same resources at their disposal like they would when they're in school. We can assume that some kids will not have internet access, so it's safe to say this project should either be a paper pencil project or a hands on project like community service where the kids would apply the skills they learned in class to help their communities. Though there is always the fact that some families will be on the move with vacations and large trips, so we must keep that in mind. When having projects like this one it is easy to see that there are some problems that can be posed. There are also plenty of positives to a summer assignment, for example the kids can benefit by having to keep up their basic knowledge. That way when school comes around again it's not as hard to remember all that they learned the year before. Summer projects can also be a source for kids to develop skills, such as: problem solving, social connection, and time management. These skills would help the students advance to more adult like task that they could soon be placed before them. There are Pros and Cons to either way the project could be based and i've concluded that the teacher based project would be more beneficial for the student. Many kids will not be happy about a summer project. Hopefully they will understand the benefits they could achieve when they truly try to reach the projects full potential. ","I believe that the use of techonology to read student emotional expression is valuable. It be awesome to read somebody's emotions thorugh a machine. it would tell you alot about what a person is feeling and thats important to know. their are many excellent and well reasoned examples of why this technology is valuable. My one reason i believe this is valuable technology is if somebody was feeling depressed and was not willing to open up to anybody that individual could do self harm to himself. If they know how that individual was feeling maybe they would have helped he/she. in the passage it says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused and bored"". Then Dr. Huang says"" then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This technology could become really usful for many different situations. Thats one of the reasons of why this makes this machine so valuable. The creator of FACS[ [Facial Action Coding System] Dr. Paul Eckman has ""classified six basic emotions"". The machine can read happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. this type of technology can aid and solve world wide problem. For example what if an individual person or more were having issues with a certain subject at school but dont know how to ask for help. The Computer would make "" 3-D computer model of the face"" and they can anaylze what they might be feeling about the subject. then thats when the help comes. Another example is reading different emotions is some how very important. It can be used against people who have commited crime. An example is if a person who murdered somebody and nobody knew if he was being honest or not, the machine can read his emotions and has a better chance to tell if the person is lying or not. It can be used for celebritys and politician as said in the article. This can identify many human being feelings and it doesnt take to much time. In conclusion their are still many reasons why i believe this technology is valuable. This type of technology would be nice to have around and would be really usful. It would prevent many accidents and help solve probelms. Techonology like this cant go to waste and should be used to our adavntage. this is my reason why i think this technology is valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ","Election after election, candidates are winning the popular vote but are losing the election. The U.S. is making a terrible decision on keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors, but only need a vote of 270 electoral votes to elect a president. It would probably be best to elect a president with a popular vote to make the election fair. When voters are voting for a president they are really voting for a slate of electors. The problem with the Electoral College is that they are not giving the U.S. citizens a chance to vote for who they want as president. In 2000, with the Gallup poll, Al Gore had won the popular vote, but had lost the election  do to having over 60 percent of voters prefering a direct election. It is not fair to people that if the president they like is winning that the Electoral College can change the election by making a mistake on choosing the other candidate or take the majority vote and elect that president. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see one candidate at all. The Electoral College has been named ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"". As for Bob Dole (lost election do to the Elector College), he was correct for hiw words ""Abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a anachronism(a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the declaring the candidtate who recieves the most popular votes the winner). Even though it is true that the Electoral College elects the president, and not the people, the citezens would still want a word it electing the president. The parties selected are trusted to vote but they can make a mistake and nobody will know. In the Gore vs Bush in 1888, Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but Bush had a few more Electoral vote that Gore which made Bush win the election. Also in the Obama vs. Romney election in 2012, Obama got 61.7% of the Electoral College cpmparing it to the 51.3% of popular votes between him and Romney. Which Obama put the USA in to deep dept. By which almost all states were with the votes on a winner-takes-all basis. The winner-take-all method is used when to focus the campaign on toss-up state. The voters in toss-up states pay more close attention to the election. In Florida in 2012 election, Obama had won the state with a 29 electoral vote. Just like in Wyoming with only 3 votes. About 1/2 of the eligle American population did vote in 2012. They are the people that wanted to express the political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. People can argue that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canditate who has no hope of carrying their state which is unfair. To add it off, the Electoral college can be quite unfair to an election. They are still going to make bad decisions on which person to elect. So I would want to change the Electoral College to a popular vote takes all.                  ","Cell Phone Policy Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think Policy 1 is a better choice. So, when students use their phones in free time, when they go to class they don't need to use the phone anymore because they already used it. If a student needs to talk to a parent they don't need to be texting them during class they could just wait for some free time. Most students are tempted to use their phone because their not allowed. If phones were allowed they could just wait to use it during free time and not during class time. It will also help students pay attention during class and not at their phones. Even if phones weren't allowed, students will still bring them. So, if we allow phones it will save students from getting in trouble with teachers or with the principal. Parents will also be able to talk to their children to see if their okay. So, if we allow this policy it would help students, teachers and even parents. That is why i want you to allow Policy 1.","Everyone makes millions of choices in his or her lifetime. While making these choices, it is not uncommon for one to ask others for advice. Often, one will consult multiple people. It is always an excellent idea to receive multiple opinions when one is making an important choice or decision because this gives one an open mind to all methods and ideas, lets one know what the most reliable choices are based on how many have suggested them, and all while still allowing the decision-maker to choose the best option for himself. Consulting multiple people for ideas and suggestions allows one to have an open mind when considering every different method. This can be evidenced by my own experience. One time, I had to decide what to get with money I had received for my birthday. I knew I wanted clothes, but I could not decide which kind. I believed it would always be practical to buy uniforms for school. However, my friends suggested I purchased clothing such as merchandise, sportswear, accessories, even things that were not clothes! All of these suggestions baffled me at first, but then i realized they were actually fantastic ideas! Ultimately, I decided to compare every suggestion I received and decide what to spend my money on based off of that. I realized that buying uniforms would be a bit of a waste and that I already had plenty, whereas there was a bit of a dearth when it came to clothes I actually enjoyed wearing. Without my friends, I never would have realized that! Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others. Taking advice from others also shows which method of action holds the best results. For example, a few years ago, I needed to decide which middle school to attend. All of my friends were going to different schools, so i did not know what to do. I decided to look into the schools themselves rather than which ones my friends were attending. I looked for a school that met my personal standards and one that adults I know can tell me about. A lot of people told me that Generic_School was in my best interest and most closely fit the criteria I was looking for. They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did. No school is perfect but I believe that this one was the best for me. This proves that recommendations are always good things to take into consideration when making an important decision. Receiving multiple opinions is also wise because it gives insight on other people's perspectives while still allowing the decision-maker to make the choice that works best for him or her. An example of this is one that comes from my own experience. When deciding what to do this summer, I was given three options. I had to decide between traveling to West Virginia, traveling to Colorado, or staying here in Virginia and attending the Generic_School. My sister reminded me that going to West Virginia has not been pleasant for the two of us in the because never had anything to do. Then, my mom reminded me that going to Colorado means I will have to stay with my grandmother, who may try to convince me to call my father. Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years. The guidance from others helped me make my decision, but it was still up to me, and I am happy I was given the option to travel where I would like. In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in. ",,,,,,,

You should come on down to be a Seagoing cowboy. It is a great place of family fun. And is a good place for relaxation. Come down if your looking to have the time of your life. The clock is ticking down for this great time of fun. First of all, comming to be a Seagoing cowboy is a once in a life time event. Just think of Luke in the story.

Nevertheless, however there is also a many options for do not miss the content of the classes of the school cause you can attend classes from home by video conferencing or online, that is a good benefit for you cause you can stay in home and at the same time be able to keep on track your study, but also has a disadvantage cause not everyone has a internet connection at home and that make kinda impossible attend classes from home and also you can get confused with a topic and you have questions and your teacher could not be able in that precise moment to solve your questions then you will have to wait until the teacher could be available again. There is more disadvantages for example: you cannot enjoyed the activities that school organized or field trips that school planned, you could not spend some time with friends and also with your teachers and you could not contribute with school activities and be in clubs or sports team of the school. Those are activities that students were attend classes online from home maybe could not be able to get done. Above all the disadvantage of attent classes at home there is the same benefits that go to regular school offer to you but with a different method of learning. In conclusion, there is many ways to continue school even if you stay at home through a online site, of course there will be disadvantages but you always can see the benefit of that and you have to make more effort than normal to learn new things. I think distance learning is a good choice cause has almost the same benefits that go to school, but instead you staying at home","Summer vacation, a time where all students, no matter the grade level, can finally take a break from school and just relax. After high level stress and anxiety caused by AP exams, SOL's, and academic tests, students are awarded with two whole months to themselves. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This inevitably has led to many arguments over whether or not these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-deigned. Most definitely should students have the opportunity to design their own summer projects because it promotes creativity, teaches students skill sets needed for the real world, and finally because it helps develop interest within the students. When assigned a project with no limits, students have the ability to get as creative as possible. Personally, in 10th grade, the film class that I was signed up to take next year required me to create my own short film, the only direction listed. I created a film where the moral of the story was to ""trust the process God has written for us"" and I gathered my own materials to build props, hired a professional photographer, and rented a whole shopping plaza complex to myself. After two months of hard work, the new school year had just began. I was looking forward to go to film class more than anything and when I learned that we were going to present our short films to the entire school, I was so excited and proud, I promise I felt a burst of energy running down my body, similar to Sonic the Hedgehog all charged up. When the time came to call the winners, I knew I was first.. and I was. I was even awarded a gold medal, a trophy, and offered a program, free of cost, to create a film at Generic_City. Because students can create their own projects, they will have the opportunity to get as creative as they can, and even have a chance to excel. Allowing students to design their own projects teaches them valuable skills such as responsibility and time-management, both necessary for the real world. Researchers at Columbia University presented a case study in 2018, stating that employees who were given the ability to design their own summer projects as high school students were among the top 1% of all employees across the globe, in terms of getting work done well before the deadline, and performing best in group projects. This shows the significance of designing your own summer project, where you will need to efficiently plan out the project according to your schedule and cleverly start gathering materials necessary for the project. From past experience, when I interviewed to become a Field Director for a local political campaign, I was asked whether I had ever managed my own project, whether it be for school or outside of school. Fortunately, I was able to say that I had, as I created my very own short film. I talked about my project in depth and surprisingly, that was the only question I was asked, because I was hired before I even finished talking about my story. That proved to me that designing my own project gave me the skills I needed for a job. Designing a summer project not only promotes creativity and teaches specific skills for the real world, but also helps develop interest and passion within the student. As students are able to design their own summer project, they are given the ability to develop a passion, which may help them figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives. For example, if one who does not have any hobbies in and out of school, allowing them to design their own summer project may help them develop an interest in a subject they would have never thought about pursuing. In fact, my cousin was in college where he was still undecided about his future career path, until he figured out what he wanted to pursue from designing his own biology summer assignment. He did not know he had a deep interest for aquatic life until he interned at the local aquarium, where he wrote a lab report, reflecting on his experience and what he learned from his time interning. Today, he is named the president of Generic_City's Aquatic Life Sanctuary and held a world record for swimming in shark infested waters for more than three hours. Therefore, having the opportunity to design your own summer project helps you figure out what you want to do in the future, ultimately allowing you to prepare for your future. Designing your own summer project, whether you conduct an experiment, participate in a charity service, or create your own short film, allows you to explore different ideas that may not have been available to you otherwise. It is annoying having to complete an assignment or presentation according to how your teacher wants, but when exposed to little to no limitations when designing your own summer project, you have the opportunity to get as creative as you want, opening doors to limitless opportunities. Having this experience will help you develop skills such as responsibility, time management, planning, and organization, all of which are needed in finding a job. Lastly, if you have no idea of what you want to pursue whatsoever, designing your own experiment aids in helping you discover your secret talents and interests. ","The Facial Action Coding System (FACS)is a recent innovation in facial recognition software. It can deciper what a perosn may be feeling by analysing muscle movements and facial structure. While the technological impact of FACS is revolutionary, can a sytem like it be used in schools to give insight into the emotions of a student? The value of FACS in schools has the ptoential to become great, but as of now, FACS still has many challenges to face in order for it to become a practical and valuable part of the education sytem. Currently, FACS can only recognize ""...six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."". While this abilty is a great acheviment, FACS would have to be able to read many more expressions, such as confusion, boredom, or understanding to become useful in a classroom enviornment. If implemented in its current state, FACS might look at each student's face and would be able to pinpoint only the happy or suprised students, but typically, the happy students are not be the ones who need help. Without the capabilities to recognize more emotions, FACS would serve little purpose in this setting. The artical also states that "" Your at home PC can't handle the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Many school comtuters are out of date and wouldn't be able to run FACS either. So, in order to correctly use it, a school would have to spend large amounts of money to purchase machines with the computing power to run FACS, an investment that may not pay off for years. This expense would only be made greater by the cost of the software itself. So, while the Facial Action Coding Sytem has the ability to become an integral part of the education sytem, with its current capabilities, it would seem that FACS is not yet ready to assume the role of a valuable tool in classrooms arcross the country.      ","The United States is a government that is ruled by the people through elected representatives, but do the citizens really have power? The Electoral College proccess does not give the citizens all of the power that they shoud be entitled to. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (p10) If a United States citizen wanted to vote for a certain candidate, they would vote for electors pledged to that candidate instead of directly voting for them. As a government who is ""run by the people"", the government surely has strict power over things that should be left up to the people to decide. The eloctoral college is unfair and quite confusing to the citizen of the United States. For example, one candidate beats another by a long shot with popular vote but the other candidate wins by electoral votes, the people still have not chosen the representative. The popular vote would bring honesty to the claim that we have a government who is run by the people. A change to the election of the president by popular vote  might, in fact, cause some differences and tension across the United States but would cause more relief than it would tension. The people are tired of this out dated process and demand power. Many citizens no longer vote because they think their vote does not count, that it is all up to congress and electors in the end. If the way of popular vote were to be set in place, many people would begin to vote again and would be fullfiling their civic duty. More and more people are begining to have negative feelings towards the government and many feel like their opinions do not matter and that nothing is going to change, that it only gets worse. If enough people come togeher, we can change this old and unfair way of voting and everyone's opinions could make a difference in our nation. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politican prefrence..."" (p23) The electoral College is not a democratic way of voting because you are not voting for a president, you are voting for elctors who in turrn, will vote for the president they want despite the people's vote. The trust that the electors will vote for the party's nominee is rarely betrayed but is still a possibility. The winner-take-all system is in each state and candidates only focus on the ""swing states"". For example, in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see candidates. Voters in 25 media markets did not see campaign ads. Popular voting will erase the unfair quality of our presidential elections and bring democratic ways back to the USA. In conclusion, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (p14) The process in which a president is elected by popular votes is much more feesable and democratic. Many more citizens will be  more likely to vote under this process thus partionally bringing the nation closer to where it should be in the modern term of democracy.                                 ","Dear principle, You should let us use our phone at lunch and at free time. Here's why. we need our phones because we use our phones for calling our parents to let them know we are ok. Also if we have the internet on our phones then we can do our homework there and then we wont have to carry any more books. We need our phones to protect us and to help us in school and in our classes. Another reason is if we have phones we can write a summary on our phones so we wont waste paper . If we could use our phones in lunch then we could chat with our parents about what our homework is about. Some people would say that phones are no good, but phone help us by calling our parent and to protect ourself from people stealing our homework. So come on principle let us use our phones because we want to use our phone during lunch and our free time. sincerely, your students            ","Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they can get different perspective from other people, more option to choose from, and other ways to solve problem. Things can go really bad sometimes if someone doesn't ask for more than one option to choose from. First of all, getting different perspective from other people is anther reason for someone to ask for multiple opinions. Let's say Generic_Name was going to the mall, but when she got there she didn't know where this on store that she really wanted to go was. She asked a dude where it was and the dude said "" In the second floor"". She went to the second floor and did not find the store so she asked another person and other person said ""It's on the first floor next to the ice cream shop"". She went down to the first floor and went next to the ice cream shop got an ice cream and found the store. Generic_Name was so happy she found that store because if she had it asked the other person she would never had found the store. Second of all, having more than one opinion is better right?. For example lets say Generic_Name moved to New York and it was her first day of high school, she had know clue where her school was nether her parents. Generic_Name parents told her to just walk to school and see where other students where going. She saw this girl with blue eyes and brown hair, "" ""She looks like a high school"" Generic_Name said, so she ran up to the girl and asked ""Hey what's your name"" Generic_Name she said I'm in high school what about you"" ""Oh same"" Generic_Name said. When they got in the school Generic_Name had to go in a complete different way and Generic_Name was complete lost again. However, While Generic_Name was walking in the hallway she was asking a bunch of people to see where she had to go. She got multiple answers saying to go to the same place. See asking multiple opinion is better than one because what happen if she only had asked one person they could had been room and she could had gone to the wrong room. Lastly, Another reason why seeking multiple opinion is good, is because it can solve problems. For example, Generic_Name was having a sleepover with two friends. They were making food in the kitchen when her mom told her not to. While they were having fun cooking the oven caught on fire. Generic_Name was finking out she didnt know what to do ""AHHHHHH WHAT SHOULD I DO"" she said freaking out. One of her friends said call 911 while on the other hand her other find told her just trow water it will be fine your so dramatic. Generic_Name decide that calling 911 was the smartest or lets say better idea. 911 came and solved the problem. Overall, seeking multiple options can help someone make better choice by getting different perspective from other people, more options to chose from and can solve problems. Generic_Name found the mall she had to find, she found the place had to go and her house didnt burn down. Let's just say somethings really bad could had happen if Generic_Name didnt ask for more than one opinion.",,,,,,,
760,728,"Have you ever wanted to take care of animals? Well, I did. Hi, my name is Luke Bomberger. One day my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe with him and of course I didn't say no because I knew this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. So I went with him and that same year 1944 I decided along with my friend to sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Being a Seagoing Cowboy consists of going overseas while taking care of horses, young cows, and mules. This job may not sound very fun but let me tell you it is. For example, when I turned 18 we were sent to aboard the SS Charles W.Wooster with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. This might seem like a lot but trust me seeing the Acropolis in Greece was something special. I also had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. These were some of the most fun and extroardinary part of our trips. There were some fun parts but also dangerous parts. One time while it was raining it was my turn to check on the animals and make sure they were safe but I slipped and almost flew off board. The good thing was that a strip of metal caught me. I was relieved to still be alive but I couldn't work for a couple of days because I had some cracked ribs. Even though I had to work hard and do some risking stuff. I had a great time. It was quite an adventure that I wouldn't change for anything. Just think you could have an amazing experience like me or maybe even better, but what is certain is that you will have quite an extroadinary adventure.          ","According to scientific research, 80% of students perform better on tests and retains more information when they learn in schools. Attending school is one of the most important things for students. This is because there are many benefits of going to school and is crucial for learning, developing, and interaction. School is a place where students could facilitate their knowledge and grow. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it would inhibit social interaction, it would make them less focused and interested, and it would take away many fun opportunities. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it would inhibit social interaction. Generic_Name lives in Generic_City and her school offers the choice of attending classes from home. She decided to take 4 online classes: Math, History, Science, and English. At first, she thought she had made the best decision and was very satisfied. However, it was after about 2 quarters when she realized that she regretted the decision she made because she greatly missed talking to her friends and teachers. Because she took online classes, she wasn't able to make new friends and improve her social interaction. Socializing is a very important factor in life and it's crucial that people, especially teenagers interact with people on a daily basis. Therefore, taking online classes would not benefit students because it takes away an important factor in life. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it would make them less focused and interested. Last year, I took an online class for Personal Finance because I thought it would be better and easier than taking it in school. However, I was less motivated to complete the assignments and learn the content. I would easily get distracted and couldn't focus for a long period of time. Learning through online classes lead students to be less engaged thus makes it harder for them to concentrate. It is not the best way to learn as information is not retained longer. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it would take away many fun activities. Generic_Name takes online classes for Math, Spanish, and Physical Education. She sees no benefits from taking online classes because there is no physical activities involved and thus makes it less interesting. Generic_Name thinks it's better to take classes in schools because she can learn enjoyably and in diverse ways. By taking online classes, she cannot play educational games such as ""Kahoot"" or ""Quizlet Live"" nor can she physically play sports or team games for physical education. Therefore, there are more opportunities and activities available in schools that cannot be done though online classes. It can be argued that students do benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can learn in a more comfortable setting where they would face less peer pressure. However, the weakness in that argument is that students tend to become more lazy and less focused when learning in a more comfortable setting. By being in a classroom, students would pay attention and stay more alert because there is a physical teacher in the classroom. If students take classes at home, they would want to just lay in bed. However, studies show that students do not learn and retain the knowledge when learning in bed. Some of the reasons are because they are less engaged, less focused, and likely to fall asleep. Also, peer pressure can be beneficial sometimes because peers help others get their work done and motivate them to keep going. Also, they are able to help and suggest new ideas. As I decide which choice of learning is better, I realized that distance learning does not benefit students. One of the reason is that it decreases social interaction. I think that socializing is equally important as learning and is crucial for growing. Through online classes, I cannot directly interact and communicate with others which can lead to long lasting effects. Also, it can keep me from being fully focused and is likely for me to get distracted. This would result in the information not being retained longer. Lastly, I am not able to enjoy the fun activities and opportunities that are available in schools. Learning in school is more interesting because there are many ways that the information can be taught and it offers more activities that makes learning more engaging. I hope that more students don't choose to take online classes because it does not benefit them in any ways. ","Imagine taking a two week vacation from work after working extra hard for those vacation days; now imagine having to work during those hard earned vacation days. Now consider that on a larger scale of working roughly nine to eight months for three to two months of break, this is school. In Generic_City depending on the class there may or may not be a summer assignment, for example, most math classes require you to do a review packet or start the first unit, as was the case for statistics. English classes usually require you to read at least one book, and depending on what level English class there may be an analysis. Personal experience and differing personal conditions prove that students should not be required to complete summer assignments whether they're teacher or student designed. Personal experience has shown me that summer assignments are no where near as effective as teachers believe. As someone who has both done it and seen it happen a lot, I know for a fact that the mass majority of students don't truthfully complete the assignments themselves. They'll either wait for one person to complete it and as soon as one completed assignment is sent to someone it might as well been sent to all since each grade is pretty well connected and the use of phones makes cheating easier. The other way students will cheat is by using the internet; some assignments are one Google search away from having the entire answer key. With the mass cheating summer assignments become nothing more than a nuisance to both the students and teachers who have to read and grade the same work. Another reason I believe there shouldn't be summer assignments is because it's unfair to the students that work their butts of during the school year to have to then complete more work during their break. The school year is long but some students grind out the whole year making the most out of their education while other burn out. To these students summer assignments are the equivalent of unpaid working hours. Not to mention the long school year has more than enough time to account for review. People's differing conditions during the summer further enforce the unimportant nature of summer assignments. In my case I was in Generic_City all summer last year and spent a lot of time out in the rural areas. It was literally impossible for me to complete any of my assignments without internet. I needed to read and take notes on the first chapter of Statistics from scanned textbook pages and had a precalculus packet to complete. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if I had access to a working printer or WiFi. Sadly I had neither so I ended up having to do all my summer work in the three days I had from when I came back from Generic_City to when I had school. This was very unpleasant since I stayed home those three days completing my assignments and by the time I got back to school it had felt like I didn't even have a break. Another reason that there shouldn't be summer assignments is because some students work during the summer. My friend Generic_Name works with his dad's masonry company during the summer to help him cut cost and increase productivity. Whether it's because they're helping their parents or investing in their own future; students time becomes more costly during the summer and the benefits of summer assignments comes no where near the cost. Some teachers may argue that their work is impossible to cheat on because of xyz or that if students don't work on something during the summer or they'll forget everything they learned. To this I say that teachers don't give students enough credit and that once something has been taught it should be solid in a student mind otherwise it wasn't taught correctly. I've seen some crafty ways students try to get by an assignment that's hard to cheat on and if summer assignments where student designed this would only get worse. Some students are very determined to not do their assignments the ""correct"" way; I've seen people spend more energy trying to cheat than they would have if they had done their assignment properly. Others may also argue that to a student school is the most important priority they have; so instead of working to help keep their family fed they should be reviewing algebra II. This is absolute blaspheme although I agree that education is important it is ultimately up to the student to weigh their choices, and make the best decision for themselves. I am 90% confident that summer assignments don't fall within most students priority list. Due to differing levels of importance and my own personal experiences students should not have to complete summer assignments whether they're teacher or student designed. For the students in the past who've lost precious time from assignments where instead they could have been working, relaxing, or spending time with friends and can no longer do these things have had wrong done by them. For future students that'll find summer assignments as an even larger nuisance since it's no longer detrimental that students learn/memorize since almost everything is going to be at their finger tips instead their goal will be application. It is largely important that schools eliminate the requirement for summer assignments.      ","In the article, it talks about how a computer can caculate everyones emotional expressions. Personally, I believe that it is kind of pointless for a computer to read someones face to tell what type of mood they're in. Easily, another person can look at your face to see what mood you're in. In paragraph 4, it states that ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" For a computer to try and caculate a person's mood or facial expression is pointless. A regular human being can do the same thing. Having a computer trying to figure out someones mood is just similar as someone else doing it. Just because it is a device or technology figuring out a person's mood doesn't mean it is correct. Normally you would think since a laptop or device is advanced, that it could easily tell a person's current mood. In which, I dont agree with that at all. Basically, I do not think the use of this technology is valuable. Over all it is pointless from having a device to use for deciding someones mood. I think a person should experience finding out someone else's mood themselves instead of using a pointless device. Using a device to me is basically cheating, and it could all be better by a regular person figuring out emotions on a person's face.      ","Dear, State Sentor I feel that you should change to the popular vote for the President of the United States. That way they people can really choose who they want to be president instead of the government having to jump in and help the people choose who they want as president and some people dont vote because they know it doesnt matter. With Electoral College the voters don't vote for a president, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For example the Jhon Kerry ''voting'' if you were in Texas you voted for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to John Kerry. The Electoral College is a process that makes voting easier for the government. They have to select electors, then they all have a meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and then the counting of the eletoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors. But a major of 270 electroal votes in order to elect the President. Another example John F. Kennedy had a popular that vote would have went to him. The Electoral college is unfair to voters,because of the winner-take-all system in each state, the candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, which focuses only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It as become unfair,outdated,and irratonal. The electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism. We are in need of a change because this has been going on for years and years. So why not change it up i think it should have been done a while ago but it never to late. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Which is not every fair some people are'nt as rih as others so they sould'nt descrimate people by the way they look or dress. Because for all you know they look gurst so your not going to try and listen or understand where they came from. But they could be President material they just dont have the outter look, that everyones looking for.""Don't judge a book by it cover."" The swing states go through the most with the electoral college,because its a winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as seen in election. Voters in toss up states are more likely to payclose attentionto the campaign. They get the most feed back for the government. Also they get attention from the candidates as while. The bigger states dont get much attention.    ","I think that all students that have a cell phone should be able to use it during free time because it will help them communicate more and keep them busy. It is only fare that students should be able to have cell phone at school, then not have any cell phones at school at all. If teachers can have cell phones at school so can the students. I think if a teachers phone goes off in class that the students phone can go off in class because it is only fare, I also believe that if a student needs to be able to talk to their parents during lunch or any free time they should be able to. My reasons for this are because if there is an emergency they should be able to talk to a parent or call for help even call a friend to help or do something about the situation or problem. Another reason is so the student can be able to hang out or be in touch with other people or let someone now if things are ok. One more reason for this choose is because kids and teens need to have a life and be free and who they want to be. Another idea is so the student can let a parent or guardian know if they have to stay after school or even let a friend now to met him /her at a certain location after school. I also think that we should have a certain perspective on how the teachers use there phone at school. All kids and teens want to do is be on there cell phone at lunch or free time. some students even use their phone during class without teachers knowing or even during p. e. There should be a certain limit to where kids can use there cell phones and to where teachers can use there cell phones. Only the teacher or student can say whether they want to stop using there cell phone or even bring one to school. only a student or teacher can use a phine at school.","I love to sail. Ive been sailing since I can remember, the first things I remember about sailing is my dad telling me stories about his boat. Ive always wanted to make him proud, I wanted to be the best sailor I can be. What I didnt know was the hard work involved. My dad taught me a lot of what he knew the problem was my dad didnt know everything even if I thought he did. I tried my best to do great but I could only get so far on my own. At my sleep away camp I would work on improving my skills, I soon became friends with some of the sailing councilors. Many of them were from around the world. I would ask them for advice very frequently, I soon found out that there are hundreds of ways even to do one thing. I realized that you can do things in many ways, each time I asked for advice from someone new I would learn new ways of doing things. Something I am very great full for is that I know so many different people I can turn to for advice. I realize if I only listened to one person I would never grow and have my own ideas. Next time I need to learn something I know to ask for advice from many of my peers. After seeking lots of advice I have tried to form my own way of sailing. I believe that advice is something we should seek often. Sometimes we get scared or we dont understand something, the fact is that everyone has and we can help each other. Even though I am only fourteen I have learned that advice is the best way to grow as a person. ",,,,,,,

In my opinion being able to attend classes from home is a great idea, by let students take classes from their homes, they could get extra time to help their families in different ways, one of those ways to help their families would be; get a job. Students who decides to work and help their families; porting money, somehow they get more opportunities and experiences in life. Those students that help their families with money, somehow they are learning how to be independent. By providing classes online, somehow we are helping the parents to keep their sons and daughters in the right path, because sometimes students choice to be with the wrong people, by let students attend classes from home, their parents could be aware of what kind of people they are meeting with. By accepting the rules, students will learn responsibility and discipline as well. As a matter of facts, students have the opportunity to spend time with their families, as we all know the support of your family is the most important thing a student can have. Somehow your family have a great influence in your future, and spending time with them would get you in the right path. However, some students don't have the support from their families, which means those students got to work and sometimes they don't have the opportunity to come to school, give them the opportunity to take classes online would help them to get prepare for their life and most important;their future. In facts, online classes would help those students that are interest in continue their studies in the University or College, by give them time to prepare themselves in an specific area, and get knowledge in that area. For example, if a student is interesting in human services, he/she could get a job related with that area, specializing her/himself with what she/he wants for her/him life. Making it easier for her/him in the College or University because she/he would be prepare for whats coming in the future. On the other hand, some students don't have any support from their families and they don't speak enough English, which means the can't come to school because of their jobs. Online classes would be a great start for those students to learn English and prepare themselves. Somehow this will show the students that they are capable of so much more, the only thing they need to do is work hard, and they will accomplish all their goals. Hope is a great thing we all should have, and have hope that everybody could become or accomplish all their goals, and all those people can change the world; it means a lot to me. As a result of online classes; not only students will get benefit, but the country as well. By giving online classes, somehow we are preparing students, students who will make a different in the future, students who will make a better U.S.A for our kids. Therefore, we should give this opportunities to students who wants to become better, day by day. Isn't that what you want?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ","Summer school projects should be in students-designs over than teachers-designs. Having a student create their own project is a huge accomplishment. Reason why is because it takes a lot of time to think and create a whole project by them selves. A student design would be perfect because they can write and explain their own project that they wrote on their own. Students will have a lot of intrests and motavation with the student-design. Teachers can also learn something new about the students projects. Secondly, teacher-designs is very difficult for a student because they wouldn't have any energy or fun in what the teacher gives out for them to create a project. Not many students would try their very best reason behind it is because they find it very boring. Another reason is because they don't have a teacher to help them and have them follow through to create the project that they designed for them to do. For a example a student having his own creative project he/she designed their selves wouldn't need help from a teacher and also it's more interseting for a student creating their own project than a teacher-desgins. Third, students will learn a lot more with their own intersts with the project. Not everything has to be about school for an example it can be about economics, places, food, or anything. it will allow them to do good and they have many choices to pick. Students will gain a lot of strength on their own during that time and believe that if they can do the projects by their selves they can do anything during the school year. Teachers can see the students strengths and weakness by seeing their projects that they have created on their own and its very helpful for the teachers because they can later on help their own students create a better project in the future. finally, Students rather choose student-designs over teacher-designs. Reasons why is because students love creating their own work and have their own ideas. Many of the students are creative and love to put intersting topics, sentences, and pictures on their projects. Teachers love the creativity the students come up with. Many of the teachers are suprised on what their students have created and what they have learned over their break. It's important for a student to create and have their own work done with out any suggestings or help by a teacher. ","In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author, Nick D'Alto, provides information on FACS (Facial Action Coding Systems). I beilieve that this technology is valuable, because it could be used for educational, political, and entertainment purposes. The first reason that the FACS system is valuable is that it could help students learn. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang when he says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(D'Alto 6). This technology would make sure that every student has the help they need if they are confused. D'Alto also says ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive -- for video games or video surgury""(D'Alto 6). The FACS could be used for medical training as well as every day learning. Secondly, the FACS could be used for politics. In the article D'Alto states "" The can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.""(D'Alto 7). This applies to politics, because politions who are ingenuine would be easily caught. D'Alto furthurs this thinking by saying ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polititian or celeberty isn't being truthful.""(D'Alto 8). This shows that this field of study is already applied to politics, but that the FACS will only inporove our ability spot the fakers. Lastly, this technology could be used for entertainment purposes. D'Alto mentions that mimicking facial expression is used in the acting world. D'A;to say that an acting coach has his actors ""carefully reproduce smiling and frowning faces as a way of creating these emotions on stage.""(D'Alto 9). The FACS could help these actors more accuratly display the emotions their characters are feeling. Another way D'Alto says FACS could impove entertainment is by saying ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games""(D'Alto 6). Making the characters in video games more expressive would have the same affect as making actors expressions more accurate. It creates a sense of realism and emersion to the audience, thus inproving the experience as a whole. In conclusion I believe the FACS system could be very valuable in many ways. It can help students study, call out fake celeberties or polititians, or make entertainment better.","Dear State Senator,being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has.However,the Electoral colleges are not a really big help when it comes down to the country.Here is provided information about why they should change election by popular vote. First to start the discussion,Electoral Colleges were estblished by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote.The Electoral College is not just a place it's an important process.This college is made of electors.They have meetings where they vote for the president and vice president.The college is consisted of 538 electors.At least 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president.Each candidate that is interested in becoming president in your state has to have his or her own flock of electores.The electors are chosen by the political party ran by the candidate.This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many. Next,The Electoral college system only allows voters to vote for the slate electors. The president of the United States votes is more important then the slate electors.The president of the United States is the one responsible for the Country.Most people refer to the most common argument between the electoral college as the disater factor.Like for instance if someone wanted to vote for a specific person you would have to vote for a different amount of slate electors also depending where you lived as well. Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay. The conclusion, the president of the United states is chosen by our votes.We have the power to make this country strong,but we also have the power to make this country a train wreck.Voting is really important this can determine the fate of the country. Sincerly,PROPER_NAME                                                                                                                   ","I believe that students should not be allowed to have their phones at school and use them when they are not in class. Most students that bring their phones to school need them after school to call and see who is going to pick them up, or if they are going to go walking. If students have their cell phones with them and they are using them during non class time. They will take the advantage and use their cell phones during class. This will make them not want to pay attention in class. The phone will be the distraction and keep them from not wanting to pay attention and learn anything. The phone make a distraction to the rest of the class as well and therefore makes the learning environment a non learning class. When students don't have their phones with them in class it makes them just want to sit in their chair and just listen to the teacher. Teachers as well would say that students should not have their phones at school, because they are tired of taking it away and tired of hearing it ring or vibrate during the class time. Teachers should make the learning for the students exciting so they don't get bored and not want to make the student use their phone during class.","We should always ask for different peoples opinion on somethings so we all will have more than just one option. I know for me it is always easier to ask different people so I know what they think. This one time I had to make a big choice and I had no clue what to do. So I asked friends and they came up with great things that I had to think about. I chose one thing they said and it turned out great in the end. Asking different people for their opinion is good because I can see all of my options, so I can see witch one is a better option, and so I can see witch one is smarter. First of all, I want to have different peoples opinions so I can see all of my options. It is good to have options so that we can choose the one we like the best. It is also good to have options so I have a chance to comprehend all of my options before making the final choice. The reason I need to know all of my option is so I do not have regrets. We should also always have the ability to make our own choice if we do not like the options that our friend gave us or if we feel like the options are not as good as our own. Second of all, we should want different opinions so we can make the better choice. A reason for that is so I can see witch option seems nicer. I should always have options so I know exactly what I should do. I should always make the better choice so I do not live in regret. The reason we should not live in regret is because it is not a healthy thing to do and I would always be thinking about the ""what if"" and it is not worth it. Third of all, I always want to make the smart choice. I always want to get all the best options so I can be smart and pick the smart choice. I always need to know the right choice from the wrong choice. I order to do that is I need to make a list of all the options and make out the wrong options so I can choose the right choice. To make the smart choice I need to stay positive threw out the whole thing. A reason for that is because if we are being positive then things will work out better but if we have negative thoughts then it might not work out as we thought. In conclusion, asking different people for their opinion is good because I can see all of my options, so I can see witch one is a better option, and so I can see witch one is the smarter choice. I believe making the best choice is good because no one wants to live in regret because that would be very depressing. ",,,,,,,
375,104,"Sometimes things need to change but not in this case. Im in favor of keeping the Electoral College, normally in situations like this you have to choose one way or the other. Not with this, the electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote as stated in Source one. I know that wasnt enough to convince you so let me explain my reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college. My reasons are certainty of outcome and it can avoid run-off elections. To begin I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us certainty of an outcome. One of the reasons why this is possible is because there is a total of five hundered and thirty eight votes and thats an even number so it can happen. Many people might say what are the chances of that happening. Well it actually happend a few years ago back in two-thousand. One of the reasons for this as stated in Source three paragraph eighteen is ""that the winning candidates share of Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" As an example from the article Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis. I hope that this information has been able to push you to my side a little more but were still not done. This is one of my reasons why I think that we should keep the Electoral Vote. Finally I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it can avoid any run off elections. This is good because it solves the problem of elections in which no canadite recevies a majority of the votes cast. Some people might try to convince you and ask you what are the chances of this happening and has it ever occured before? Well I can answer both yes it can happen and it has twice, ounce in nineteen sixty eight with Nixon and a second time in nineten ninty two with Clinton. Both had a forty three percent pluarity of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters. But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ""this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us a certainty of an outcome and also it avoids run off elections. I know there are alot of decisions to be made and many things to consider but without this Electoral College we are in big trouble and more problems than you can fathom are going to happen. But in the end this is your decison hopefully you make the right one.

                                                                                                                                                             ","Soccer club. Art club. Drama club. The list goes on. These are all different extracurricular activities that almost all schools offer. Extracurricular activities can include anything from sports to bird watching, and they are all great ways to spend your time! For years, schools around the country have provided clubs and other extracurricular activities, so you should take advantage of that. All students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. First of all, taking part in an extracurricular activity helps students be more socially involved. According to Generic_Name, a guidance counselor at Generic_School, 96% of students that participated in one or more extracurricular activities have more friends. In other words, it is highly likely that a student will make a new friend or gain friends in an extracurricular activity that they participate in. Increasing the number of friends a student has would then make them more socially involved. Not only that, but participating in an extracurricular activity will increase a student's self-esteem. ""Students that have taken part in extracurricular activities show higher signs of happiness and self accomplishment,"" says Robert Hilton, a pediatric physiologist and expert in child behaviors. Put simply, students that have been in out-of-school activities are happier and appreciate themselves more. This means that if students were required to take part in extracurricular activities, they would all have increased self-esteems. Another reason is that students can find talent that helps them become successful. The Organization of Career Study, a group of people that help people study to get jobs, determined in a survey that 77% of employed people found the skills that they now use in their jobs from when they were part of extracurricular activities. Put simply, most people discovered the skills they need for work from extracurricular activities they participated in as children. If it was required for students to participate in out-of-school activities, many more people would find inner talents that could help them get a job some day. People who don't like extracurricular activities say that requiring students to join out-of-school activities deprives them of time after school to complete homework. Generic_Name, a mother of 5 kids that participate in extracurricular activities, says ""all 5 of my children come home from their after school activities at 6:00PM and have to be in bed by 7:30PM, leaving them only hour to eat dinner, take showers, complete their homework, and finish their chores."" Jameson is saying that her kids don't have enough time to do everything they have to do after school because of their participation in after school activities. However, students can still participate in extracurricular activities and have time after school for things such as homework and chores. The Virginia Directory of Public Schools, the group that runs and regulates all of Virginia's schools, published a study, determining that 90% of schools offer extracurricular activities not only after school but also before school. In other words, most schools give students the option for out-of-school activities both before school and after. Due to that, extracurricular activities do not deprive students of time to complete their homework after school. Ultimately, it should be required for students to take part in at minimum one extracurricular activity. Why? Participating in an out-of-school activity helps students become more socially involved, increases their self-esteems, and helps them find talent to become successful. If you're a student, participate in an extracurricular activity! If you're a teacher, start a new out-of-school club! It may seem small, but in the end, it might be what jump starts your future... or your whole life.","Some schools think it is a good idea to require students to complete a project over the summer. Many people would probably agree with this to assure that all students continue to learn over the break. The main question is weather the students should design the project or the schools and teachers should. There would be pros and cons to both decisions but what would be best for the students. Most students would likely would dread this project because it is something that is required to be completed over the summer when they should be getting a break. I think that if you wanted to ensure each student completes it then they should be the ones that design it, so it is in their best interest and it will be something that they want to do well on. Summer break is something that is needed for students to get a relaxing break from all the stress of school; one thing that would make it less so is having them complete a summer project. A summer project is obviously something students don't want to be worrying about during a break. If teachers designed the projects students will have much less interest and it will be looked at it as something that needs to be completed as a school project. If you have the student design the project it will be looked at in a totally different way. The project would now be something that they would want to complete for themselves. They would work harder on it and be proud of the work they have done. Another reason making the projects student designed is the best option is because some students coming from low class families don't have the materials at home to complete it or even possibly the money to buy them. When designing the project the student should and will keep this in mind so that they can ensure they have the right materials at home and if not they will make sure there is a way they can obtain them. Another problem they could run into is that there might not be adequate internet at home or even none at all. Research is a primary resource when trying to complete a project and without internet connection that is a very difficult task. Students with this issue would ensure that no research is needed or that they already know lots about the topic of their project. One main reason that summer projects should be student designed is the students could pick a topic that they have a passion about or a hobby they enjoy. If the teacher designs the project then it could be on a topic or about something they student doesn't enjoy or has no interest in. With a summer project the students designed themselves would have a drive to complete it over the summer, and not only would they complete it they would do their best work. Having a project that students designed they would want to see it completed and see it done the best way possible. With everything meticulously thought about and taken into account student designed is for sure they right decision if teachers want properly completed projects. With the students designing the projects there are many benefits from students actually completing it to being able to afford the materials. With student designed projects it will ensure that they complete them and enjoy the process of completing them, and once they are done they will be proud of what the have completed.","I think is a great idea to have this type of learning program, very helpfull for students, In my case it will help me in many ways as: 1. I can be dressing any type of clothes,( APROPIATE). 2. I won't be expose in a place that bad people can get in to and make a shooting or something like that. 3. I'll be helping my family because I will have more time for myself. 4. Im going to be able to get a job because Ill have more time. 5. We all know that home is the place we all feel comfortable,I think that if we spend time studying at home we wil like it. Here at school we are expose to so many things, You never know if anybody from outside will get in here with a gun, and will start shooting us, for no reason, or just because he is involved in bad things, this is a great idea of preventing bad things that are coming up and you dont expect them. I think another good reason is that we wont be expose to this weather that changes frequently, sometimes we think is a joke but you dont know how bad this is for us,this way we will be at home with a good temperature ready to study. In my house most of the mornings there's nobody because my mom works, and my dad too, so I think I will be focus more in what the teacher is telling me. I think this method will also help my teacher, She will have more time, She won't be worrie about being on time. I think this will also help the school, they will be saving some more money, they will save gas, and space. I have a friend that lives in baltimore but in the place he lives theres basically no school around, Is a rural area so he had to study online an this change his life in a good way because he didn't knew about it till my uncle told him abpu it, and he request for an application form online and they approved, He was so happy because finally he made it and he was able to study without traveling to other state just to study","We don't realize it, but pollution has gotten worse. Although, with the help from Columbia and Germany's bans on cars, we can change that. Why drive someplace that's down the street, when you could save the gas and money and walk, or maybe even ride a bike? All around the world people use cars to their advantage and even though it seems like just a little ride around the block, it's really making more pollution spread out into the air. Vauban,Germany has made the decision to ban all cars. There are two ways to keep your car: by buying a parking lot space down town, $40,000, along with a home; or large car garages at the edge of the development. Taking away stress is another advantage for giving up your car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walking doesn't add pollution to the air. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe; and up to 50  percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Bikes and scooters have the same effect as a car, just with less pollution. Just by riding a bike you are not only not sending out pollution, you are getting a free workout. Just by even car pooling you are saving your country from being overthrown by polluted air. ""All of our development since the World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Golberg, an official of Transportation for America, ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid."" Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. The car is one way to get around town, to travel, to car pool. However, with one less car we could change the way we live in the future. Imagine, less smog, more people walking and riding bikes to get to places, and less people being stressed. We could be setting a forever-lasting trend.    ","The Creation of the Thing ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions-- like math homework?"" do you think that using a computer to deturmane our feelings is right? To me thats cool, maybe even unbelievable. Is the use of computers,emotions,and muscles the key to feelings. Many people can't seem to find what feeling mona lisa is showing, sometimes you cant see what emotion your friend is having. Two professors have decided to invent a software which it can detect the feeling of a person or a painting. stated in paragraph 1, "" the software is the lastest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This shows that the professors are trying to invent and new and improve way to figure out emotions within the human and paintings. They are creating a software for the computers. Also stated in paragraph 3, "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscle."" Not only can the computer detect the feelings, it also makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting. Everyone has emotions but some you just cant tell how they are feeling, well now you might not have to worry about that i do believe that this software is going to be very valuable to the students, in very many ways. its going to help them with observing the way the looks and creses in the face is. Stated i paragraph 3, "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" There are many emotions but these are the most common. Also stated in paragrapgh 4, "" In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emmotions."" No matter what the person is feeling. if they feel sad, worried and happy all at once the software can still detect the emotions of this human or painting. You know that it takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it takes why less muscles. just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling. when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7, "" In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the coners of your mouth."" with just useing a couple of muscles it can add a whole different facial expression. Like if you sqint your eyebrows and then also smile and also close your eyes a little bit I know that i wouldn't be able to tell weather they were happy or angry. just by changing on muscle movement it can change the facial expression. Also stated in paragraph 8, "" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" not only is this cool but its differentuse one other different muscle and people can tell that your smile isnt really and happy smile. This software is a great idea to help many people just understand the emotion of others with the knowledge of computers, emotions, and muscles they will be able to know how anyone is feeling just by the three main reasons.","Dear Principal, In my own prospective, I think that students should be allowed to use their phones in school and use them during their lunch period plus their free time. Option A is not only fair to the students but to the teachers as well. It gives students more freedom but there has to be some consequences. If you automatically say that phones are allowed just not in class, us kids are obviously going to take advantage of that. We are going to use them whenever we can. In the hallways, when we take ""bathroom breaks"", skip classes, or hide their phone from their teacher and text during class. We are going to fight against it but there are ways that you can enforce the rules. In the hallways, phones should not be out during school hours. We would pay more attention to what we are texting rather then looking right ahead or paying attention to our surroundings. It can cause multiple accidents. I encourage for security to be around every edge of the halls and actually get kids to class by organizing the past so people won't be walking on top of each other. And in high school there should be no passes to students to go to the bathroom unless there really is an emergency. A lot of students would cut a part of class just to get to their phone. High school is not like Elementary school. Staff members can't be looking out for every single student in a school. But they could keep them from skipping classes. Security should be going around the hallways all the time to make sure any student isn't just roaming around in the halls. If there is, they should make them go to class unless they have a pass or a note to excuse them from the time being out of class. And the biggest issue of all is students texting during class. Even if teachers say to turn them off and hide them, we are still going to have them out when teachers are not paying attention. And that is an issue everywhere, no one really listens. There is a way teachers can stop it. It's impossible to have an eye on every student, that's why they should dispose of it right before class. There should be a bin where students put their phones. If any student has a phone during class and get caught, they should be the ones getting in trouble. Detention may be too much but just saying that there would be big consequences would really scare them. I am not saying that doing this would make everything all good. Students these days really rebel against the teachers and the staff. They may not listen the first time but they will get used to the rules and at some point they might have a change of mind. This could make a big difference, make the school a better place, and a better learning environment for those who really care about their education. It could even get the rebels on the right track. Whatever you chose some will go along with, I'm just saying that a lot of kids won't want to go to your school if you don't let student have phones at all and they would really be against you. Sincerely, a concerned student",,,,,,,
375,220,I favor in to changing election by popular vote because it would be more fair to the people who are running and it would be quicker to decide who is president. I think its better to be elected by popular votes because people actually like the person for a reason and actually listening to what that person is saying and actually agrees what he saying and they see something in that person instead of just having congress vote count mostly instead of the citizens. And its not really fair that a person wins just because of his or hers own group of electors gets him to win it should just be based on popularity because its fair as i said before for example what if their was some person running for president and he was not really good to run the United States and yeah some people voted for him but he wasnt as popular but he won the election because of his group itb wouldnt really be fair because  the people perferd the other guy better in office. Why because ethier people liked what he had for the states n what he would offer to the people and actually help us live good and thats what is important for the state its all about the people wants because thats how we will live right. Also the person running for office might not have any electorial votes because theie campaigning wasnt heavy in a certain part of the state so they would oviously vote for the other person because they really havent seen what that person has to offer to them and he will have less succes in winning the election. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate witch means that they can relie on  their state as much so they really wouldnt pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by a popular vote but of course no voters vote swings a national election. And thats why I favor in popularity votes because its more fair for the canidates and its a better system in electing a president.            ,I mean i think its a bad idea and a good idea. Well my opion on it being a good idea is because some students like trying out for new stuff and some dont. For me I would like to stay home and eat food and be on my phone. But other kids like doing stuff like that and enerfearing into some stuff. but the bad point of veiw is some students dont like to do stuff like that and make them have to participate into stuff like that. And spending a lot of time and always working. But no I really dont like it because I have a lot going on with school so I really dont want that and I dont like sports and really dont like too run. So its a no for me because im not into doing something if I havent cheaked it out yet. But I mean I could try it it depeneds on what it is. Like soccer I aint doint that because try outs are over and im really bad at soccer so yea depends on what it is.,"Do the students make up the school or do the teachers? Yes, the teachers make up the school. So if the teachers make up the school, should the students get a say on what work they have to do. I dont think you can teach yourself without knowing what you have to do. So if it were up to the students they would probably slack off, Instead of really pushing their self to their limit. Teachers should design the summer projects, so the students can really learn something. Personally if I got to design my summer project. I would do something easy to get a good grade. I feel like the summer projects are to hard, so I would make them easier. Now if you look at it from a students' point of view the teachers that design the summer project aren't worried about what the student can do. For example if I see a worksheet that is to hard I just give up. I can't myself to do something i can't do. The work for students is really hard because they still have so much to learn. But it doesnt give them the right to slack off. Students can't learn with a worksheet they need like some teaching to go with it. Teachers should design a little extra so that the students can actually learn something. All that's really going on is the students working on their skills. Therefore, I believe teachers should design all the summer projects.    ","The idea of letting kids take classes at home is not a great idea. Not only would students hate more technology based education causing them pain in the eyes, but they would have no one to talk to at home. No friends, no classmate, just at home by themselves. There should be another option for this. some students would not be comfortable with the idea of someone teaching them in there house. What if there was an outage of electricity, the student would go a whole week without learning causing them to forget the knowledge they leaned last week. I also wounder if the school would provide the right equipment for the student. Including a monitor, headset, or a chair. I know students, as my self could not afford a $200 monitor. lets say there is a family with 5 children. That would mean 5 monitors, 5 chairs, 5 headsets, and 5 rooms. Or they can share but that would cut into the other persons learning time. Another reason why school should not be at home is the fact that schools would be empty. so many students would try to stay at home that teachers would be jobless, the kitchen staff would be jobless. so much unemployment would have a huge damage on the economy. I think there should be an option for the parents, can they afford there kids to stay home, can they be trusted that they will get up and turn on that screen or take a shower once in a while Education isnt meant for it to be taught at home its meant to have a one on one conversation with a teacher, it is meant to help a child grow and to face real life experiences like talking in a group, giving a presentation, or reading body language. In conclusion there should not be any school at home.","Cars are a main aspect in our daily lives, but how would it be if we limited car usage throughout the world? Places would be more environmentally friendly and the streets would be less congested. So why not give it a shot, what could possibly go wrong? If we limited car usage, it would be easier to get to our destination. Places would be more compact with less space for parking so that stores would be built close enough for us to walk there rather than driving to the nearest mall. Less malls would mean less parking lots, meaning sotres would be built along main streets rather than a highway. Not only does less cars make it easier to get to the places we need to be, but makes people happier. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, a city in Germany, limited car usage making their streets ""car-free"". Making streets car-free made people way happier, since they are usually tensed when having a car. Limiting car usage would help the environment. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States? Imagine how polluted it must be in New York where the main streets are congested with cars! In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris bans driving to clear the air. Congestion was down 60% in France. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France which pollutes the air big time. Would you rather live in a world full of polluted air and congested streets rather than walking or biking to places way closer and saving the earth at the same time? You decide.            ","I don't think it would be worth the money to put in technology in a classroom to see what a student is feeling, because not everyone wants everyone knowing what they are feeling. What if that student just wants to be left alone? When I'm mad I don't want everyone knowing what's going on, I'd rather not talk to anyone unless I ask them for help about the situation. If they did put the technology in a classroom to tell what every child is feeling everyone would know each others business. In the article it stated that it could help teachers know if the child is bored or confused, but does that child want the student to call him or her out on it? Probably not because if that student is struggling in class they don't want everyone knowing, if that student is struggling or confused then they need to ask the teacher at a seperate time if they don't want everyone to know how they struggle academically. Not everyone is a emotional person they don't know how to share their feelings but they probably don't want some machine telling them how they feel and how they are feeling by how they look. Because anyone can fake a smile or a happy moment, but if that student doesn't know how to express themselves without a machine telling them, then they most likley don't want everyone else knowing what they're going through. Technology has advanced majorly in just the past few years, but we are humans and we need to be able to show our emotions without a computer telling us how were feeling by how we look on that day. We all have bad days and we all have good days but on the bad day if that computer tells me I'm depressed then I could believe that and my mental state not be stable anymore because that computer told me I was depressed based on how I looked and felt one day. We as humans need to learn how to express ourselves without using an emoji on our keyboards. Technology has made our lifes easier but again has changed too many things in todays world. ","Dear, TEACHER_NAME Many kids and parents thing that you should not allow students to have phones at school at all because of our grades. But to be honest I think you should pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reason why I think that you should pick police number one is because there are some times when teachers don't let us go to the office to use the phone and teacher are not allow to let students use the phone in the class. Some times we feel so bad and we ask for permission to go to the nurse and teacher don't allow us go or if we go to the nurse they don't do nothing to make us feel better. Another reason why I think you should pick police number 1 is because what about if there is on accident in our families how are we gonna be able to know. I know that our parents can call the office to let us know but I think we should still have our cell phones with us. When our parents don't know if they are gonna be able to know if they are gonna come and pick us up from school, how are we gonna be able to know. If you let us have our cell phone in school we promise you that we are not going to use our cell phones during class time. We are not gonna bring our grades down. Well TEACHER_NAME this are my reasons why I think you should pick Police number 1.      ",,,,,,,
375,728,"Voting for whos the next president can be hard. Theres so many things to consider, like who will support you the best and make the right desition. The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote. I believe that we should go with the popular vote method. When voting like this its not a confusing, Theres no missing ad campaigns, and in the winner take all you dont rule out another persons elector for his chose. Using popular vote for electing our president is better then Electoral College i believe because its not that confusing. In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they give their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather then president a then the state votes for president b. In ppular vote both presidents are trying to win you over so they will make a campaign. what if you never see the campaign? This is what can happen in the Electoral College method. If a president knows that a certain state will not vote for them then the president wont perade around there. Therefore the state cant make a correct decision. The popular vote method is very diffrent as you have seen in the paragraphs above. One reason I prefer the popular vote method over the Electoral College is do to the winner take all in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair. So when it comes to election day which method will you chose? Electoral College or popular vote you know that im going to stick with popular vote because Electoral College can be confusing, the ad campaigns  cna be unfair and ruling out the opposing electors.    ","I agree with having students do extracurricular activities after school, I feel like it would be a good idea to have not every student but, students that will participate involved in some of the extracurricular activities. This could help the students that get into bad things outside of school do better for themselves. I feel that the students would have fun and would enjoy their time doing the activities provided for them. I agree with students participating in extracurricular activities but, I don't think every student should be involved in the activities for the simple fact, all students do not participate in the activities, in my opinion the activities the principal is providing for the students should be a privilege. I think one of the activities should be homework club, for the students that need to catch up on work that is pass due or things the students may need help on. Without good grades us students shouldn't be able to have the privilege to be participating in the fun things until our grades are better. We should have different things for the activities so everyone can try new things, in case they never seen it or tried it and end up liking one of the activities provided. Another reason i agree is that, some of the students like being after school instead of going home or maybe the students that are going through things at home can stay and do the activities and have fun, I have a list of things that i think would be good activities for students such as basketball football step team/dance team music/rap/sing band practice soccer softball/baseball acting The activities should be a fun experience but also a learning experience, the students should have fun and learn from it as the have fun doing the activities. Hopefully the extracurricular activities should have the students more active, productive, engaged, and more than happy to stay for more activities.","During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education. When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students. A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project. In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses. Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.","Having a classroom from the comfort of home has always been an idea floating in people's head. Different from home schooling, online classes or sessions can now be done through technology. Now, video conferencing can and is being used today in colleges and other places around the world. could be very beneficial to students because it can be less stressful and they won't miss any lessons. Online classrooms should be less stressful for students. They won't have to deal with as many policies as they would in a normal facility. For example, dress code, library, and after school violations should immediately be out the window. Another reason why it could be less stressful is because they won't have to deal with as many people. Cyber bullying is still going around, but there shouldn't be any physical bullying. They also won't have as much drama as they would in school, which could result in better focus on their tasks. It would help them get better grades with less stress. Since the classes are online, they shouldn't miss any lessons. They will have an entire day to work on an assignment that would most likely be due the next class. An entire day is more than enough time to get everything done for one class. Even if the students are sick, they won't miss a lesson. They won't be marked absent and wouldn't have to do any make up work, they will already have the lesson there for them. As stated before, they ""shouldn't"" miss any lessons. Occasionally, students procrastinate and won't get work done. They like to do other things that grab their attention, rather than work on an assignment from a teacher. The fact that classes would be online shouldn't restrict students from getting assignments done. They still have their responsibilities to take care of. There are no excuses. Online classes can be beneficial to students. It can be less stressful and they won't have any days off. They will still have their responsibilities, as if they were in an actual facility,to get their work done. There would be less problems and more time for them to do their work. Students should be able to stay on task and be in the comfort of their home. If the school board were to make this change, it would be very beneficial to students.","There are several advantages when you limit car usage. One, you will reduce greenhouse gases. Two, you will lower the stress level of people when they thinking about driving. Three, young people will decrease their amount of driving. Overall, limiting car usage can help fellow citizens. Limiting car usage wil reduce greenhouse gases. In Source 1 the passage states that passaenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. While we limit car usage you will not only help reduce greenhouse gases,but you will help reduce air pollution. When theres no air pollution there will be a clean atmosphere. Furthermore, limiting car usage can benefit the enviorment. Limiting car usage will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Everyday people have to plan before they drive. Sometimes when people plan for driving they get stressed thinking about if theirs traffic or what if the road is closed. In Source 3 the passage states that rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. Furthermore, limiting car usage will limit the stress level of people thinking about driving. Limiting car usage will decrease young people's amount of driving. In Source 4 the passage states that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license. Another study in Source 4 was found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If their's less young people driving then there will be less accidents occuring. Overall, limiting car usage will keep young drivers from injurying themselves. Either way limiting car usage will help our fellow citizens in general. This will reduce greenhouse gases. This will lower the stress level of people when they are thinking about driving. Also, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of young people driving. Futhermore limiting car usage will help us citizens.    ","Is Technology Valuable in the Classroom? New software has been developed that improves the accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software can now detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Facial Action Coding System has promising applications for a variety of industries. Mona Lisa being on of the pictures used to detect her emotions that were captured long ago. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. If the Facial Action Coding System was apart of the classroom, it will essentially distract students from their work. If school corporations were to bring Facial Action Coding System into the school, I personally think the schools should make it an elective class due to the fact that it may make students distracted from their work. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of the Facial Action Coding System classified the six basic actions as happiness, surprise, amger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. During the process, each expression is compared against a neutral face, also showing no emotion. Although, I think that having the Facial Action Coding System in schools, we perform ""calculations"" on one another each day. Humans can tell when a friend is feeling ""down"" or simply having a bad day. Just like when humans are watching movies, one can figure how the person is feeling by watching the actions around them happening or by their expressions presented on their face. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Having a computer in a room would also help modify the lesson as if the teacher were there. Today, most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion communication making it almost impossible to figure out what one is thinking or saying. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. Each person expressed their emotions differently. Empathy may happen because we unconsiously imitate another peroson's facial expressions. Designing the Facial Action Coding System helped humans learn the process of changing facial expressions and reading each others minds and emotions. Whoever would have thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!","Dear principal, I am a student of your school and i want to tell you which policy i think is better. i think policy number 1 is good because. that's when students get to have free time and so they wont be getting in trouble. also that way students don't have to be taking it out during class and they know that they can wait till they have free time. To continue i also think it would also be good because. when many kids be taking them out in class they be getting their cell phones taking away. but if you let students take them out during lunch hour they don't have to worry about getting in trouble. also some parents want their kids to take their cell phones incase for an emergency. and so that students could call their parents incase they forgot something. further on after their free time is over you can take every student to their locker and make sure they don't have their cell phones so they wont use it during class periods. and my final reason is because if that way students can avoid getting in accidents in school if they are desecrated in the hall ways. that way students can also get caught up in school work. and not be failing classes. sincerely your student            ",,,,,,,
375,825,"The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote. I'ts seen both ways but is there anything we can do about it? Good or Bad. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The group of electors for your state are selected by the cnadidate""s political party. So when you vote for a specific candidate you are voting for the electors he is supported by. So why do people want to aboplish the electoral college completely? Because there are some serious things wrong with it. ""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (Source 2, Paragraph 4). How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midset and vote for the wrong candidate...Yes that is poosible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their chosing so therefore there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by. ""In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a diect election"" (Source 2, Paragrph 1). The people don't want the electoral college anymore, Who's to say they ever did? But even know some don't want the electoral college there are some who prefer to keep it. ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is ""unlikely to be a succesful president""( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected. Concluding, both sides have reasonable arguments to if the elctoral college will stay for good or be abolished completely. But it's up tp you to decide which side your own because this is a democracy.. Isn't it?                                    ","Do you want to do something you like? If so, then you should join the School's extracurricular activity. There is so much you can do like soccer, art, and more!

Once you have choosen an activity of your choice, you will never want to leave. There are so many things you can do, you may even make a new friend and get closer with that person. You can tell all your friends and people you know to join any activity they enjoy, give them a hand and help them choose an activity they like or you can tell them to join your activity. Make a person feel welcome, show them around, and show them what you like and tell them about it and ask them what they like, let them tell you about too. Have a great time, do want you wanna do, be kind to others, make a new friend. Overall we just want you to have a good time. Have fun, we all want the students to have fun and enjoy the activity they have choosen. Do something you like, and not because, someone tells you to do an activity you don't like. Make your own decsions and don't let anyone to force you to take something you don't like, yes you may tell that person to take this, but you can't force them. we really think that doing an activity a student likes will make them enjoy it and let them have a great time. we really want students to be more involed, that's why we think the school should have activity for students. We want students to just have fun and enjoy. Should students join an activity? Yes, because it will entertain them, and they learn a lot of new things, they will also make new firends. Doing something they will like and enjoy, will make them want to do the activity. Students should be able to do any activity they want and like. We just want to them to be entertained and learn more. ","Summer projects are a good way to make sure that the students are continuing to learn over the summer. Most projects are designed by the teachers, and some are designed by the students. Personally I would like to think that having a project designed by a teacher would benefit me more. When a project is designed by a teacher, it insures that students know exactly what their teachers want, and makes sure that the students are not choosing extremely controversial topics. Also, students who are given teacher designed projects, are generally more relieved. In all, summer projects that are designed by teachers are usually better when it comes to providing detailed instructions on what to do. When a student knows what a teacher specifically wants for their project, it typically rasises the score of the final product. For instance, when I get a paper with detailed instructions on what to do, it raises my score. This is due to the fact that I have done absolutely everything that the teacher is asking for. It provides me with a list of things that I need to do in order to fully complete my work. Teachers who design their projects often choose topics for the students to talk about. This helps with making sure that the students do not choose anything that is too extreme for school. For example, I typically recieve a paper listing several names of books that my teacher is asking us to read and write an essay on. It helps by making sure that students don't pick books that are too short, too extreme, or books that are not advanced enough for their grade level. It narrows down the number of books to a small amount that are all similar in length and that are at the students reading level. In all, teachers that design their projects, for the students, often give only a few ideas that a student can choose from to use in their projects. Which, in favor, limits the number of bad topics that a student might choose from. Students are relieved when it comes to having detailed instructions for projects. It also insures that the students won't have a project that is either too short or too long. Instructions provide students with information that helps the student complete their work in time for school. Students who are given instructions are often done faster and usually have a more developed and completed work. I, for one, appreciate when a teacher gives me a project with all of the needed information on the instructions. This helps by giving me a list of tasks to complete. For instance, when creating a presentation, it is helpful when teachers give students a list of required information that needs to be included in their presentations. I understand that some projects need to be designed by the students. Projects that may need to be student designed are ones that include physical activities, and scientific/research projects, which requires students to conduct research and run tests based on what their topic is about. Other reasons why some people might choose to let students design their own projects is that they may not have the time to create and fully develop a list of isntructions and ideas that could potentially help both the teacher and their students. In conclusion, I personally believe that when a teacher designs a summer project, it relieves both the stress of the student and the teacher. Teachers do not have to worry about whether or not they will recieve a piece of work that is too extreme for school, a work that is not advanced enough for the student, or a piece that isn't completed. Also, the students are more likely to understand what they have to do: and in all, students are more confident when it comes to presenting their topics. This is due to the fact that the teacher has provided them with the necessary information that the students need to have in order to hand in a complete work.","When considering distance learning, one has to be ready and willing to commit to hours of staring at someone on the screen teaching a topic they are not familiar with. Although distance learning is beneficial for those away from campus or from the educational institution, distance learning will not benefit students academically. By offering distance learning, students will be able to take advantage of their access to the internet to further themselves and find answers. Although distance learning is a cheaper alternative to moving in order to attend the university of your choosing, but by doing so, you will be missing out on an educational experience one on one. Distance learning stunts a student's growth because staring at a screen for hours results in more harm than good. It tires one out and then procures a below average performance that hinders a student's overall education. Distance learning also tempts a student's academic integrity, especially when they have ready access to the internet, which is a whole database of answers. A student can easily cheat by looking up the answers on an another tab or going on another piece of technology such as a phone, to search up answers. For instance, students in Generic_City, China were pushed to attend school online due to a city quarantine thanks to the Coronavirus. Professors and teachers alike informed their pupils of apps they have to download and would hold video classes where students would watch and write down notes, but ultimately, some wouldn't log in, and others weren't able to hear their instructor speaking either due to connectivity issues or other students talking. This resulted in students cheating and finding answers online and rating the apps one star to the point where the app would be removed from the app store. Distance learning produces individuals who don't put their best work in and perform well, below average. Another thing distance learning enables is that it allows students to falsely claim that they understand material when in reality they don't due to boredom. Not only does distance learning threaten integrity, it also hurts one's ability to fully grasp the material being taught. Youths possess a short attention span, and if not entertained or immersed in what is being taught, they will slip into boredom easily and will do whatever it takes to be done of it. For example, when I used to be a Quran student, I had to video conference my Quran teacher on Skype every Sunday and they would listen to me recite a memorized surah or prayer in the Quran. At first my interest was piqued, my knowledge of my religion would be increased, but soon it became a chore. Something I loved doing became something expected of me and mistakes were looked down upon, not learned from. So I would cheat. I'd look up the Quran part I'd have to memorize and say it out loud to my teacher and I was met with praises. My three hour sessions were cut to two due to my proficiency and soon I was done with it. If I were to be taught one on one, I would've excelled and would've delivered my best rather than taking the easy way out. By allowing students to learn at home, they will have their integrity threatened and their interest diminished due to tediousness. Furthermore, distance learning gives way to privilege when approached my different perspectives. Enrolled lower income students may have challenges receiving an education when their wireless connection suffers, or their laptops sputter and die. Kids who have a troubled home life may also prove to be struggling when learning when they constantly have parents fighting or no personal space to do their work. Other things to take mind of is the social aspect of distance learning. If kids are encouraged to take classes from home, how will they be able to work and communicate with their peers and soon the outside world if they are only conversating with people behind a screen? Distance learning robs them of building meaningful connections with people in real life and learning how the world works when placed in different situations. Overall, distance learning prohibits something that all students and people will have to face; change. Whether its new people in different classes, or a new classroom or a new teacher, there is limited space for students to experience change in the real world. In conclusion, distance learning seems to be a perfect fit for those who yearn to be focused and for those who prefer to be alone, but overall distance learning is not beneficial for students. By learning from home students will be lethargic, underperforming, and less susceptible to change. It encourages individuals to take the easy way out and will therefore pave way for underperformance. Holding classes in person gives students a chance to grow and flourish with others as well as adapt to new situations and people. ","Cars are a main aspect in our daily lives, but how would it be if we limited car usage throughout the world? Places would be more environmentally friendly and the streets would be less congested. So why not give it a shot, what could possibly go wrong? If we limited car usage, it would be easier to get to our destination. Places would be more compact with less space for parking so that stores would be built close enough for us to walk there rather than driving to the nearest mall. Less malls would mean less parking lots, meaning sotres would be built along main streets rather than a highway. Not only does less cars make it easier to get to the places we need to be, but makes people happier. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, a city in Germany, limited car usage making their streets ""car-free"". Making streets car-free made people way happier, since they are usually tensed when having a car. Limiting car usage would help the environment. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States? Imagine how polluted it must be in New York where the main streets are congested with cars! In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris bans driving to clear the air. Congestion was down 60% in France. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France which pollutes the air big time. Would you rather live in a world full of polluted air and congested streets rather than walking or biking to places way closer and saving the earth at the same time? You decide.            ","techonology called the ficial Action coding System enavles computer to identify human emotions is really good thing. we would like to know If they are lying about their emotional. Dr. Huang is really smart but I think he is right. First,computer to identify human emotions is really good thing because we would know If they are lying to us or no. Acoording the text "" can we actually ""calculate""emotions like math homework"",I think they got the right point because our emotional is like calculate. They have to calculate are we really sad or happy. Another example from the text"" The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". I Hope our school should do like that so people we could help other people whenever we are sad. Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. Honestly, I used to cheat on my girlfriend too back in the day but the good part is that we don't know facial action yet. If we both know that time I bet she will say"" let do this because I want If you are cheating on me"". Still right now she don't know that I cheat on her but we are already broke tho. I saw on social media a lot Boyfriend and girlfriend did that. When they know they both got cheating,both of them feel wierd. People is really good at hide thing I hope we are did Facial Action so we could know how is lying or nah. Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing."" The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF lllinois.""Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say"" I want to meet with Dr. Huang"". Conclusion,every year different technology is coming out,I can't Imagine what is going be like in 20 year later. What kind of technology would be going out.",Policy one is the right one to do because you might have miss the bus what are you going to do if you don't have a phone.

Or you are sick and you need to go home. plus it cant hurt some one or yourself so I think it is dumb that you can not bring a phone to school and that's why I think its dumb that you can not bring a phone to your school if you have them turn down and if do not have them out in class and if you do bring them to school they need to give them back to you at the end of class or at the end of the day .,,,,,,,
500,104,"Have you ever considered participating in an extracurricular activity? I'm sure there are many students who have considered joining an extracurricular activity, but have never been given the opportunity. Extracurricular activities can be a source of friendships, entertainment, college opportunity, healthy coping, opportunity, and even prevention of drug and alcohol use. Now our principal has decided to to make extracurricular activities mandatory. So now you have to pick the extracurricular activity to join, There are many opportunity such as the yearbook club, sports, and the student council. I believe that extracurricular activities should be mandatory for students in public school do to the mass amount of opportunity they provide. Enrolling in extracurricular can improve your chances of getting in to a good school in college. Colleges aren't just looking at grades, they are also looking at what your interests are. Due to the recent boost in competetion among colleges the aren't just looking for the smartest people, they are also looking for people who are athletically inclined or if you were one of the lead members of the debate team in high school. Extracurricular activities give the students entertainment or a distraction from there home life and school work for a few hours. Some students may not have anything to do at home or might live with and abusive family member, and the student gets a break from that. On top of that the student would also be engaging in a better social life and may be able to open up to others about there home life. This generation is known as ""the most depressed generation."", or ""the most suicidal generation."", although it is true that the depression and suicide rate have been shown to go up in this generation i think extracurricular activities can assist that. Extracurricular activities can be a distraction or as people in the physch like to call it a ""Healthy coping method."", this shows that since an extracurricular activities can be used as a means of distraction it can help prevent self harm and depression, and students will be more open with others and can maybe share there problems. Sports and exercise release the same endorphins that are released when someone cuts them self so obviously exercise is the better solution We have already have been of over that extracurricular activities can be used as a healthy coping method, it can not just prevent self harm, but also drug and alcohol usage. A lot of highschoolers end up doing drugs and alcohol at some point in there high school career which could lead to further usage as an adult. Some highschoolers use these as entertainment or a coping method, but since they have the extracurricular activities at hand they don't need to use this as unhealthy coping or entertainment. Joining the student council will give you the opportunity to make change in your school. Colleges are looking for students who participate in extracurricular activities. Participating in an extracurricular activity can reduce the rate of alcohol and drug usage. Participating in extracurricular activities can lead to friendships and bonds made in and out of school that will last forever. Participating in extracurricular activities can reduce the depression and suicide rate in schools. Extracurricular activities give the students the opportunities to make a difference in their lives.                         ","In more recent human years, travel has grown and grown and grown, when taking a horse from one side of America to the other would have taken countless years in the past, now we get in our cars, hop on to US1 and drive for a few days and we are on the other side of the country. Cars have connected people all over the world, allowing them to reach loved ones, and friends and family easier then ever. Although with every good thing comes some bad. Cars run on gas, and when  they use the gas they cause pollution, that is slowly destroying the earth, second driving a car can encourage people not to walk and exercise since they can just push a pedal and go as fast as they need for as long as they need, finally running a car costs lots of money. Having to fix up the car and pay for gas to run the car, people without cars would have lots more money to spend on other nessesities like food and water. But with todays technology it doesent really matter if you drive or not, cars are becoming more fuel efficient and even hybrid, the amount of benefits to negatives really does not balance out, being able to go anywhere or being 0.00000001% help for the environment, also driving cars creates jobs for people everywhere, designers, mechanics, gas station workers, etc. So although, yes not driving would help the environment, it would also cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs, crippling the environment and destroying america, a country that basically survives off car sales. When your wife is giving birth and it takes 30 mins to drive to the hospital, are you going to be happy that you sold your car to save the environment?    ","Transportation or cars will always have an huge impact on the economy. Think about how many people use cars today. Driverless cars has many positive aspects, but lets focus on the negative outcomes. Driverless cars would change the entire world! Look at the companies making computer-driven cars compared to the cars that need humans. There are hundreds of places manufacturing cars that considerably need humans. If computer-driven cars take over sommany people woukd lose out on jobs that they have. If people lose their jobs most would not be able to afford driverless cars. If the technology of the car was to fail and there is an accident there is question about who should take the blame. Safety is one of the major concerns. The manufacturer or the driver? This issue alone can cause conflict. If certain laws change the entire technology of thounsands of driverless cars must be updated,right? With so much debt at our hands I do not believe that driverless cars should be anywhere close to growing closer to the people by 2020.     ",The term student athlete has the word student first. I believe that they should have a grade average of at least a B. The students must realize that there work will take them further than there athletic ability. If someone truly wants to succeed in life they can't just rely on their ability to play a sport. A student athlete has the word student in it first and there's a reason for it. If a student wants to participate in a sport they must excel in academics first. The athlete should earn the right to be playing before they actually do. They can't just ease through school and think that they'll be ok. Most athletes don't make it on their ability to play a game and will excel in something else. The student should realize it is only just a game and they should focus on other things than just that game. When a person goes to college it is based on their grades on an act or an sat as well as their grade point average. There are many reasons why a student athlete needs to excel at his academics. They need to be ready for life after the game. A student should actually try in school instead of just coasting through school with grades that will let him pass for athletics. The teachers are here to teach you and if they don't want to try they shouldn't be allowed to play.,"These photo's that were taken by NASA are rock formations. These photos were taken in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. People thought that the formations were from other living things that are on Mars. Nasa took several pictures of these rock formations because they were shaped like humans. The rock formations starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even ended up in haunted grocery store checkot lines for 25 years. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. After taking several more photographs of these landforms people started to realize that they were natural landforms and not made by other living things. NASA put the photots on JPL web sites so that people could see these pictures up close. Few cientisct thought that these artifacts were made by aliens. When NASA first took a picture of these faces they said that the face was staring back at the camera. They looked like Egyptian Pharaoh's. There was no alien monument after all. The pictures actually show a butte or a mesa landforms comman aroiund the American West. These are natural landforms becuase scientitst say that there is no life on Mars. NASA took pictures in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. If there were objects in the pictures like an airplane on the ground or an Egyptain style pyramid or even a small shak you could see what they were.    ","In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new use of technology called Facial Action Coding System (FACS), tells what emotions your using my theory of the FACS Is that It will work, but It's not telling the truth. My theory Is that they are wasting all their time and money, and the FACS is not telling the truth the reason beaging Is you can never have a computer tell you your own emotions, also "" If It Is some how ture about your emotions than you just got luckey for It to work but that's the only time It will work"". Another reason Is the time and money, who In their right mind would spend all there family time, and most of their hard earnd money on something that wouldn't work. To me I would rather sit at home whrn I'm done working and spend time with my family, and I wouldn't speed a penny on that sofeware that Is not granted to work. Third of all what Is the stictist there Is none In the reading that I read so, judt why not get something up and running and, not put any stictist It Is dumb on their part. In conclusion there Is nobody that Is going to change my mind about this soft wear working If It does then I'll chang my argument about It untill then It's not going to work, and that my opiotion.  ","In the article the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents. Studying Venus is a difficult challenge that NASA is trying to achieve. NASA is trying to create an aircraft that will last long in venus's environment conditions. They have a aircraft that is made out of silicon carbide that will last about 3 weeks. NASA and other scientist believe that venus was once like earth, they believed that there was once water and living oganisms. Due to the planet being so close to the sun, and the sun being as hot as it is the temperature of the planet is average 800 degrees fahrenheit. The planet now has a rocky sediment, valleys, mountians, and craters. Also from the planet being so hot the aircrafts that had been made for venus wouldn't last very long. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experence on our own planet. The aircraft must be strong enought to support itself and not be crushed. ""even a submariene accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans would be crushed and would liquefy many metals. Not only is venus very hot and has a greater atmospheric pressure, the weather and natural diasters are dangerous. Venus often has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface."" Going to venus would be a very diffuicult for scientist to achieve. The aircraft that they built would only last about 3 weeks. The temperature on the planet is average 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atomic pressure is 90 times greater than is is on earth. The Weather on venus is also very dangerous.",,,,,,,
500,220,"I agree with the principal, kids need these extracurricular classes. Because after a long days of work, kids want to have fun and relax. First of all kids are full of energy, and parents want them to get it all out before they come home. Secondly kids can have these extracurricular classes to get rid of their jitters, and have fun at the same time. lastly some kids are less hyper so we can have extracurricular like reading, coloring, photo journalism, etc. In conclusion kids will need these things to calm their nerve or to just chill and do whatever they want . Sometimes kids are given ice cream or sugary drinks and food at school and the kids will get hyper. They need these things to help them work out the sugar in their bodies. Like sports can help by making them run around and making them tired and get rid of the jitters. in conclusion going to do the extracurricular activities or something can get rid of their jitters out of their systems . Some kids parents want them to get their jitters out before coming home, but the kids just sometimes want to wait to play with their parents. So kids can go run around and play with friends play games and stuff at school in the extracurricular activities. If kids do these than when they go home they can go to sleep and not bother their parents. in conclusion kids are crazy when they get home so if they get it out at school than they get rid out their energy they wont annoy their parents . Kids that are calm and quiet are not really active and don't want to do sports. So they can join extracurricular that are calm also like coloring . They can also do reading,yearbooks,and photo journalism or something they like. In conclusion some kids want to do sports and some don't in the extracurricular classes they can do whatever they like . Kids will need to let out their energy or else they will be bouncing off the walls with so much energy. Some kids would like to let that energy out so they go to the extracrrecular classes. Some kids ant to just chill so they go to these classes where they can do both. In condition I agree with the princapal they should put extracurricular classes for those hyper and non hyper kids .","With  the  article  i  have  read  it  tells  me  many  interesting  information  and  facts  also oppinion and  it  also  tells  me  the  mesege  the  writer  is  trying  to  send  me  about  car-free  cities.

In it the author presented both positive and negative aspectes of the driverless cars. After reading the article I am for driverless cars, because they will minimize the amount of accidents on the road and they could allow the ""driver"" of the car to be doing something other than driving the car. In my first reason for saying that I was for driverless cars I said that they would reduce the amout of accidents on the road. I say this because in the article the author talks about how google have had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 and they haven't crashed. This shows how safe the driverless cars are. If these cars were on the road over normal cars they would prevent the driver error accidents, in turn minimizing the amount of accidents. My other reason for being for driverless cars is they would allow the ""driver"" of the car to be doing something other than driving. BMW has been working on this feature of the driverless cars. They use a headsup displays in the car the show a form of entertainment and information systems to entertain the diver. And sence the driverless cars still need some driver assistance the display instantly turns off when the driver is need. This feature is not in a normal car. If the driver was need and they were texting the phone wouldn't turn off, there for making the driverless cars safer. I am for driverless car for the reason of ""drivers"" being able to something other than driving the car and driverless cars could minimize the amount of accidents on the road.      ","Dear Principal, It is outrageous that you think students should have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities! This is wrong because kids need more exercise, they need something to feel proud about, and they want to make friends on teams or clubs. To start off, kids need something to be proud of. They may not be smart or maybe they just don't like their teacher. If they are not that smart, they feel stupid in front of their parents and friends. Being on a sport's team or in a club would make them feel like they accomplished something. For instance, kids may be getting a C average but they are the best actor in the drama club or have the best arm on the football team. Getting bad grades shouldn't make them feel like they don't have a purpose in life but rather signify that their purpose in life is not to be a rocket scientist or a chemical engineer but to use their skills to entertain their family, friends or fans. Next, kids these days need more exercise. Most of them sit around playing sports video games when they can be out playing the real thing! For some kids, the only exercise they get is in gym class or on sports. I'm sure parents would rather have their kid playing linebacker instead of pretending to be one on Brett Favre's team. Also, kids can meet random people playing video games and may want to meet them in the real life. With voice changer technology, people can make their voice sound lower or higher, matching a kids voice. Last of all, kids want to make friends! Their not going to make any real friends watching Spongebob dance around under a rock, they are going to make friends that have the same interests at them, such as a forensics club. If kids sign up for forensics, they will meet other kids that like it too. They go to different schools in the area. They could make friends in all of these schools! They all like forensics and, who knows, maybe they have something else that they all like to do. To conclude, students who have lower than a grade B average (which is many of them) would miss out on that ""proud"" feeling, they would have a hard time making friends, and they wouldn't be getting most of the exercise that should be getting.","If people look at images of Cydonia Mars, they will come to see what looks like a mysterious face. A plethora amount of people belive that this face was made by aliens. Aliens are not real, and if they where we would have come to account with them by this day in age. It is humorous to think that people belive in aliens. These claims are rediculous to even think about if you have common sence. The mysterious face on Mars is just a mesa. It is just something that came to be like how the Grand Canyon was formed. As the cameras get better pictures, the face starts to disappear. The picture was took in 1976 when technology was just now new to us. The conspiracy theory is not true. People claim that then new picture of the face is not a valid source because it was ""cloudy."" These claims are rediculous. We went up into space again to find that it still looked nothing like a face. If this was created by aliens, then that means the pyramids were created by aliens, or Niagara Falls was created by aliens. It is the same as saying the universe was created by aliens. The face is just a natural landform just like any natural landform on Earth. If the face was supposidly created by aliens then you could also say that about any natural landform on Earth. In fact, the new pictures of the face look nothing like a face. People who believe these theories must have a huge imagination. If these aliens are real, how come we havent come to account with them yet. Many people believe that the face was made by aliens. The mysterious face on Mars is was not created by aliens.",In this article about the Facial action Coding System I think that this invention from thomas huang would be super great. For example if someone was feeling down and didnt think the could talk to anyone about it. This would be shown only on percentages which woudnt tell you much but it also coud help. I think it would help many things in our nearing future we could help many more people if they were feeling sadness or deppression. Also it would be good to know how people are feeling without them saying a word to them If you had a bad day at home or something that would be great for people to understand what your feeling and just not bother you. In conclusion I think that it would be a greta idea for them to have a machine that would understand and recongize ur emotions because it could make people's lives alot more simple. This could help a man at his job he didnt sleep well that night his boss looks through the machine and notices that his worker only got ten percent of sleep last night and lay's off,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the authoor suggests that studying Venus is a bad thing to do and is very dangerous. The author gives a few reasons on why it is dangerous. First, Venus is a very hot planet. People would sometimes think the hottest planet is Mercury because it is closer to the sun but it isn't the hottest. In paragraph 3 is explains that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degreea, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. For example, diving to the deepest part of the oceans would liquefy many metals. Second, a long time ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. But today, Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. So maybe a long time ago it would have been nice to visit but now, it isn't. Way to hot and it is covered all in rocks and valleys. Lastly, in paragraph 5 it explains that ""Hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" So even if you wanted to try to go to Venus, you would die of heat. Your vehicle would not make it back.. you wouldn't either. I think the author did good at supporting his idea with many reasons. The author gave many reasons why you shouldn't try to travel to Venus. ",,,,,,,
500,728,"These days, before deeming them worthy of an acceptance letter, colleges take many aspects of a students life, into consideration. Many think colleges only look at grades and test scores, when that is not the case. Although, grades and test scores are crucial to admission, they aren't the only thing colleges look at. Extracurricular activities are a great way to stand out to colleges. Many students shy away from participating in extracurricular activities because they aren't aware of the benefits. Requiring students to participate in them would eliminate future grievances. Leadership skills, passion, and being well-rounded are all things colleges look for in students. Colleges absolutely love having notable alumni; which is why, they look for pupils with many examples of leadership. Schools offer various opportunities to show off those skills. One popular example is sports. What says leadership better than being team captain? Sports are also a common way to receive scholarships. Last year, someone on the Riverside Baseball Team got into Princeton. It is very likely they got in because of their performance on the baseball team. He probably wouldn't have gotten into Princeton if he hadn't played baseball. The Riverside Baseball player is a key example of how extracurricular activities are beneficial to students. If one isn't athletic, sports are not the only option. Being the president, treasurer, or even secretary, of a club are wonderful positions to show leadership. My older sister was the treasurer of Humanity First in her junior year and the president in her senior year; she was accepted into Duke. It is highly likely that if she wasn't president, or treasurer, she wouldn't have been admitted. Leadership skills are vital for college acceptance, and requiring extracurricular activities would help students showcase them. Passionate people are sought out by colleges, and extracurricular activities are a great way to show passion. Passionate people are often very committed. Colleges want active members of society in their schools, not people who sign up for activities to be able to say they were apart of them. Colleges know when someone signs up for a club just because they think it'll look good for college. They want people to sign up for a club because they genuinely enjoy its purpose, and not because of what it'll look like on an application. Colleges want active club members; not club members who barely go to meetings. Participating in marching band for all four years shows commitment, passion, and loyalty. Colleges want those attributes, so they are assured their students won't leave them for another college, and if they decided their major, they will stick with it. Required extracurricular activities would help students find their passions, and they would no longer wander aimlessly in life. Extracurricular activities show colleges passion, and passion is rare among teenagers. Often, passionate people go on to do great things in the world, and colleges want to have notable alumni. Contrary to popular belief, GPA and test scores aren't everything. Sure, they are very helpful and important on transcripts, but there are other factors colleges look at as well. Colleges like well-rounded people. This could be linked to the fact that American colleges allow their students to change their majors. If a person is well-rounded, then it is more likely that if they change their major to something completely different, they will not fail. Being an active member in extracurricular activities shows that the person is not just good at memorizing notes, but that they are also able to partake in deeper thinking. Colleges want people that can use all of their brain, and not just one side of it. If someone had a perfect SAT/ACT score, a 5.0 GPA, and no extracurricular activities, they would probably not be chosen over someone with an SAT score of 1539, a 4.35 GPA and multiple extracurricular activities. Required extracurricular activities would stop the person with a perfect SAT/ACT score and a 5.0 GPA from losing their spot to someone academically inferior who had more extracurricular activities. In terms of roundness, colleges want circles, not triangles. Required extracurricular activities would benefit everyone. Leadership skills, passion, and appearing well rounded would enhance anyone's chances of getting into college and receiving scholarships. Scholarships mean spending less money on college, which helps those who are paying for college. In the end, the principle's decision to require extracurricular activity participation, was a good one.","In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked. All of those miles contributed to global warming by emitting green house gases. Germany, France, and Bogota have realized the effects of driving cars and are taking action. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Since the mid-1990's Bogota has has been celebrating The Day Without Cars. This program had millions of columbians hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to the places they needed to go. Car-free day left the streets free of traffic jams. Once Bogota stated to reduce car usage, they replaced the narrow, uneven sidewalks with smooth, wide ones. Throughout the city new restaurants, shopping districts, and even parks and sports centers have bloomed. About 7 million people participated in Bogota's Car-free Day. A city in Germany called Vauban has given up their cars. Vauban's streets are completely car-free. ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here,"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal. Vauban is a growing trend in Europe and the Unites States. Since there are no cars in Vauban, stores were placed withing walking distance. Paris, France banned driving due to smog. Robert Duffer states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The car banning started on a Monday. Drivers who did not comply were fined 22-euros ($31). Nearly 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded. After five days of intensifying smog, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. However, citizens did complain about the inconvenience so exceptions were made for hybrids and plug-in cars. The smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban. Barack Obama's goals to curb the United Sates' greenhouse gas emission unveiled last week and will make a shift in American behavior. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses. Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Limiting car usage has many advantages. The advantages include less greenhouse gasses, less smog, closer shopping areas, less traffic, and a healthier environment.    ","In the article ""driverless cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverles cars. I am strongly for driverless cars because they let you relax at the wheel by driving. Another reason I am for driverless cars it will allow the roads to be safer. The last reason I am for it is they will allow pedestrians to use public transpertation with out there life in risk. How will a driverless car let you relax at the wheel. A driverless car will let you relax at the wheel during traffic jams up to speeds of 25 mph. The only thing you would have to do during a traffic jam is keep your hands on the wheel. The car will make you keep your hands on the wheel by using sensors. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. Would anybody have ever thought there would be cars that dang near can drive their selves with out hurting anybody. Well the car designers are getting close. There are sensors on on some of these cars that will allow the car to brake instantly if the car is out of controll skids or roll overs. When these cars come out it will allow them to brake before running off the road. Without the option of smarter roads maufactures turned to smarter cars that can steer them selves. World transportation with out worrying about the driver wrecking. There would not be no worrying if there were driverless cars. The google cofounder forsees these public transpertations using have the fuel that we use tody on cars. he beleives such cars would fundamentally change the world. So one day we will not have to risk are lives riding public transpertation if there is no driver. In this article they have shown you why driverless cars are more safer and I have gave you my point of veiw in this essay so whats yours?                                                                                                                                                                   ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think your plan to change the school's policy is just fine. I love the idea of you making the student body work hard for something they want. Not everything should be handed to them. If they wish to represent our school they should keep their grades high enough. We wouldn't want someone who can't keep their grades decent to represent our great school. Even though most students in the athletic department have a grade C averages, we should make our students work hard enough to make it to where they want to be in life. If the students don't work hard enough, how will they know to work for something they want? If we hand them everything they won't learn a life lesson they need. They can't keep thinking that everything will be handed to them when they please. If they have a grade C average, they will know that its not good enough to represent this school. That will tell them that they need to work harder. Not only will them making higher grades will benefit them but our school, too. This action you could take will put our school in a higher category than most other schools in Texas. This will make our school as a whole, a better place. This could keep our grades a place where other schools wish they had them. In conclusion, I hope you come through with this decision. This will benefit us in many ways. This could make our student body care more about what they're doing. It makes them want something even more. It will also teach them a good lesson, always work hard to get something in return. If they work hard in school, they will be rewarded with an out of school activity.","Mars, the Red Planet, has been thought to have lifeforms living on it for many years now, by many people. Yet there is no comfirmed evidence that there is life on Mars, or that there was life on Mars. The ""face"" located in Cydonia, is not a face of anything at all. It is only a mesa. That was naturaly occuring. If there was any life near the ""face"" on Mars, then the Mars Global Surveyor would have found something. I know what you are thinking. That NASA is hiding the fact that there are lifeforms or where lifeforms on Mars. If there were, then NASA would have told the world by know. It would help NASA if there was life out there in space. The picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took in 1976, was to low of a resolution to be seen clearly. In 1998 when another Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia the crew snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the origional Viking 1 photos. Revealing that the so called monument was a natural occuring landform. Yet many people like yourself, where not satisfied by this conclusion and thought that NASA was covering up the fact that there is or was alien life on Mars. NASA then prepared another mission to capture another image of the ""face"". NASA planed this mission for a cloudless sunny day in Cydonia in 2001, so they could get the clearest picture possible. NASA would not risk more money and lives if they already knew that there was life on Mars. It makes no sense. The team that went to capture another photograph, captured one that was the maximum resolution. It would have captured anything that looked out of the ordinary. Including lifeforms and anything they may have left behind. All of the facts point towards the face being a natural landform and not made by anything but nature. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a mesa which are comonly found in the American West. One photograph showed what looked like a face. The other two photos, which were taken with better cameras at a higher resolution, show a mesa. The facts are showing that the ""face"" is not a face at all it is a naturaly occuring land form. If there was any signs of life, past or present. The Mars Global Surveyor would have found something in 2001. All of the facts point to having no lifeforms build this stucture on Mars. If there was any thing out of the ordinary with this mesa then it possibly could have been built by extraterrestrial life. But there was and is nothing out of the ordinary with the mesa. It is the same type of landform that occurs in the Western part of the United States of America. NASA would not cover up alien life if it was benifical. It is like you burning your money. It helps no one. There is no life on Mars and the ""face"" that you saw in 1976 is not a ""face"" made by lifeforms. It is a naturaly occuring landform.","Have you ever spent hours sitting in front of a computer doing school work, learning from a computer-animated face, or simply browsing the web? Have you become bored and uninterested in the process? Professor Thomas Haung has created a computer software that can detect emotions. FACS, the Facial Action Coding System, can be useful reading students' emotional expressions in many ways. A few examples include adjusting a lesson the student is learning if the software detects that they are confused or bored, making computer-animated faces more expressive, and relying on the fact that most human communications are nonverbal, including emotional communication. If a student is spending hours on a computer, whether it be doing homework, studying, or simply learning a new lesson in school, it is likely that they will become bored or confused in the midst of their work. If the FACS were to be installed onto their computer, the software would be able to detect the students' change in expression and emotion, and modify the lesson, homework, or stuyding that the student is doing. This would simulate an effective human instructor. It would also help the student get their work done quicker, and they will become interested in what they are doing again. FACS would greatly lend a hand in the making of computer-animated faces more expressive. This software could help show more emotions among computer-animated faces, such as disgust, sadness, fear, jealousy, etc. By showing more expressive emotions, the FACS would largely help students become more interested in what they are learning, if they are learning from a computer-generated person. If the person hardly shows emotions and is not very expressive, the student will likely become bored and uninterested in what they are doing. However, FACS can help prevent that. An important way FACS can be of use is simply detecting human emotion. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Because computers, and technology in general, are the future, it is vital that computers can understand that. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. However, if you frown when a Web ad appears, the next ad will be different. This will generally make the users experience on the computer more content, as they are not bothered by annoying ads. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System could greatly be useful in many ways. Students can become more interested in learning, studying, or doing homework, computer-animated faces can become more expressive, and most human communication is nonverbal, making it vital that computers can understand that. ","Venus is the second planet form our sun, while Venus is simple to see from the distant vantage point we have here at Earth, it has been difficult place to examine closely. Venus is oftern referred as Earths ""twin"" and is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size this is why we should research Venus as a planet more. Venus is also relatively close to us so we should definetly invest more money researching even though there are some problems. The athor states that Venus has proven many times before that it is not an easy planet to study. Each mission to land on venus was unmanned and for good reason, no aircraft would last more than a few hours. This explains why not a spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Many things contribute to Venus's reputaion as a challenging planet for us humans to study. Some of these things are a thick atmosphere of 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers the Venus, even more challenging are the clouds of extremely corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and on the planets sufare the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 tines greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more intense than anything humans can find on earth. An enviroment like venus's Would crush a submarine accustomed to driving in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy minerals. All these things plus more is why every mission so far has been unmanned, and why there hasnt been a singe spaceship that has landed in Venus in almost 3 decades. Despite all of the potentially dangerous things about Venus there is still alot to benefit. NASA or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an compelling idea for sending humans to study the cloudy planet. NASA's possible solution to the hostile condtions on the surface would allow scientists ti float above the fray and study without harm. It's a blimp like vehicle that hovers 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian. Hovering over venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. The author says ""Maybe we should think of them as challenges."" By the end of the article the author says ""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only becasue of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""",,,,,,,
500,825,"Imagine being in a situation in which you where being forced by a superior to partake in an activity in which you disapproved of. I certainly would not be fond of the idea. I disagree with the principals' decision to force kids to partake in extracurricular activities. I believe that this idea would be a problem because it cuts deep into kids social time, it would negatively affect their attitudes as it is forced activity, and it could be a great loss of time for some of them. I believe that forcing kids to partake in extracurricular activities would be a great mistake for it cuts on kids social time. The principal should recognize that kids usually socialize after school and placing all of them in extracurricular activities would limit their interactions. Kids need social time as it is one of the basic needs of humanity and life without it would be grey and dull. I remember when I was around seven years old when we went on a vacation to Japan. It was a wonderful place, but I remember that since I could not speak Japanese I rarely talked to anybody besides my family and the people that knew English. I remember coming back and getting new energy from talking to people as I had not been social for some time. Every time I look back, this moment always makes me remember that social interaction is a key component in the human life. I disagree with this notion of forced extra activities, I believe that forcing kids to partake in extracurricular activities would end up in very disinterested and angry students. We all know that a person who wants to learn will do better in a activity than a person who was forced to. We will see that mixing interested kids who want to be there an uninterested ones will do more harm than good. I believe that kids should come to these extra activities voluntarily and not be forced to attend. I also believe that forced extracurricular activities would be bad to teachers as more clubs would have to me made and in result it forces teachers to work extra hours. This would cause disinterested and angry teachers which would further affect students and cause problems. I believe that these forced extracurricular activities would be a waste of time for some of these students and cause them to miss other things that could have been on their schedule for that day. For example, they could have had a family/religious event that they would have to miss because of these extra activities. They could also be doing outside of school sports that they would have to skip because of these activities. In cases such as these extracurricular activities could be a major problem and could cause a very disheartened student. In all I disagree with the principal that all students should be forced to commit to extracurricular activities for I believe that it would be bad for them socially, that it could affect their work ethic, and could cause major schedule problems. While I believe that these activities may help some students they do not help all and no one should be forced to commit to them.","Fellow citizens there are many advantages to limitng car use. One big advantage is a reduce in global warming. Auto-moblie causes a large percent of greenhouse gas emissions as stated in source 1, paragraph 5. Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than half. Car pollution can also can aslo cause smog which aslo took a toll on Paris , who had to ban driving do to smog .Due to the smog delivery companies lost revenue and public transit was free of charge for a couple of days. Smog can also travel easily to other cities throughout the air. Also car usage has taken a toll on previous bills in the united states as stted in source 1 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only the other 20 percent to other transport. Limitng car usage can greatly reduce the number of traffic jams throughout cities. As staed in souce 4. During Bogata car-free day parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. There has been 118 miles of bicycle paths , which means more exercise which is good for your health.    ","I don't think driverless cars are really that important. It's interesting, and would be cool but not important. I believe a lot of people would buy them. The purpose of driving is supposed to be exciting for you, instead they're driving for you. All together they're not important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting. Driverless cars are not important, I believe that just driving regularly is better that the car doing it for you. There are still cars that people could drive just fine. I don't see why people would want their car to drive for them. Driverless cars could cause accidents. I think if a careless teen would be driving it, they could think that car would be doing all the work. They would think that they don't need to focus. There are already problems with texting a driving, imagine if they thought they could text because the car is doing all the work. In the article it says that the car needs you to be alert at all times incase they come across work zones. I think that could cause accidents. I believe that many people are careless drivers. People could get used to the idea of the car taking care of everything, in the article it says that the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Which could cause people to do things they could never do if they had to pay attention at all times. Someone could be paying attention to other things in the car instead of steering and cause an accident. The thought of driverless cars is very interesting, I would be more accepting of them if I knew they were safe, and no one would get hurt. Someone who's been driving for a long time, I think would be more interested in it. New drivers who aren't used to driving would probably want to drive by themselves. I think the driverless car could be very useful to people who take trips that are far, and need to relax. Overall, I think the driverless car isn't important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting. I personally wouldn't want one, but others might be very interested. It could cause accidents to happen, especially if the driver is careless. It is an interesting invention though, the idea of having a car drive for you is cool. But I don't think it's worth the risk.    ","Having sports in school is more of a activity and something most students would like to participate in. Sports should not be your first priority though, your grades should be. Having the choice to do sports in school is a gift. And if you would want to do sports you should have certain requirements. If you would like to play in sports in school then you should get good grades, such as an average with B' s and above. But if you bring your grades down to a C then maybe you can get some extra practice or credit to raise it up. Having a C isn't bad, but if you would like to play sports then your requirements and goal should be higher then others. When you are on a tem at school people look at you as a ro -model ands a more of a leader. If you have bad grades think they are going to think that it is easy to have bad grades. You should set goals if you want to play sports and they should be to get better and to be the best that you can be, and to get good grades and to be a good student. If you get in trouble at school then you should be off of the team, but with the circumstances your coach could decide on what to do to you. When you are on a schools team you are doing an activity and which activities come after school, and if you grades go behind then you shouldn't be allowed to do school sports. Reasonings why i support that is because if your not a kid who gets good grades then your going to fall behind and then loose lack of education. Therefore those are my reasons why i think that if you want to play in school sports then you have to get good grades such as b' s and above.","The face on mars could not be an alien monument. You may argue that it was made by an ancient civilization, how would they know we had a lower resolution camera on the orbiting to make it in a way that the shadows would produce a face. Even on a cloudy day, the high resolution images of the martian mesa did not look like a face any more. The details showen proves the fact that it is a natural land form simular to the ones ones on earth. Jim Garvin stated,""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Useing his rule of thumb, the higher resolution shows more details of the face. So if there is aliens, how come we dont even see evidence of buildings around them? If it was built, a monument like that would have take time to build. In turn liveing accomadations would be needed for the workers and the pictures show none. Although you may beleve that there is life on mars, please acumulate more proof before saying that it is a fact. This universe is big and yes it is possible because the universe is so big but there is no proof that there is life on mars. I hope this would sway your thoughts. ","In this artical it show that a computer can testg your real emotions. ""For instance you probably tell when yuor friend is feeling happy or sab by there discripstion on there face"". You can clearly see if you happy or sad by how you cheak bones on there face. It is a good part of technology that it constucts a 3-D computer modl of your own face. So when you are taking a test or a quize on the computer the computer can seee your expresion. And when yor teacher passes by they can see the computer and they can see your face. It cna show happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear and sadness when your on the computer. They can also see whne your ae board. we use the same emotions every single day and we might not even now it. You might give you best friend a gift and there emotions are going to change as when they are looking at the present. It could be very good and there going to be happy or its going to be bad and your going to have a sad emotions. And wile you get the gift your friend can see your emotions and how you react to it. So I think its a good divice to poot emotions on the computer and see how the emotions change overtime wile they are on the computer. As I said before your teachere can be walking by and see how your emotions change over the time you are taking a test or your taking a quize. So I think its a good product on the computer to test your emotions.","The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker. Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth. I think the autors statement on this is that when the temperature drops its very hard to communitcate with people going up there, but when it cools down its better for them. The Earth and Beyond it should not be limited by dangers and douts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. There devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s an playedan important role in the 1940's during World War ll. The thoughts of computers in those days did caulations for them, which in today's years we know thing about. Many of the reserchers of the NASA is working on other approches to studying Venis. Like some are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditiond. There a lot of projects that there looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Using mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. ",,,,,,,
293,104,"Even though different technology can do many things, reading emotional expressions using technology can be valuable. It is valuable because this kind of technology can seek if your happy, sad, excited, surprised, etc. Many people don't express their emotions the same way. This technology we're talking about is called the Facial Acting Coding System and it enables humans emotions. This technology is however valuable because it can clarify how others are feeling even if they're hiding their emotions. It can also let someone know which emotion your showing because sometimes diiferent emotions can be showed with the same facial expression. When showing expressions, many of your muscles are being used. Computers can recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel by constructing 3-D computer model of the face and the 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" When you show any type of facial expression, your using at least one or more muscles. This is called action ","Driving while on your cellphone is a safety hazard. You should never be on your cell phone while driving because it is dangerous. Many people die every day due to being on their cell phones while driving. Texting and driving is a big distraction that causes many deaths. If you are operating a vehicle, your attention should always be on the road. Although many teens are getting blamed for texting and driving, many adults do it too. Texting and driving has caused many deaths over the last couple of years in the U.S. Most of today's car crashes are due to texting and driving. It's very important to not text and drive. To begin, it's very dangerous and can cause a lot of problems, including accidents. However, texting and driving is not the only thing that causes accidents. If you're talking on the phone while driving, that can be a big problem as well. When talking on the phone, you can get distracted easily. Driver's need to focus on driving and not be distracted by phones or any other electronic devices. Another reason you should not operate a phone while driving is because you may harm yourself or others. Small children could be in the car and drivers should be aware of such precious cargo. Children are most vulnerable when it comes to car crashes. That's why it's very important to be mindful about texting and driving. Young kids die every day because of careless drivers. In closure, the main reason why you shouldn't text and drive is because other people's lives are at stake. Many people don't understand how dangerous using an electronic device while operating a vehicle can be. Texting and driving can be harmful and fatal. If more people learn how to wait until they get to their destination, then more lives would be saved. Help prevent texting and driving by focusing on the road. The lives of others aren't worth losing over a text.         ","Advice Imagine you're stuck on a problem, and you have no idea how to fix it. You've tried to think of several solutions, but none seem to come to mind. Going to people you trust for advice is one of the best ways to help you in any situation. When asking for advice, it's best to go to more then one person and seek multiple opinions, because with many opinions, you get more solutions, point of views, and support to help you make the better choice. The more opinions you get, the more thought out solution you can make for a choice best fit for you. When you're in a problem, there are many ways to get out of it. Having many people say their opinion gives you many solutions to any given situation. Some people might give you the easiest way, while others might give you a more thorough way to get out of a problem. For example, when I'm in an argument with a friend, I like to go to people I trust and ask them the best way to handle the argument. Some may say to drop the friend and move on with my life, while others might give me ways to talk to my friend and fix the issue. In that moment I have many ways to help my problem, and I can choose which way to follow based on what I believe to be the best for me and my friend. When asking for many people's opinion on a situation, it gives you different ways to act upon the issue, which helps you solve the conflict in the best way possible. When you have a problem, your point of view is the only one you can truly know about. With other people there to help you solve an issue, they give you what they see on the situation so you have a better understanding of the problem. Different points of view give you the idea of where a misunderstanding may have occurred, or what you need to work on for future references. For example, when I become frustrated with a friend, other people's points of view could show me where I might have misunderstood what my friend was trying to say. With that information, I can solve the conflict with my friend and know what I could work on when communicating with people so the problem doesn't occur again. Points of view are big factors in an issue, so with many people's opinions, it helps you solve a conflict while taking other people's understanding of a problem into consideration. While you are going through a major issue, you feel alone sometimes. Asking people for their opinions can also help provide you support to make you feel less lonely in a problem. Not only are people good for advice, but they are also good for knowing someone has your back no matter what's going on. If I am in a hard situation, I always go to people who I know care about me because I know they will always support my decisions that are best for me. Having a person there who you can trust always helps you know when you are making the best choice for yourself because they know you and can give advice that they believe will help you succeed. People often find themselves in difficult situations, and going to many people for their opinion is often one of the best ways to solve a problem. With more the one person giving you a opinion, it gives a you many different ways to solve the conflict so you can pick a solution that will leave the best possible outcome for yourself. Different people have different views on situations, so with someone else's point of view, you're able to view an outside perspective of your issue and find a solution that can benefit everyone involved in the problem. When going through a conflict, you may feel alone, and asking for a friend or partner's support is a super beneficial way to get through a tough time. Ultimately, asking for advice is one of the most effective way to help you and others when solving a problem, and it can help guarantee that you're making a better choice.","Driving around could be fun espicaly when your young bu thva eyou ever thought about how much easier life could be without a car? There could be many advantages by limiting car usage, for example you'll save lots of money; easier to get around and you can get around faster; lastly its alot safer. Sure driving around could be fun but dont forget to think about the advanges of saying goodbye to that car. To begin, buying a car can be very expensive with the car payments and the down payment and espically the gas money. Buying a bike compared to buying a car is way less expensive. You pay a couple hundred for a bike and you have it for as long as you want because its yours but when u buy a car you pay thousands of dollars for it and it only last a couple years. Gas money these days is insane. Paying $4 for a gallon of gas when ou have a 20 gallon tank can get very very expensive so why waste the money, buy a bike or even just walk and youll never have to pay for gas again. Some people dont really like the idea of bikin everywhere but thats not the only option. Walking, scootering, rollerskating, skateboarding and biking are all other options instead of taking a car. If ou wanna be smart and save money then i suggest getting rid of that car and getting yourself a bike! Secondly, safety can be a big issue espically with how people drive now a days. There are more teenagers on the road and more drunk drivers too! Not all people who get behind the wheel can be trusted driving next to you. Some people may think that just because they have their license means they can have a couple a drinks and are still able to get behind the wheel and drive safely. Thousands of people every year die from car accidents, if you dont wanna be one of those people then get rid of your car and be safe. Lastly, sitting at a stop light for 5 minutes can feel like your sitting there forever. That problem has an easy soultion though, GET RID OF YOUR CAR! Getting rid of your car means no more stop lights or stop signs or people cutting you off and making you wait for them. Im sur you think that a car is the fastest way to get around but it really isnt. biking or walking or running or anyway besides a car is another fast way to gt around. ou might not be able to walk as fast as a car can drive but when walking you dont have to wait for a stop light to turn green you can just keep walking plus its good excersise. To conclude , driving always seems like the easiest choice but is it the safest, least expensive, or the fastest? No, no its not. Bike riding, walking, roller skating, skate boarding, even riding a scooter, and running are all alternative ways for you to get aorund without using our car. Save money, be safe and get there faster by getting rid of your car!    ","My alarm goes off, I check the time it is 6:45, time to start getting ready for school. I am extra excited for school today because it is the first time I have had a class with my best friend in a while. I check my phone to assure that she is going to be there and than I am off to school. Although some may believe otherwise, students benefit better from being in an actual classroom, because they get to have real life relations with other students and do not have as many distractions than if they were at home. Part of growing up is learning how to interact with different people, many kids do this through going to school and making relations with other students. Going into my freshman year of high school I was the ""New Student"", I had just moved about 45 minutes from where I had grown up. Coming into Generic_School I did not have many friends, however I knew this had to change. That same year I joined the Cross Country team and made several friends throughout the season, some of which were even in my classes. More specifically I met my best friend, Generic_Name, she introduced me to many of my friends now, and I would not have had as many relations if it was not for her. As well as doing myself a favor in becoming more involved with the school. A baby crying, the oven making noises, and the T.V raging in the background are just a few examples of distractions students face at home on a daily basis. In school, teachers and staff work several days a week to limit the amount of distractions there are to students. A new rule that was implemented at my school was the ""Cellphone Holder"", before class students are required to put there phone in the assigned number of the holder. Cellphones are a huge distractment at school, many teens are addicted to their phones and when the phone is left with them they feel the need to check it at least once every 2 minutes. If cellphones are a problem at school, imagine how much more of a distraction they are at home. While some may say that the benefit of online school is protecting students against bullying, this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is more likely going to increase the chances of cyberbullying. When I was in middle school I broke my arm playing Volleyball, I was unable to attend school for a week. I was given assignments through blackboard and some of my friends. However, two days after my surgery I went to check my Instagram and I saw that several people had commented on my most recent post. Unfortunately they were not the nicest comments, they were comments like ""Too bad you didn't break your other arm too"" and ""It's not like you need your arm"". I was victim of cyberbullying and I did not want to acknowledge that, not being in school for a week was one of the worst times of my life. To conclude it is more beneficial for students to go to school rather than participate in online school because it teaches students the benefits of making relations with other students and prevents the distractions students face at home. With the talk of Covid 19 there are a lot of speculations that some schools could switch to online schooling, while it might benefit saving people from the disease, it still takes away from many kids learning. In addition, it takes away the food and support some students rely on from the school. Going to school plays a huge role in students lives, and it would be a shame for it to be taken away. ","Have you wanted a to hit a soccer ball and make a goal or win a debate tournament at your school. Students who want to try-out sports or debate find an extracurricular at their school. Having at least a extracurricular is a good idea to have when you are looking for something new at your school or club. Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends. Having a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active. An extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able. Socializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular. Another, way you can socialize with your friends is making new friends in extracurricular. You to meet other people that might want to be friends with. I have friends and made friends in a book club while talking about the book and relevant topics. Having at least one extracurricular is a great to keep students active on the activity, finding different extracurricular's and socializing with your friends and making new ones. Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into. So what I think about students participating in a extracurricular in school is that students should have an opportunity to have at least one extracurricular. ","Self driving cars. Everybody wants a car that can drive itself, but is it really practical? Many people say that self driving cars are a thing of the future, while others argue that they should not exist. Autonomous cars are not practical and should not be on the road because they are dangerous, impractical, and boringly monotonous. Self driving cars are dangerous because they will not be able to sense or detect danger as wells as humans could. ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Cars are not safe under the care of automized vehicles due to the fact that there are too many variables and sporadic possibliltys when driving. Now other than dangerous, they are also very impractical. Early forms of self driving cars such as ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" are examples of how impractical they are. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,"" this is a very slow speed and seems almost useless. Along with only going 25 mph self driving cars also require you to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"". To add on to driverless cars being impractical, automated cars would make road trips very boring and dull. ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,"" admits Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW Project manager driver."" Taking road trips would be the only thing that comes mind when thinking of why you would need a driverless car, and then even road trips would become very repetitive and bland. ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" this shows that autonomous cars would take the fun out of taking road trips. All in all, Autonomous cars are not the next big thing and are potentially a huge safety hazard. Driver assistance may be something that could be useful to drivers with impairments but driverless cars is taking it to the next level. Without roads to pair with these cars the use of driverless cars is impractical and not down to earth. So go out there and show your car some appreciation and give it a test drive, completely un-automated.",,,,,,,
293,220,"Everybody shows emotion every day, they are apart of the human nature. Dr. Huang and his partner have high knowledge adn are highly educated at making improved ways for humans and computers to communicate. Dr. Huang and his partner made a computer, Facial Action Coding System, that can so called ""calculate"" eamotions. This computer could be valuable to read expressions of students in classrooms. People would say that when they are or were in school that they were had some type of emotion about the lesson that htey were going to learn. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confude or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts"" (paragraph 6). This computer could help the students learn and teachers could help the students better if they are unexcited, bored, or even confused. When a teach knows that a student(s) are bored or confused with a lesson they try to change it to where the students won't be. ""'Then it [the computer] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (paragraph 6). With the Facial Action Coding System the teacher would really have to do much and figure out how to change the whole lesson but still have the same content and have it in the same time length as planned. To help students understand in the classroom the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable by reading the students expressions. Citizens who go or went to school would agree that this computer could help and even Dr. Huang said that it could help students. It could also help teachers by not taking up there time so they could get other stuff done, like grading paper and looking at other lessons.","Phone & Driving It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after. Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving. Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone. Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone. To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                  ","Generic_Name March 13, 2020 English SOL Generic_School #2 block Do you need help when it comes too challenging sitituions and problems? Things aren't that easy in the world when sititutions you just don't know what to do, seeking or asking for someone advice is very help in a way. For example picking an new outfit for school you like two choices but don't know which one to pick because the two outfits are both cute so you ask one of your family members or ask a friends for their opinions on which outfit is the best looking. There are problems in life where you just don't know what direction to go in. Asking a good amount of people for their advice or their options are good so you can see an other person point of view or perspective of what they seem is good or bad for the sitituions. Like looking for a car isn't that easy there are so many brands,colors and other feature on a car you might like and it might be more than one you like but just don't know what to choice. Advice can be and good, helpful thing or bad, hurting thing some people are gonna give you good advice that can help you in a way and some people are gonna give you horrible advice that can hurt you in a way, say you are dealing with a sitituion with your boyfriend or girlfriend some people advice is gonna be that y'all should talk and work the problems out well on the other hand someone is gonna tell you that you don't need him or her or that person should apologize first when you were wrong and you might listen. It depends are what kind of sititution a person is in on what type of advice too give that person. However ther people advice might not sastifed you or help you so something you just might have to go with your own advice and opinions.             ","I think  free car cities would have ups and downs. its downs would be not having quick transportation and waiting for public transportation. its ups would be saving money on gas andglobal warming would start to decrease. if this does happen i would like it very much. In todays world car companys are starting to build eletric cars to eventually to stop making cars that run on gas to be eco friendly. also not having  cars would not be to intellgent because how would over 5,000 to 7,000 people get to work everyday by bus or taxi or train it would be a nightmare. After all that they all have to take the same bus home. It would be absoulte caios in the city nobody would no what to do with out cars. The good part of not have cars is that people would get tko save money becuase there not speanding it on gas. Also the the traffic would go down beause theres no cars on the road. Personally i dont think car free citites would work like people think it would everybody woul have to ride in public transportation and that would be like a war because everybody would be fighting for seats. it might work for the first two weeks but after that it would be awful. The bad part about have no ars is finding ways to get from point A to point B because everybody would be using transportation and the other half of people would be walking. so the buses would be crowded and the sidewalks would be very busy.  I think cars should be in all cities, but there cars should be eletric not running on gas. after that the car companys should make eletric buses so everything would be eco friendly. Finally after my opinion on car free cities i came to conclusion that i didnt agree with this topic beacuse with out cars people would be crowding the streets and it would be hard to get round by walking becuase the streets would be packed. Since my opinon is strong my argument would win and pople would agree that car free cities would not work like people think it would.    ","Most schools have always been about students being in their classrooms physically. It has always been about being around some classmates you probably don't like, having to rush to a class on time so you're not late, or just listening to a teacher's lecture of a specific subject for an hour and some change. Why go through all that nonsense when you can just take your classes at the comfort of your own home? I think that students would benefit from attending classes from home because it would be more comfortable for them and it would decrease the risk of fights. One way attending classes from home would benefit is that it would simply be more comfortable and relaxing for students. You wouldn't have to get dressed for school, you could just stay in bed with your pajamas while attending class, who wouldn't want that? It would be a lot more easier to get to your classes because nobody would be standing in your way. To make it even better, you don't even have to eat school lunch at a specific time, because you could eat whatever you want at any time, so you wouldn't have to worry about getting yelled at by your teacher in class over a bag of chips. For example, there has been an increase of online/video classes due to the coronavirus, so that students don't get sick. While they may move back to going back to school physically once the virus is over, it must be amazing for students who are just sitting in their bedroom while learning. Not only would this be more comfortable, it would also decrease the risk of getting sick. This shows how beneficial attending classes from home would be. Another way attending classes from home could benefit is that it would decrease the risks of fights from happening. You may have heard of the saying ""More People, More Problems"", because that can apply to most schools. The more students you have, the more fights that could possibly happen. People like to start drama with each other, and can easily get upset over the smallest thing. To make it even worse, kids will try to record the fight and post it on social media, giving the school a bad representation of what it is. It's just a mess to deal with, but online classes can easily prevent that. Since everybody would be at home learning, it would be nearly impossible for students to get into a fight. They would be focused more on the online class they're doing, rather than what the other person is saying about them. I'm not saying that no fights will ever happen if we had classes from home, but they would be handling their business outside of school, so if they fight each other, they wouldn't face a consequence because they fought outside of the school campus. This shows how conflict between students could easily get solved with just taking your classes at home. Some people think that attending class from home would be a bad idea because students could easily slack off by doing other things on the internet like watching Youtube. These people are wrong because the school would have most of these sites blocked on their school laptops, so it wouldn't even be possible for students to goof off on their laptops. Even if they do slack off, it's their fault for not taking their classes seriously. This shows that students could be capable of taking online classes, it just falls on them if they want to take it seriously or not. It would be more comfortable and decrease the risk of fights if students benefited taking their classes from home. I feel that this could be beneficial for any school if they did it. If you're a principal reading this, maybe you should consider my two reasons as to why taking classes from home would be a great idea.","Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they could make life long friends that have the same interest. For an example, if you join a club or sport and know nothing about it, you could ask someone in that club or sport to explain and help you understand more about it. After that, you just might have a new friend. Students could join a extracurricular activity because they need a hobby. Students who don't have any activities to do after-school should sign up for a sport or club because they could become really interested in it and keep doing that activity throughout the school year. Students should join extracurricular activities because they could be fun and it could be a new experience. Students could join a extracurricular activity to make new friends. If you have a small friend group and want to expand, joining a club and/or sport would be a good option because there's always teamwork involved. Students could make friends just by having the same interest in a activity, subject, hobby, etc. In conclusion I think joining a extracurricular activity is a good idea for students because they could make new friends and find a new hobby they like.","Cars that drive themselves seem very fututistic, but we are very close to successfully making a car like this. There are many obvious benefits to manufacturing cars like this. I think the most important benefit is in our enviroment. Some other benefits are that we won't have as many deathly car crashes and we would still be able to take control of the vehicle if needed. We shouldn't be scared to make this change that could potentialy change our future for the better. Our enviroment has severely suffered from the massive carbon footprint that our generations have left. A big issue we have is that our air is very polluted. A big factor in this is that billions of people use cars all over the world. This self driving car would use half of the fuel that our cars today use. This could greatly decrease our pollution in big cities all over the world. Car crashes are one of the biggest contributors to our death rate. There are many innocent people who die every day due to other people not paying attention to the road. Google has a car that is somewhat driverless and hasn't crashed once even though they have driven half a million miles. The technology that would be used in these cars would be smart enough to drive safely and alert the person in the vehicle when human assistance is needed. We have the ability to save many men, women, and children by allowing the self driven cars to transport us. Many skeptical people think that giving up control could lead to accidents. When the car senses that there is danger ahead, they alert the person that they need to take over. If someone notices something the car doesn't, they can just put their hands on the wheel. People could still drive their cars if they felt necessary. We wouldn't be fully giving up control if we can just take it right back. Now you see that there are many benefits to making self driven cars. The possibility of some minor negative things that can be fixed, doesn't compare to the positive results we can gaurentee this vehicle might bring. The enviroment will be much better and we will have healthier air to breathe, because we will use less fuel. Our death rates will go down and we can save our future generations with these safe cars. Finally, if anything does happen, we can take back the control of the car at any second. The people of this world will thank us for bringing this self driven car to the streets.          ",,,,,,,
293,728,"If you were a teacher trying to teach a class with over 20 people with different emotions, how efficent would it be to know how all of them feeling? You can do that with FACS (Facial Action Coding System), created by Dr. Pail Eckman. This system classifys 6 basic emotions. It can sense happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is good for teacher who dont understand how their student are feeling about the assignment they assigned. Dr. Huang, says in paragraph four, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" He says, "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Using video imagery, the emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements on a real face or even a picture. The author uses an example of the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. They used the emotion-recongnition on the painting and it showed how Mona Lisa was feeling. It not only looks at how your smiling or how your eye are placed, it also looks at the structure of ur face and how your muscles move. This creation can help lots of teacher all around the world understand and help students learn more efficently. Every single student learns differently and using this system will help teacher use their teaching time wisely. When student dont understand somthing this system can scan your face and tell the teacher what needs to be fixed to help the student understand and enjoy what they are learning. Instead of teachers trying to help one student at a time they can help multiple students at once. You can also use FACS not only in school but other places too. You can use it in work and also in everyday life if you wanted too. In paragrah nine the author talks about a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky. He had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Just making different faces can revel a lot about the science of emotion. FACS is the next big thing. Science has gone to a whole new level in helping our society. Using this system can help all kinds of people in different ways. I think this can help our world grow and learn new things. ","Driving While Using Cell Phone Even though cell phones where not around for a long time it has been a key factor in us daily life to which it as reaches a point where people are now using cell phone even while driving. People use their cell phone for a lot of reason and important things, things such as calling, texting, emailing and more, these activities while driving increases the driver's risk of causing an accident. doing this not only put the driver at risk but also people and other drivers around in that area. Despite the danger that cell phone causes some people argued that it is necessary to use cell phone for emergency reason. However, there are proof to show that cell phone should not be use while operating a motor vehicle. Texting is a very serious issue and people should take it very seriously. we become so interested in what we are doing on the phone and forget that were still on the road driving while on your phone increase the chance 25 times more likely to cause a crash these bad decision that we made while driving always end up in death are serious injuries. Not paying attention, and the hazards we face while driving is something we learn to avoid before getting our driver license. knowing the dangers, it might cost people still use cell phone while driving. People who work depend on cell phone like businessman, lawyers, etc. says that they all ways need to be accessible to their phone in order to keep business going and to secure client. Because of this selfishness, they put other people life's in danger. Research on google shows using of cell phone while driving is responsible for more deaths on the road. in these days we all are multitasking and it is difficult to put the phone down especially if you're on the road for a long period of time. However, it does not worth the cost of your life are someone else's. Thousands of people die every year in transportation that resolve from cell phone use according to the national highway traffic safety security agency. 81 present of us resident admit to using cell phone while driving on the road. Driving while on your phone is dangerous because it causes distraction and crashes. it required three main types of distraction such as, visual, manual, and cognitive. 'Visual' distraction is the most common distraction, this is when drivers focus and eyes are taking off the road. this is when a person now starts to pay attention on their phone and not on the road while driving. the second distraction is 'manual', this is when driers take both hands off the wheel for reason like adjusting their GPS eating and drinking etc. the third distraction is 'cognitive', this is when drivers mind isn't focusing on driving this could be cause by talking to another person while driving, are having family issues etc. drivers should consider the consequence of driver and being on their phone and make better choices for their self and others. If people don't stop using phones on the road the number of accidents will only increase more. It is Drivers responsibly to put their phone on silent and put it away out hands reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ","Have you ever made a bad choice in life, because I know I have. Think about the more sophisticated choices you could have made if only you would have asked more people their opinions on the decision or choice you were about to make. There have been countless times where I have asked myself, did I just make the best choice I could have made? Whether it's a decision you make in sports about what could be the right move to make on this next play, or a choice you have to make at home or in school, it is always good to have plenty of opinions that can help you make the best choice. Your teammates in sports can help you make the best choice. I don't know how many times I can count where I have been playing baseball and we had a team huddle. These usually happen so you can go over your next big play. Since there is a team that have your backs no matter what, I am for sure that I am one-hundred percent comfortable making this next play. Some could also relate this to making an important life choice. Do I take this fantastic job offer? Should we move out of the state we already live in? Do I take enough time in the day to do my homework? There are countless questions as to why you should ask people around you if you are making the best choice. But asking people around you, who have probably been right where you are before, could lead to the best outcome for you. Bad choices lead to consequences. Over fifty-four percent of people in the United States believe that the bad choices they have made can lead to consequences later on. I wonder how many of those same people have asked any of their friends and family if the choice they make right now would turn on them, or benefit them later on. Whenever I have a big decision to make I go to my friends, family, coaches, and teachers. No questions asked. It is so good to have multiple peoples opinions on these types of things. There was a time when I had to choose whether to go on a better baseball team that had some of my friends on it, or a not as good baseball team that had none of my friends on it. Changing teams can be a big deal, some could relate it to working for a better company than they were before, but these decisions don't come easily do they? No, they take time and who better to help you with these decisions than the people whom you trust the most. After about a week of receiving opinions from people such as my family and friends, I made this best choice for me, and it turned out great. I started having more fun hanging with my friends and we were winning more games. My old coach understood and I still keep in touch with him to this day. I know that without my peers, I probably wouldn't have made the same choice, and my other choice could have led to smaller consequences such as, not getting enough recognition or losing more games than we should be losing. Surround yourself with positive friends to help make the best decisions. You may be a police officer and have to make an on the job decision, well no worries there because you have some of the best guys in the world to help you make that decision. But what if you didn't have positive friends in your life and you weren't surrounded people that could help you make the right decision. Would you go down the wrong path? There are many things that can lead to wrong decisions,and there are many things that can lead to good ones. It depends on you and your friends and family. With all this being said, it is in your best interest to make sure you ask more than one person about how you could make a better choice. You may be into sports and you have your teammates to ask, or you may have a job and you have you co-workers to ask, however these people all have one thing in common, and that is that they will all lead you down the right path and help you make the best decision. Which is why multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. So will you go in at it alone, or will you have your friends and family help you make the best call?","This was what the 21st Century looks like.. People using cars more and more every single day to the point where half of us don't even want to take a lovely little stroll through the garden, over the bridge, and straight to the tree house. Nope. Nothing like that anymore. Ever since cars were created, it's given us a form to transport easier, but it's taken out a lot from the people. Among all the things they could be doing, they choose to sit in the car all day. Not anymore. There are people in different countries and states who are making a wonderful change in the world. It all starts in Vauban, Germany. People have no cars within their non-existant garages and people are paying thousands of dollars to park their car. Why? Well, consider it as a way to help the environment. Places like Germany, France, and small sections of the United States have banned cars because of the greenhouse gas emissions.  With a law that prevents cars, the states and countries can clean up the air quicker without any more polluting gas entering to make things worse. One of the greatest advantages for car bans is that there are less accidents. With rarely any cars on the streets, it prevents people from dying in car accidents or hit-and-runs. With this, we'll have less deaths and more people coming home safely to their families. With the majority of the population gaining weight from no workouts, car bans puts us in a different track. Whenever we need to go somewhere, we do it with a bit of exercise. Walking, biking, all that sweet jazz. We can become a better generation with just a little push and removal of something that restricts us from certain things. We've taken advangtage of cars by not putting so much work into getting the strength we need to keep us walking for more than just 20 minutes before our legs grow tired. The future is close, but we've still got a long road ahead of us to get to our goal. To cross that road, we've thrown all the cars off to the side and we'll walk, we'll ride our bikes, we'll dance our way over the other side. Whatever it takes to get to the other side, we'll take it.    ","Distance learning can be more beneficial than attending the classroom. All schools should have this option as it gives the students flexibility. Students being alone at home while they work help them focus better because it eliminates the distractions being in a classroom would cause. Having online courses is also more convenient. The one downside is no hands on instructions from the teacher. Students would need to look into whether or not they can complete their work on their own or would need hands on help before taking online courses. Online courses are more beneficial because the student has the ability to stay focus and maintain composure at home, the student is able to be more flexible with their time and kids who are getting bullied by going to school can take class at home. Classrooms full of people can take away a students focus off their work. If a student has trouble focusing online courses are meant for them. We make friends and like to joke and play and get distracted from our task. While some students can ignore whats around them others are curious and like to engage with others. By having online classes the students ability to focus increases dramatically and the quality of their work should rise. By not having distractions students are able to get more done. Also it eliminates the risk of the student getting in trouble at school. Lots of people like to pick with one another and online classes help avoid that. By having online courses students can be more flexible with their time and do more work in a quicker manner. Not having to wait on the class or the teacher to move on with the lesson. The student will be able to accomplish their tasks at their own pace. The student will not have to wake up early in the morning and will be able to get a proper amount of rest. The proper amount of sleep is essential to productive work. They also have the ability to do their work wherever they go rather than sitting in a classroom. While some students enjoy sitting in the classroom others are anxious and cant sit in a classroom. Online courses are amazing for students who understand time management because they can get work done on their own while saving time for other tasks. Students who are getting bullied will be able to have online courses as a substitute rather than taking going to school and dealing with bullies. Students getting bullied would not have to worry about anything other than their work and would be able to avoid the bullies. More students are getting bullied each year and are hurting themselves and others because of that. Everyone has their opinion about someone whether it be positive or negative. A lot of individuals are mean and will pick on someone who doesnt fit in. Also lessens the chance of discrimination as foreigners would feel more comfortable taking online classes. While the benefits of taking online classes over going to class is quite a few However theirs a downside that students would not have the teacher available for hands on instructions and would have to schedule a video chat if they need any help on the material. Schools should consider having online courses as it balances who needs to be at school for the help and who can do their own work on their own. The bullying rate would go down and the pass rate would go up because the student is able to focus at home. The students that still go to school benefits from this as well instead of having a thirty student class with one teacher the number is reduced and the teacher is able to help everyone who needs it and take their time teaching the material. While being in a classroom is great Online courses provide the benefits to a lot of students that will ultimately help them succeed in the end.            ",Some people feel that extracurricular activities are not beneficial for children and teens. I personally think that thet are very beneficial. These are some reasons why and how they benefit. You may not know this but 1 in every 3 kids are socially awkward. Making kids join an after school activity that they enjoy with other kids that enjoy the same thing as them will help them bond with others and make friends. This will also help with communication skills not only with adults but also with others. If they dont make mistakes and ask questions about their mistakes than they will never learn. Sports and extracurricular will also keep kids out of doing bad things. Most sports are like a gateway of getting away from drugs and drinking underage. Most sports teams have rules against posting pictures with red solo cups in them to keep the team and players safe. Colleges look at everything from grades to community service hours. Colleges also look for leaders at school and in the community. If colleges see that someone has good grades and is a leader in not only their community but at school as well that will really be beneficial. It is never too early to start applying and preparing for your future. As we know our countries obesity rates are going up daily due to new technology like phones and how kids are on their phones way too much and they don't get nearly any exercise. If kids dont learn how to put down the apple phones and pick up a real apple then before our eyes the country will jut get more and more oboes. Extra sports will help kids to burn calories and fat in a fun and healthy way. This is also a good source of exercise without having to go to the gym or having a gym membership. As we know everyone has their own thoughts and opinions about certain issues and decisions and to conclude I would just like to say please take my essay into consideration when making this decision. Thank you.,"I believe that driverless cars should be allowed for everyone. The cars could help certain people if they are occupied with something else. Some people may not be able to have a driverless car because even though it's driverless, they still have to be there in case of an emergency. Other people may just ignore the signals of the car and it could cause a wreck to occur. Driverless cars could benefit many people in many different ways. The driver may need to take an important business call, and they can do that while the car is still going. The person could also have an injury and need to go to the emergency room, but have no one else to take them there. If the person has children one of their kids could need something, so they could help them while still going where they need to go. Also, the driver could've woken up late and needs to hurry to work. They could finish getting ready in their car or eat their breakfast. They may need to finish their make up or brush their hair and you can't do that with both of your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. I also believe it would be diffucult to know who is at blame for a wreck. The car could mess up and it would be the manufacturers fault, but if the driver is not paying attention it would be their fault. The driver may not want to take responsibilty and admit to not paying attention to the signals of the car. The idea of having cameras in the car to watch the driver is very interesting. It may feel weird being watched by something, but it would help figure out who is to blame. The idea of driverless cars is a little frightening though. There are people that may take advantage of it and not pay attention to whenever they need to take control of the car. The idea is also excellent for someone that may need the time to do something else. I approve of the idea, but there is always the slight chance of someone messing it up. Hopefully if driverless cars become a thing, they will make everything safer and nothing bad will happen because of them. If driverless cars become a regular thing, I think they need to be figured out and practiced with a lot more. ",,,,,,,
293,825,"In society techolgy is almost every thing to people. People around the world hundred, thousands worth of technology, lots of people spend more money on technology than they clothes. So to me I think having technology makes people happy. Having technology to see if it makes them happy is kinda of point less to me. There is nothing the Facial Action Coding could do for people in the world if you ask me. Putting up Ads that is based off your emotion is not a smart idea to me. So if im angry im most likely will have a negative vibe and if you put something up that is close to be negative its not going to make me happy. If I am in a good mood more than likely I would not want to see no Ad. Then there expression is compared against a neutral face, some people just look naturally mad. If some one regular face looks mad then how would it read ther face then, that person could be happy. I think the Facial Action Coding System is a waste of time.","I think that drivers should not be able to operate while on the road because they can get easily distracted, they don't pay attention and could crash, they can fatally harm the people on the road. There have been a lot of different accidents because of people working on the road on their phone, or just not doing their jobs right from the start. Drivers get easily distracted when using their phone to make calls for business. According to EdgarSnyder. com the average amount of car crashes from using cell phones are about 1.6 million a year. The site also said that 94% of people support the ban for texting and driving. If drivers work on the road they are more likely to take phone calls or texts while driving, and that may result in a crash or an accident of some sort. On average there are 1.25 million deaths yearly by automobile. With people working on the road that average is going to double faster. Being able to talk on the phone or texting while driving with more people adding everyday to work on the road the more people that work on the road the more likely there is to be an accident, and the more accidents, the higher fatality rate. People will quit their jobs to work on the road and make money, From July to September about 2.4% of people voluntarily quit their jobs. Of the 7 billion people in the world 2.4% quit their jobs and that rate will grow fast. A lot of jobs that require working on the road like Uber, Lyft, Uber eats, Doordash, all have requirements for the job. Different companies have different ways of working, but most of the employees don't really pay attention to the rules because they think they don't need them. For those who don't pay attention or follow the rules, they suffer the consequences. Driving is an important part of people and their jobs as they commute to work every single day. If there are any distractions that take away the commute then there should not be a lot of people working on the road. In conclusion i think that people should not be able to work on the road. Drivers get easily distracted, they don't pay attention, they don't do their jobs. Working on the roads can get very distracting. Working on the road is very dangerous. It is very life threatening.   ",When asking for advice people want real opinions or information. So most people try to ask the person most skilled in what they want advice for. For example if you want advice for biking most people will not ask their math teacher. People want the best information they can get. So here are some reasons why asking several people for advice could be helpful and allow you to get better information. One reason why its a good idea to ask several people for advice is because one persons opinion can be bias compared to several people who can give different and new opinions. When you ask someone if for advice for getting a dog someone could say it the best thing that ever happened to me. But if you ask a different person they could say my dog ruined my life. And if you had never asked another person you could have bought a dog without knowing the risks as opposed to just knowing some positives. This situation could be applied to most situations when asking for advice. And to get the least bias information you can ask as many people as you want. This is one reason why you should ask several people for advice. Another reason to ask several people for advice is more detailed and overall better advice. If you are doing a school project on your family you will most likely ask your family for information of your families traditions and other information because you want your paper to be as detailed as it can be. So asking more that one family member could and will almost always give you more and better information. Because if you had asked one person unless your family if famous there will almost certainly not be a whole ton of information on your family on the internet. So you will probably not have a very detailed paper to turn in. This is just one more reason why asking several people for advice is helpful. The last reason I will be talking about is different peoples views and different experiences that you will get when asking for advice for something. If you are a news reporter and you are reporting at a crime scene you should ask as many people as you can for information to get the most detailed information possible. If you ask one witness their story could be completely different from someone else who has a different story. You can also ask the police and many other people. People want different views on news so it can be as correct as possible. So when asking for advice for what happened or anything remember different people have completely different views and experiences with what it is you want advice for. This is the last thing I will be talking about but there are many reasons to ask several people for advice. In conclusion asking several people for advice is a great idea. Because one persons opinion cold be completely bias on something. And because when asking several people for advice you will get more detailed and overall better information. Lastly you can get more than one view when asking for advice which could change an entire story. So these are some of the reason why you should ask several people for advice when asking for advice.              ,"In many parts of the world, cars are used on a daily basis. People use their cars everyday to get to work or any other place they go. These people should probably consider limiting their car usage. There are advantages to it and it can be beneficial. The limiting of car usage can be helpful to them and their city's environment. I think that the people should limit their car usage because it can lower air pollution and air pollution is one of the biggest problems many cities or countries in the world are facing. This is because those citizens use their cars too much and they don't limit how much they use it. On source 3 a businessman from Bogota, Columbia says that its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. In addition, citizens from every state and country should limit their car usage because they don't have to worry about traffic. These citizens should walk, take a bus or ride their bicycles to where they go. It can also save them time and avoid the trafficjam in the streets and it might help them get to their destination faster. Source 3 says that Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoided of traffic. More over, citizens should limit using their cars because in some countries around the globe many people are cooperating and taking the advantage of limiting their car usage. In some countries from Germany, there are families that do not own cars. On source 1 a media trainer and mother of two said that when she had a car she was always tense and now she's happy the way they are car free. In the city of Paris, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the global city . The usage of cars have created smog in different countries including Paris. In source 2 it says that motorists in Paris with even numbered plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. In conclusion, people from all the countries and cities of the world should take the advantage of limiting their car usage. It can benefit them by avoiding traffic if they ride their bicycles or walk, spending money on gasoline and get to where they need to go faster. Another advantage would be to avoid air pollution to the environment and city and help making it a better place by being a great and considering citizen and limit the amount of car usage.    ","According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house. A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school. This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school. In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school. The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.","The principle deciding that you have to do an extracurricular activity is like your parents choosing clothes for you and then they say that you have to wear them. Most people don't want to participate in extracurricular activities because they already have too much to do and they don't have the time. I disagree with the principle because students may have other things to do outside of school, there may not be anything that interests the students, and the students may already have other activities that they participate in. One reason I disagree is because students could have other things to do outside of school. The students could be babysitting their siblings, doing homework, hanging out with friends, or the may have a part-time job to earn money. For example, my older sister couldn't participate in extracurricular activities because she had to babysit me and she had her own homework to do. Sometimes my sister hung out with her friends, as well. Babysitting requires attention of the sitter, and doing homework takes concentration. There may not be anything that interests the student. Some activities could be limited and may only be there for a few days. In some schools there are things like that. There's an after school activity that you could go to and it's not there for more then a few days. One of my friends went to an activity and the day after she was happy and sad at the same time. She told me that there was a new club there and that it was really fun. She then added on and said that it's only there for two more weeks. She didn't go to after school, unless a teacher asked her to be there. Another reason is that the student could already have other activities that they participate in. The student could already have sports to play, like soccer, basketball, baseball, or football. They could also be on one of the schools sport team and could already be there for the training. For example, I have a cousin and he is in high school. He is also on the schools soccer team and he has to be stay after school everyday for two hours. Once he gets home, he does his homework, eats, and then goes to bed. So, he doesn't have the time or energy for extracurricular activities. In conclusion, having to do extracurricular activities is not a good idea. Students have other things to do, they may not like what choices they're being offered, and they may already have activities that they are participating in. The principles decision is like your parents choosing clothes for you because it may be nice, but you don't want it. You may be happy about it in the beginning but then you realize that you didn't have a choice in the matter. ","Cars that can drive themselves have been a fantasy for many years. They have been seen in movies and shows for quite a while, and many have hopes that someday, it will become a reality. With recent research and new developments, car manufacturers are beginning to actually make driverless cars possible. Altough there are many risks that could take place in the us of driverless cars, I believe that driverless cars should be made and used for everyone in the future. A driverless car would have dozens of benefits for drivers on the road. Because there would be sensors all around the car that monitor the car's surroundings at all times, there would be almost no crashes. As of now, there are already cars that can drive by themselves, however, if there is a obstacle on the road, it will alert the driver and allow him to take over. When car manufacturers can develop a way for these cars to detect obstacles and manuver around them, the road will a much safer place, and car crashes would almost become nonexistent. When everyone has a driverless car, there would not even be chance to have a crash, unless nature gets involved, since each car is on a course that is monitoring the road at all times. Not only would there be fewer car crashes due to collisions, but there would also be no more speeding or reckless driving from unresponsible or inexperienced drivers. Two of the main causes of car crashes today is the act of texting while driving and drinking while driving. If the car drives itself, then there would be no more distracted drivers that don't have their eyes on the road. A driverless car would allow the person in the drivers seat to focus on other things. When they develop cars that won't need a driver under circumstances, the person in the car may become bored, due to the lack of the thrill while driving. To solve this issue, these driverless cars would have in-car entertainment that would allow the owner of the car to not become bored. Another big benifit of driverless cars would be that they would use half the amount of gas and therefor not only saving the earth's limited amount of gas, but also saving people tons of money. As stated, I strongly believe that they use of driverless cars should become a reality in the future and that everyone should use them. This would further increase everyones safety on the road and lead to fewer injuries and crimes. Not only would driverless cars benefit others by helping them achieve their destination safely, but also by saving the earth's amount of gas and saving people's money.",,,,,,,
664,104,"""The evening star"" venus, is one of the brightest points in the sky. Venus is the second planet away from the sun. Venus can be reffered to as earth's twin because of size and distance from eachother. Earth, Venus, and Mars are the closest to eachother. There can possibly be life on Mars but not really on venus. Venus' temperature is really really hot which means there is automaticly no possible life on Venus. The text states ""on planet's surface temperatures average 800 degrees faranheit"". This let's me know that there is no possible life Venus. The text also states that ""Venus has the most hottest temperature on surface than any other planet"". That is another reason why,but it states in the text that it is 180 degrees farenheit when you are 30 miles plus away from venus. I don't think we can resist that type of temperature either, but it says that we can but hardly. The atmospheric pressure of venus is also crazy. The text states that ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience"". This let's me know that if try and go into the atmosphere, we would automatically explode. Many erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting happen in Venus as well. Even though mercury is closer to the sun, Venus still has the hottest temperature o surface. Scientists are still trying to study Venus to see if we can have a chance. You're probably thinking that if the planet is literally unable to live in, why still do visits? Well it states in the passage that ""it once was the most earthlike planet on our solar sytem"". The reason for this is because long ago, Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported various life forms. Scientist are really crazy for that and if they do send out people to study and stuff, they're just letting people die. The reason I say this is because the temperature and atmospheric pressure is insane. Personally I think that it is not a worthy pursuit to go travel to Venus and perform a few studies. You literally can die while going over there and if the person dies, how are you supposed to know the studies they performed. Honestly I wouldn't do it, but NASA does pay a lot of money, But what's more important, getting the money and have a possible chance of dying or just be safe and sound? Personally I would chose to be safe and sound because one, outer space doesn't really draw my attention. The second one is I would like to be safe and not go through that experience. Now which one would you choose?","Having ""electors"" vote for us from the electoral college is basically giving us, the people, no say into what we president we want. Why ask us the people to vote when you have someone or others to chose what they think we want for president? Changing the from electoral college voting to the popular vote can give us the people a voice for what we want and think is best for this country and it gives us a reason to vote. If we still electoral college voting then our voice as a country is not being heard. Giving us a voice in this country that we live in an enormous oppurtunity than what other countries around the world do not have the privelage to have. Giving us, the people, a voice brings us together as a country and it unifies us. It also means that not only do we have governent power but we have people power as a whole. Bradford Plumer from source 2 explains to us in his first subtitle what is wrong withe the electoral college and he startes that ""When you vote, you are not voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors, who then for the president of their choice."" That was an example of our people not having a voice because we are basically wasting our time voting because at the end of the day the slate of electors are the ones who end up chosing who they want as president. Why should we vote when our vote doesn't even matter? Moreover, I feel that us voting is a waste of our time because of this winner-takes-all method that Bradford Plumer states in the fifth paragraph of his article titled: The Indefensible Electoral College. The winner-takes-all method is when presidents travel to specific states in which they believe they would win in the electoral votes and some states do not get visited at all by neither of the canidates because the canidates do not feel like they would win their votes. I understand that the electoral college is a process in which was founded by our founding fathers and established it into our constitution so that there is a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Source 1). It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election. On a final note, the electoral college system is a unfair way of our countries presidents to be elected when we also have the votes of the people which have no effect on which canidate wins. Although, our founding fathers thought this was a terrific idea at the time of making this part of the constitution, in reality we have a much larger population today than they did in the past when they had made the constitution. Having have all these people in our country vote today for a canidate and later have the vote not take any effect which canidate should win is very unfair. I can understand the electoral college system working back then when it was first made because the population was still relatively minimal but now we must abolish it because the points that some electoral vote colleges get is very small compared to some other states. How would you feel if you were a canidate and got 99.9 percent of the votes and still lost?    ","Cell Phones were invented in 1973, however, they weren't owned by the public until the 80s. Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents. While driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road. When driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern. Because using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents. Many accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers. In 2011, it was reported that 23% of all car accidents each year involve cell phone use. The National Safety Council reports that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by drivers using cell phones. Leaving about 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by being on the phone while driving. Cell phone use causes many accidents because of the distractions it causes and should be illegal to use while driving. Cell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver. Because of cell phones being used while driving there have been about 390,000 injuries each year. Therefore, we should ban drivers from being able to use their cell phones.   ","Every human being has been in the situation of needing or receiving help from someone. Whether it's asking advice from your grandpa, mom or brother, as a human, none of us are perfect and we need to receive advice from someone. Seeking advice from one person is great, but have you ever thought about why people ask more than one person for advice? Asking for more than one persons advice is not only helpful, but it will give you a more depth and clear mindset. People's advice matters and I can say it makes an impact on my personal life, everyone is different and it can help you form an opinion. Asking for multiple inputs for the topic of advice, hits very close to home for me. After I moved from the United Kingdom to United States of America. I was sad and had the feeling of anxiety of talking to and meeting new people as I had made so many friends in the UK and no one in America wanted to talk to be or be my friend. I felt like I wasn't meant to be in this world, but then my dad took me into our formal dining room and sat me down. I talked to him about the whole situation and told him about my worries and asked him for advice. He gave me advice on how to cope and to deal with situation. I had suddenly felt a lot better. I then started to be more open about my feelings and talked to multiple people like my school consular, mom, brother and even a classmate. Now I have a lot of friends that I can rely and depend on because of the advice I took from multiple people. Therefore, asking for advice from more than one person can change or have a huge impact on someones life. Getting advice from multiple people is helpful in the decision making process for a better decision. The more people that give advice, the better your decision will be. When asking multiple people for advice or anything, the person is forming a better decision or result whereas asking advice from one person, the person is only listening to one opinion and it is not as good or reliable. Listening to more than one person for advice will help the person form a plan that they could use for not only for one specific situation but multiple events. If multiple inputs are given to you on a specific topic, you can use the skills and tactics that the person learned from the people who gave them advice to apply while making a decision of when and how to satisfy the problem. Multiple people giving advice can help the person form an opinion on a topic. For example, if the person is asking for advice on politics from an elder or several other people, by listening to them, the person can form a valid or personal opinion that he or she likes. Therefore, getting advice from multiple people can help you make a decision a proper and valid decision. Everyone is different and different advice can help you become a better human being. When asking multiple people for advice, you have to keep in mind everyone is different. For example, when asking your mom, dad, brother or grandpa for their advice on politics, they are all going to have different opinions and answers, and it's the job of the person to make and pick a decision that they personally agree with. Multiple peoples opinion on something will help the person form a different perspective of a topic. For example, several people giving the person advice on a topic of something like depression will help them find a different perspective of the topic like the bright side of it or that some people aren't as fortunate. Everyone is different and people have multiple opinions on a topic or situation which can help them find more than one solution in the decision making process when asking for advice. For example, if a person has an opinion on a topic, asking multiple people for advice can help them form new and different ideas that they can use to help formulate multiple opinions to help them use in finding a solution for a problem. Therefore, everyone is different, and when asking for advice, multiple or different views will strengthen your thought and help you think diversely. In conclusion, when facing a problem that you want to solve and get rid of, ask more than one person for advice on how to get rid of it. It is important to ask for multiple peoples advice because everyone is different, it can help you form a final decision or opinion and I can relate and confirm through a personal experience on why asking for multiple peoples advice is important. Advice is something we all need, whether we are down or happy, it helps us relate and find a solution for everything. Therefore, multiple peoples opinions will help us make a better choice.                        ","Hello everyone. Today I am going to talk about the disadvantages of taking a home school program, one of the down sides of taking a home school program, it would be the students effort,and development of skills, and abilities. students develop many skills throw classroom work such as communication, team work, and leader ship. when a student works in groups they learn new ways of solving problems,and learn the values of working as a team, and with the home school program a student won't develop the same skills in fact that would affect them later on. many times students compete to be the best, to finish faster, to get better grades,because they wanna stand out from the others. but when a student works alone there most likely going to give less effort and there going to feel like there doing the best that they can,when there not. for example when a soccer player or football player is trying out to get in a team for the first time they think i am good i can do this. but when they see the abilities of others. they wanna work hard to be at there level because he know that there better than him. but that gives him motivation to prove and challenge him self to see what hes capable of. the fact that students get to work in groups is amazing because students learn from each other and it becomes less stressful. for example when a group has to do a project everyone is going to have a job, and everyone can share there points of view to make sure everything is at its best, and working in a group makes everything easier and it cut the amount of time to finish. and working alone it would be more stressful because the student has to do more work, and he wont see all the problems when other people could. even tho theses students that will love to do the job at home they know participating in class helps a lot to remember what they have learned. and its easy to say when a student is home it wont put as much effort that a student in classroom because he will take a lot of time to finish his work when in a class room the students have a time period. in conclusion a student thats attending to classes is going to be more successful than a student thats taking classes at home because of the simple fact that the student that is in the class room is participating on activities and working with other students, learning new ways to solve problems. and the student that takes home school its not developing the simple skills of communication, team work and leader ship because hes going to have to work and do things on his own.","Summer-break, which traditionally takes place in June/July and ends August/September, is a great time off, a far distance given from the classroom. Because of this great distance from a learning environment and the fact that the summer break is the longest out of every other break in the school year, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they keep up to speed, with school content. These summer projects are traditionally teacher based, but recent years have given students more freedom. However, these summer projects should remain teacher-designed because of the content covered in the classroom, as well as the teacher having knowledge on what material will be covered in that following year after summer break, given that they actually end up teaching the content planned for that year, which is a valuable insight for the students. Additionally, many students are still in touch with the classroom environment, and it gives a smoother transition to those students who come back from their periodic break. Teachers in the classroom face a struggle, that comes after the periodic amount of time that summer break takes. What will the content consist of? What will be the new learning objectives for the students when they come back from their break? That is why during the summer break, teachers designing specific projects that aim to target learning objectives that they themselves know, are important for the students to get a grip of, as well as still sticking to the curriculum, which greatly benefits students in the way that they actually get a sneak peek of what next year's curriculum could be built as. In addition to this, students get valued ""class time"", so even though they might be on their summer breaks, and they might not possibly do the projects to the best of their abilities, they are still soaking up valuable education time that you could only gain in class. For example, in schools that do not hand out or require students to complete projects during the time of the summer break, these students tend to forget some important learning objectives, simply due to the fact on how much time students have spent outside of school. But those who do indeed assign summer projects, give students a peek into the upcoming school year, which definitely does give a boost to the students preceding knowledge prior to the school year, as well as encouraging possible additional studying, which all leads to a future of a bright learning environment. Another important factor on why it is essential for schools to give out teacher-designed projects is to bring out more of the ""integration period"", or coming slowly, back to the school environment in order to prepare them for learning. Teachers find this valuable so that they can get their students ""accustomed"" to their classroom environment before even stepping through the door, which is very precious for most teachers, given that in a school year, teachers take around a month and a half before all the assignments and daily motions become routine. In a time where every period counts, this is a major victory for teachers, as their designed projects can go over and reflect on the material that they hope to teach their students, which gives them a starting to the school year edge, above all. Students often struggle at the beginning of the year at first, because of the time they have taken off, without any classroom instruction, which is also an adjustment period. Teacher-designed projects enable students to take the initiative, while on vacation and step up to learn important material that has basis, and will be taught in class at some point. Even though student projects allow for the students to choose their own projects, and whatever central topic of focus that they have the most interest in, students will still choose topics that might not be relevant to them in education, whereas teachers have the best idea due to the fact that they, and them only teach the curriculum. In addition, teachers know exactly what learning objectives are prioritized, while students might have a faint idea, but not close to what the teachers understanding of the goals and learning objectives that he might have set for his/her students. Specific examples would include how in English, summer reading projects would be assigned so that when the students returned back, they would have that ""touch"" with their books, and their education beforehand, so rather than deal with the trivial, novel things that teachers would normally do at the beginning of the year, they are allowed to follow the curriculum, full stretch. In conclusion, teacher-designed projects help students due to the amount of content covered in the classroom, as well as teachers having knowledge on what will be covered after summer break which benefits students greatly, and begins the integration into the classroom, before even stepping foot into the classroom. This also alleviates the pressure on teachers greatly, as they can plan more accordingly giving their own designed summer projects to their students in the classroom. Students benefit from this due to how they are accustomed earlier then usual in the classroom, while teachers are benefited due to how they are able to focus on specific learning objectives that might be of importance. ","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I don't think its fair that only students with a grade B average are allowed to participate in school sports. Many students that enjoy playing sports do not have a grade B average. If this policy was on, then not many people would be allowed to play. Many famous sports players weren't grade B average when they went to school. What if a student loves to play Basketball but wasn't allowed to play just because he had a C on his report card. That would be like interfering with his future if some day he wants to become a professional Basketball player. It shouldn't really matter what there grades are to let them do something they enjoy and love. I know that you would be mad if somebody told you couldn't play your favorite sport just because of some grade. Just because you have low grades on your report cards doesn't mean your bad at everything. I myself get a D once in a while but I'm good at acting and playing Volleyball. It really hurts when somebody forbids you to do something that you enjoy doing just because you have one D or F. Please think of the students that you will be hurting. That probably will think that they are not good enough for anything. Don't make them believe that because everybody is good at something, but this policy will leave them thinking that there dumb. So please think twice of what decision your going to take and remember, you don't want to let your students know that they are not good for nothing. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
664,220,"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant. Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment. Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus. NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus. They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy. According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point. Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them. The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.","I think we should keep the electoral collage beacause it has worked this long for us so we know its gonna work so why not keeep it going. It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    ","Phones and Driving Using your phone while driving, everyone knows it's illegal to do this. Using your phone while driving is dangerous thing to do because your looking at the road. You can't see where you're going or what's in front of you. This doesn't stop people from being on their phones though. In some cases though being on your phone for an emergency can help you be aware of where you need to be at that time. Being on your phone posses a lot of danger for you and everyone around you. One person alone can cause a car rekt if they're on their phone. Because of this laws are put in place, but sometimes people will ignore those laws and be on their phone anyway. Causing a car crash or themselves panic a bit and speed up and nearly hit the car in front of them. Pretty much when you're driving, don't be on your phone because if you hear a car rev their engine you might think that the traffic is finally moving and hit the car in front of you because you were on your phone not paying attention. You should have very low phone usage since you're driving. If someone calls you while you're driving and it's a emergency, you shouldn't stay on the phone for long. Staying on the phone will cause you to focus more on the phone, without you being careful like you normally would when you're driving, because you're trying to get somewhere fast since it's an emergency. Instead of being careless of others around you, take your time when trying to get to that emergency, be mindful of what you're doing. You should never be on your phone and drive even if it's an emergency because you're caring about the other people around you, you just care to get to that emergency fast. In some cases though being on your phone can be 'helpful' in a way. Let's say you're on your phone and you get a text, you're going to look at the text regardless even if you're driving. When looking at the text, make sure you've stop stopped somewhere to look at it or in this case when you're driving, look to see if any cars are around you. Obviously texting while driving is the worst thing you can do. So when you're going to text while you drive make sure you look to see how many cars are around, stay mindful of your surroundings, and if possible try to find a spot and stop so can see the text without endangering anyone else because you're not looking at the road. In conclusion to being your phone when driving. You shouldn't do it even if it's an emergency or you just want to check your social media feed. You put yourself and everyone around you in danger because you're paying attention. If you decide to go on your phone though make sure you're stopped or at least almost no one is around you. Pretty much just stay off your phone when driving to keep yourself and others safe.         ","When I need someone to talk to or need some advice I always go to multiple people. When I was fighting with my friend, I went to my friends and parents to ask for advice. Not just one person but multiple people. Multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. It might be going to your parents, friends, or teachers, but getting multiple opinions is much better than one. Parents are often the people kids or adults go to. Since they have been around longer and been through drama before, they might know more than your average friend. Parents always have good advice to give. There advice will help you with a lot of things your going through. Most of the time kids go to there parents because they dont like other peoples opinions and they just want to here what a adult thinks about the situation. Parents will help you make a smart, reasonable decision on what to do. Lots of people go to their friends for advice because their friends might know more about that person than your parents or teacher do, or they think they can relate since there both young or the same age. There friends might give good advice if they have gone through the same thing or something similar. Thats why people go to their friends for help. It's also because many people don't trust other people and think they might tell the person your fighting with what you were taking about. So they go to there parents or their best friend for help so it dosn't cause any more drama. It's good to have multiple opinions because there other people that could have more knowledge than most, or you can trust one person better than the rest. Multiple opinions matter because they help someone make a better decision on what do, just like when I went to my parents and friends for advice. They helped me make the right decision on what to do about the fight. There advice helped me so much. If I had asked one person it think the fight would have gone down differently. Multiple peoples opinions matter in making smart choices.      ","Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn. Desagree:.

Other school don't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because that's not great way to learn because students wouldn't benefit being able to attend classes from home because if they don't understand something who can help them, distance learning is not the best way to learn because you need some school to learn what you need to know like student that you are and If you take classes from home you can learn but if you take the classes direcly from some school thatone is the best way that you to learn. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do like the people who came to this country from another country and don't live with their parents this guys have to work and study at the time so that's why I think is not benefit to attend classes at home. For example the people who came to this country, they came for a better future, better opportunities and they need to learn a new languaje and that's not easy for everybady some people learn very quickly but other people not. calsses by way online that's great for some student because they have a great idea and reasons to take classes from home for example some student have child and they have to care about their baby's so they can't go to school for them that's a great opportunuty to study and do what they want, this people just need motivation to keep going and they can gain their goals. I think students they don't be benefit attend classes from home because at home they have too many things that can be disctracte for them with things like electronic devices, or persons like childrens, and any other distract thing. Video conferencing that's good form to learn for some people who want to attend classes from home but if you have any question or any dude you can't ask to this video that's why I thing that the best way to learn is going to school and work hard every day to do and study what we want to do in the future, we have our future in our hand if we do any bad thing some day we pay for that, always we have to think and be sure for what we want and do. in this life everything the we do to somebody good or but someday that thing comeback to you and there woud you feel what other people someday fool for your foult.

There is an ongoing debate that students should get summer projects. Those who oppose state that students will get no free time and they will not do it, but this is not true. Although some may disagree students need summer projects to keep up with school. There are a variety of reasons why students should get summer projects. The students might forget most of the subjects they learned over the school year. The project will be there to refresh their minds and keep them up to date. So students wont fall behind when school starts back up. Students won't be confused back from school. They will have some knowledge back from school because of the project. Students will also be able to keep up with the teacher and the work. Students would have a great start to the school year. They could start off with good grades and wont start off struggling. There are furthermore reasons why students should get summer projects. It will give students something to do over the summer. Some students just lay around doing nothing or playing video games all day. Most students just be at home on their phones texting and calling people, but now they can do the project and learn something. They could learn something new over the summer because of the project. Students. Work on a subject they were struggling with during school to improve on it. working on a project could help them learn about other subjects. This project will most likely keep them out of trouble. It will stop them from going to unnecessary parties and doing dangerous activities. The project will keep them from staying out late and getting involved with the police and causing trouble for their parents. Although some may disagree, students should get summer projects. This is the case due to improvement in grades and could learn something new. Those who oppose state students will forget, not do the project, and wont learn anything, but this not true. Believe that students should get projects over the summer because it will help them when they reenter school. ","Dear, Principal I really don't like that i idea because some people have C' s and they are really good at sports. But i also think that's a good idea because that would make students study more for they can have better grades. But i don't really know if its a good idea or if it is!!! Ok i think that its a good idea because it might get students to make a good grade, For a better life. And if they study and they are good at sports that is going to help the in life because they might get a scholarship for doing that. But I think that right now they have a rule that says that "" if you don't have a C or higher that u cant get in any of the sports "" If you want to do that, guess that would be a good thing for me!.. I think that my friends will be ok with it too. I think that with a C we are ok. mostly of the wrestler's have at least a C. And if we change that rule, we will lose many of our good sport people. And we will lose every single game, that wouldn't be a good thing for our school. but i really think that u shouldn't . I just guess that , well that's my opinion i don't really know what you are going to chose but please don't change it. its going to be issue with some people because they really want to be in sports and they wont be able to! i sometimes get good grades but if i don't .If i mess up for one report cared i wont be able to get in the sport i want to get in. I don't really think that I would get lower that a C . its because other people don't get higher that a C. and B is going to be WAY harder to them. we have fun day! and if we don't get a C or higher we don't go to that! Or if we have a referral, if we get sent to the principals office, or something like that we wont be able to go. Some people didn't go because of the grades.

664,728,"Exploring Venus Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes. However, he does not support this claim very well as he gives only one vague reason to explore it, he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it, and provides very few actual solutions. First of all, he does a good job of naming the several dangers and obstacles of exploring Venus such as the extreme atmosphiric pressure. The main problem though, is the temperature wich as the author states, ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" (Paragraph 3). This poses a problem as most metals and other materials melt at such high temperatures. However, the author fails to give very many solutions to these issues. The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated. Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced. These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions"" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand. But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus. Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus. This reason of his is,""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (Paragraph 4). The problem with this is that it does not go very deep into why it being similar to Earth matters. A scientist at NASA might understand any signifigance in that statement, but an average person might not. For that reason it is a very weak argument. In short, The author does not support his idea for exploring Venus very well because he only gives one vague reason to explore it and he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it while providing very few actual solutions. Had he named more solutions and reasons to explore Venus it would have supported his idea far more. He named too many dangers without ways to properly combat them, which is why the author's support for his claim was weak.","We should keep our method of chosing a president even though many dont agree because of a few reasons.  One, big states.  Two, avoid run off eclections. Finnaly, to determide the certainty of outcome. First, the issue of big states.  States are put in two catogories, big states and small states, accoring to population. Presidential candidates give more of their attention during the campain to the larger states.  As a result of electral college the big states have more elctors and thus more votes.  For example, in Forida, the popular vote was extermly close in 2012,  Obama who won, got 29 electoral votes.  If obama had spent that time in Wyoming, he would have only had gotten 3 electoral votes. Second, to avoid run off elections. Using the eectoral college we avoid the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority.  the electoral college can procuce a clear winner rather than pressure when no canidate wins majority and complications of the process. Two examples of this in 1968 and 1992 with president Nixan and president Clinton.  They both had 43 percent pluarlity of popular vote, while winning a majority of elcetoral college. Finnally, to determine Certainty of outcome. Since, almost all states have electoral votes on a winner takes all basis, even the slightest pluarlity in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in tht state. Although, it is possible to have a dispoute over the outcome of an electoral colege, for instance in 20000, it is much less likley than a dispute over the popualr vote. And even though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number of 538, it is extremly unlikey to happen. You could argue that the method of slecting a president through Electoral college may turn off potential voters for a canidate that has no hope if carrying their state,  knowing their vote will have no effect.  Then they might have less incentive to pay attention to the campaingn. But being realisic, no voters one vote swings a natioal electon, and about one half of the eligable American population did vote in 2012's election. In conclution, the reasons we shoud kee our current method of chosng the countroies president is becuause of big states, to avoid run off elections, and to determine he certainty of outcome. Even though some dont agree it has been working for us in the past an can contiue working for us to chose our president in the future.            ","Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that. Let's start with texts, social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rearview mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking. As for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car. Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction. Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.   ","Do you have a problem that you are struggling to solve? Why don't you ask your friends for advice? When people ask for advice on solving a problem, often times they speak to more than one person. This is because different views are better for figuring out a tough problem, many opinions are better than one, and other people may have experienced a problem like yours and may be able to help you in making better decisions. Different views are better for figuring out a tough problem, if only for the fact that they are different from yours. Asking more than one person their opinion helps greatly, because you receive a wide range of views different from your opinion. No one is exactly the same, and that goes for their opinions too. You may not like the answers you receive, but they can help you with your problem. Many opinions are better than one, because every opinion is different. Seeking out more than one person for their opinions helps you more than just going to one person. Each person you ask is going to have a different take on your problem, and help you in solving it. Others' opinions may be weak, but those opinions can give you ideas, and from those ideas sprout possible answers. These possible answers, and the people that gave you those possible answers, are going to be the main factors in whether or not you solve your problem, so keep them close, because you're going to need them. Other people may have experienced a problem like your and may be able to help you in making better decisions, so don't turn them down. Their experience with a problem like yours may become you greatest asset in solving your problem. Anyone can offer an opinion, but few people have actually had to solve that problem. Listen to everyone, but pay special attention to the ones who have solved that problem before. Those people are the ones who can guide you, help you with that problem the most. When people need help in solving a problem, they often go to other people for advice. This is because different opinions are better for solving a problem, many opinions are better than one, and other people may have experienced a problem like yours and may be able to guide you in making better decisions. These people will want to help you, and you should allow them to. Next time you have a tough problem to solve, go to others for advice, because they can help you solve it.","I think students get benefit, because I see some of they who recieved their diploma at home. And I think if they won't benefit, so why they received their diploma at home? They recieved their diploma, because they learn everything about the classes or courses that they choose, or they learn everything about what their read or watching, so that's why I think they get benefit take classes at home because if they choose to do the classes at home or online, that mean they can. One of the most importante things that I see is how some students sacrified to take their classes at college, stay there, sleep there run to work, because if they doesno't work how they should be pay for the classes? They can pay the classes in calm, taken the classes at home there they will be not tired to do their homeworks at night where is too late, because they are taken the classes onlien in their home where it doesno't matter at what time you go to bed because you don't have to wake up on time to go to college. Here is another things that you can be get benefit if you take the classes online: You get time to do any other things at home while you are doing your homework or watching a video about your classes. When you are doing your homework and if the homework is watching a video, and if you are at home you have to write so fast, because you are at home so that's mean you can stop the video and copy the answer in calm. You can read in calm your answer to be sure that are correctly. You can take the classes at the time you want or that's what I think I don't know, but if you are at home you can make your own time to do everything and order. You will be safe because you are at home. You don't have to worry at mornings to drive all the way to college. If you are taking the classes at home You don't have can get a traffic and be late at college. Your family can feel happy, because you are at home and not to far way from home. In my oponion this a good benefit, because every effort you do is a good is a good benefit, because you do this with your heart for every students is a dream go to college, so I think it doesno't matter the way you choose to go to college, the only thing that really matter is if you can dream it, you can do it.","At last it's summer time! I can sleep in everyday and do whatever I please. However, I still have to consider the unpleasant thought of finishing my summer assignments before the end of summer vacation. Although some may say otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students the opportunity to choose the material they want to learn and it will motivate students to complete the projects on time rather than wait until the end of the summer. First of all, school projects should be student-designed because it gives the students the opportunity to choose the material they want to learn which will make the projects more interesting since they will be geared towards their interests. For instance, when I was in 10th grade at Generic_School, I was assigned a project along with a group of students in my AP World History class where we were to research any period of history and make a PowerPoint presentation to present to the class. As a group, we agreed on choosing the Great Depression because we all had a decent amount of background knowledge about the specific topic. Therefore, each group member could contribute their views and researched information to the presentation, meaning there wasn't one member who didn't participate in the project. Furthermore, another instance would be when my sister, Generic_Name, was assigned a project in her orchestra class at Generic_School where she was given the project to find a song online and play it for the class. The thought of choosing her own song brought her so much joy since she could choose a song by some of her favorite artists: Owl City, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry. She decided on choosing the song Blank Space by Taylor Swift becuase it wouldn't be too challenging or to easy for her to play. Each day, leading up to the due date, she practiced for at least an hour so she could play for the class without any mistakes. Generic_Name forgot that she was doing a school project because of how much fun she was having playing the song. Projects don't have to be something to dread completing when they can be easily geared towards the students interests, leading to substantial success in the end. Additionally, school projects should be student-designed because it movivates students to complete their work on time rather than wait until the end of the summer to tackle the assignments, which will overall boost their performance. For example, In the summer of 2019, I was assiged to read at least one book and prepare to talk about it the next school year. Rather than having to read some random book picked by the school or county, I was able to choose a book that I would actually read for the purpose of entertainment, in contrast to just reading it because it was required. I chose to the novel, IT, by Stephen King because I enjoy the horror genre and he happens to be one of the most well known horrer fiction writers. I started out reading the book during the first week of summer with no major thoughts, that was until I realized I had been reading for two hours, wanting to read more and more. I became intrigued by the story and wanted to know what would come next. After only a week, I managed to finish the novel, the time flew by so fast because I was genuinly having a good time reading which rarely happens. Another example is when the Korean singer, Generic_Name, on the Korean surivial show known as Produce 101, was given the task during the first week of the competition to choose a dance for her assigned idol group. After congregating with her group, Generic_Name had her mind set on the dance to the song Into The New World by Girls Generation. The song fit perfectly with the group in a sense that the choreography was not too advanced for each of the members to learn, but it still looked smooth and well put together when done well. When the day of the dance battle came, Generic_Name and her group danced to the best of their ability, putting a lot of emotion and hard work into the dance. As a result, her group came in first place which meant that every member in the group was saved from elimination that was to take place that week. When people are given the the task that involves an interest of theirs, they will be likely to excell at that task. Some may say that when students are given the opportunity to choose what they want to learn, they will take advatage of that and pick something easy or irrelevant to learn. While understandable, that reasoning is flawwed due to the fact that teachers monitor students work in order to keep them on track. For instance, when I was in 7th grade at Generic_School, I chose a topic for my science project that went beyond the realm of 7th grade science. As a result, my teacher, Generic_Name, geared my in the correct direction by giving me a list of topics to choose from that correlated to the currect unit we were learing about. Some may also say that students get discouraged by the thought of summer projects in general, meaning they won't want to work on them at any cost. While understandable, that reasoning is flawed because when students are given the chance to choose something they feel strongly passionate about, they will be far more likely to work towards completing the project. For instance, when my friend, Generic_Name, was given the initiative to find statistics in his AP Statistics class at Generic_School, he chose to research statistics about his favorite game called League of Legends that included the number of people in each country When given the chance, students can surely succeed and learn a lot of information when the school projects are student-designed. In our society, school work and school activities are predominately controlled by the administration such as teachers and staff, but students have just as equal ideas as everyone else about school work and can possibly better the education system by making school more enjoyable for students all around the world.","Dear principal, It is unfair to not allow students to participate in after school activities if the student doesn't get at least a B average. This completely unfair to students because after school activities allow students to express themselves outside school. Students are unable to express themselves in the classroom, but after school activities really allow students to be themselves. It is unfair that school can dictate how a student chooses to express themselves. Not having after school activities can also affect the student's grades because after school activities can relieve stress with schoolwork, but if that student is unable to have after school activities, and just schoolwork to think about, they would be more stressful with school and it could really affect their focus. This then could affect the students grades. A students grade could get even worse without after school activities. A student's schoolwork, and social life should be kept individually. After school activities is a great chance for students to relieve stress with schoolwork, and let students to do something outside of school that they really enjoy doing. Students shouldn't have to focus on school all the time because other activities are just as important in helping a student grow. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
664,825,"Have you ever wondered what venus is like? Well studying venus can be very dangerous with its carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, extremely high temperature and more. Even though it can be dangerous it is a worthy pursuit. Studying venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our sister planet, we are very curious about it, and human can survive venus conditions. Venus is known as Earths sister planet but we don't know much about it and have never attempted going there. Venus is Earths sister planet because the text talks about how venus is the cloest planet to earth based on size and density. Also Venus has features like vlley, mountains, and craters like earth does and Venus shows that it was most likely covered in oceans long ago and could of supported various life forms. This is why we should explore venus because it is our sister planet Human curiosity plays a big role into why we should explore Venus. Humans are very curious about the planet since it shows signs that life could of lived there. Also it resembles Earth so much that we want to know more about its geogrpahy. In general we want to know more about this planet and get up close to it and observe it directly instead of from a far. We also want to know what gases there are and so maybe we could build something that wouldn't melt when it lands. This is how human curtiosity plays a role in discovering Venus. Venus also is a worthy pursuit becuase the text states the temperature is 170 degrees and it states humans can survive on this planet. So even though the temperature and atmosphere seem very dangerous it is worth the exploration because humans can survive so with proper training we could explore Venus. The article also talks about NASA building something to get 30 feet off of Venus so if we can get that close then eventually we will be able to get on the planet. In conclusion Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it shows many dangers. We can overcome those dangers and make traveling to Venus less dangerous. Since its our sister planet it is worth exploring to find more out about our own planet even. Our human curiosity makes us want to explore Venus in more depth. Also humans can survive on it so with new technology and training they can travel there and be safe. This is why traveling to Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our sister planet, we are curious about it, and humans can already survive on it.       ","The Electoral College is a really good process that I think they should keep. This Electoral college was found by the founding fathers and it is used so that the citizens could vote and the congress. The citizens get to have the right to vote on who they want to be presidant. After everyone voted the votes are counted up in each state and it shows which states voted for different people. The congress have a meeting of the electors and get to all vote. All votes for the congress are counted out seperatly then citizens. This is a the start of why I think Electoral College is fair and equal all around. In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors. After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records. There are mainly 5 reasons in why the Electoral College should stay. First is the Certainty of Outcome which shows that there cant be a dispute because it is based on popular vote. The next reason is Everyone is Presidant, this means that the presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. Another reason is Swing Sates which is the winner take all method. They are usually whatching campaigns and really listen to the other candidates, thoses poeple are usually thoughtfull voters. The next great reason is Big States, this shows if you win a big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes. The last reason is Avoid Run Off Elections, this avoids the problem of no candidates recieves a majority of the votes in the east. Their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to. Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant. What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters. After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            ","Phones were created to alert people if a crisis were about to begin or to contact loved ones from far away for long periods. Over the years, phones have since upgraded into cell phones that can fit anywhere. They are very efficient and much lighter to carry around. Cell Phones nowadays help get minds off of certain things that disturb daily lives by entertaining the brain. Some people argue that cell phones help with safety issues but that's far from the truth because cell phones lead to serious accidents and communication problems on the road. Without a doubt, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones on the road because it causes a lack of focus and leads to serious accidents. This is a major issue since drivers are usually on their phones all the time. For example, ""the major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts the attention of the driver"" (Scotti, 2007). This leads to putting the passenger at risk of injury. Along the same lines, this can be very dangerous if the driver has earbuds in his or her ear. For instance, ""cell phones reduce the driver's performance""(Gravelle, 2005). The driver can be impaired and no longer able to hear what's going on, which can lead to confusion on the roads and cause the driver to make the wrong turn. Some may argue that texting while driving is dangerous and may lead to serious injuries but, that's the opposite. Texting has proven to be the quickest way of getting work finished without having to be in the office or the school building. It's a great help with accessing the shops online rather than using a map. For example, ""using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic"" (Sturnguist, 2006). In the same way, this makes it easier to decide on what outfit to wear that day. Not only does it help with weather issues it can also help with navigating the quickest way from accidents. However, driving while having a cellphone in hand is still against the law, and can lead to suspension or worse jail time. People on the road believe that if they wear their seatbelt, it can protect them from accidents but this is only half correct. It provides the passenger with somewhat of a small chance of protection but a higher risk with or without it on. Studies have highlighted that ""drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decisions causing serious accidents involving other vehicles"" (Gravelle, 2005). This is the main reason why cell phones shouldn't be in your hands while driving. As an example, especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation and pay less attention to these areas, increasing the risk of fatal accidents. (Gravelle, 2005) Along the same lines, people need to stop having cellphones in hand. It's going to cause suffering later. Drivers should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it leads to serious accidents. These accidents could lead to paralyzation or death. The fact that people still do this is scary. It's highly dangerous and risky to be doing this at all. Hopefully, in the future, they will create some type of equipment to detect people with phones in hand, because if they don't more drivers and their passengers may face death and destruction.         ","Have you ever been stuck in a difficult situation, and it seems like you'll never get out? Next time when your in something like that try consulting multiple people over just one. You would do this because getting multiple peoples opinions can help prevent the out come from being bias and help you get a better perspective of whats actually happening in someones else point of view. People are bias about everything! If it's politics or a certain friend. Point is everyone has something that they care a lot about, but sometimes that something they care a lot about can become bias to a situation. If your ever in a tough spot or in an argument get multiple peoples thoughts on the situation so you know its not bias. It will help better the out come, and it may also help you make the right choice. Getting multiple peoples perspectives on a situation can also help you make the right choice. If you get multiple perspectives you can see the situation from different spots to help you better understand it. Also it will help you get more knowledge on the subject. Then you can understand what is going on all around not just in your head. This will help by making it more understandable. When asking for advise talk to multiple people so that you; Avoid bias opinions, and you can get multiple perspectives on the situation. These things will help better your opinions, and help you make the right choice. ","Do you really think student are going to learn just sitting on their vidoeo game? The issue that the studenrs are going to come across is that they are not getting the help they need and they are not even smart enough. Stiudents studying at home is not something that should be allowed anywhere, although yes school is boring and there is nothing to do, but we should be blessed to have a free public school. Other places around the world parents/gardians have to pay so much money that it is just redicouls and the majority of students don't go to school because they don't have the funds for it. Home school should not be around, because the students are taking the bafit of the home and most of the home school student don't graduate or finish high school because they are too busy being home doing all the unimportant things when they should be in school getting work done and hopefully graduating. In case students do take the online schooling they should at least have someone monter them and see the progress they have done every wee or two, this way it is going to lower the mount for students that don't graduate.","Students should design their own summer projects because they can make the project about things they learned over the summer or while they were in school. Having to the project in their own way should make it more better for the students to learn more on how to make a project, come up with ideas about the project, and get the feel on how to do things on their own without a teachers assistants. Having a project to do on you own makes things go easier for you without a teacher way of how they want the project to be. Although if a teacher designs the summer project for the students it will save the trouble of a student having to think of what their project should be about and the students will not just make the project on anything they shouldn't make it about. Firstly, if the students design the project of their decisions they will feel more comfortable working on something they designed without a teachers opinion and they can do it at their own paste instead of having a teacher telling them when its due. And when students design the projects by them selves they get a chance to teach themselves more and learn more from their mistakes so when next time they have a project to do they will have it down packed. Also the students can take summer school where they can have access to book to help they with there summer project and computers where they can get resources to look up information about the project their designing. But students should take the project serious so they can understand how to make projects on their own so if a time comes when they to do it again without any assistants it will be more be better the next time. Secondly, if the students design the summer project it will be more fun if they deign it because there friends can all help and work together to make the project fun and they can challenge each other to see who can make the best project and but also in a correct way. The project can also be fun because the project can be about things they like such as a favorite sport, favorite food, or even favorite place to go doing this should make the students more interested in doing the project on there own without a teacher. If the students can make the summer project more fun by making the the project about things they wanna or like doing it will push the the students to make to project strong and more topic related so that the students wont get off topic. Another way the students could make the project more fun is making it more about them so they can be relax and want to the project . Thirdly, it helps the students practice more on projects if they design it their selves by doing this it teaches the students how to handle situation like this throughout life and they can over come that if they dont use help for a teacher or anyone. Also if they keep practicing how to make projects on their own they can help others in need of help making and thinking of ideas of how to make their project this is why know how to make project on your own helps out a lot. Making projects teaches you a lot about yourself you find out what you need help on and what your good at designing a project can be a lot of work but you can do it if you practice a lot if your doing them yourself. Practicing how to design project can be really helpful to you in so many ways and knowing how to make projects can help when your in school and needing to do a class project with other students that doesnt know how to make their own project. In summary, students designing their own projects will better them if they have to make another project on there own rather in school, work, or even summer projects. Without a teacher designing the project for the students they can get ideas of how to do it there selves in need of a time to make projects by them self. Also if teachers design a project for students the students might not like the summer project the teacher assigned for them to do and they wont do the project in that case they wont learn anything. Therfore students should be allowed to design their own projects without a teacher idea of how it should be designed and they can make it how they want to without the teachers opinion and they will want to do it.    ","Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME, I believe that school activities and sports are very important part of every day student life. If you take away these activities than it will negatively affect many students. These activities provide students with new learning experiences that are very important to some of these students. Taking them away will not help grades at all. At one point or another, almost every student has gone to one of these school activities or sports. Taking away these after school activities will affect the students in copious ways like there health. Many student s are in clubs after school so that they can easily hang out and have something to do. If they don't have something to do after school besides homework, and they probably won't study, they might try to do something extreme. There are many skateboarders in out school and most of them are in a club regulated by the school to make sure they don't do something too hard, without this guidance many will just try and do all the hardest tricks first. Also since the school does not have an eye on them they could be attacked. The crime rate is rapidly increasing meaning that our student are more likely to be attacked or commit crimes. On the news a while back there was a story of some kid whose school would not let him go to after school activities because he forgot his homework a couple of times. This made him outraged and every day he was bored. Later on that year he became angry with his teachers because he could not go back to after school activities. One of the local gangs then recruited him and his grades plummeted even more and he started to smash mailboxes and other crimes. When he was charged for these things he said that it was his school's fault because he could not go to the after school activities. If a student does poorly on his grades it should not mean that all of the after school activities should be stripped from them. There should be a compromise. Maybe instead of just getting there privileges just stripped from them they should get a warning. After getting a warning if there grades do start to improve they are free to go, but if they continue to drop they should have to go after school at least two times a day to study to get back into the clubs. This would help students improve there grades and get back there normal privileges. Principal TEACHER_NAME, please do not take away school activities and sports just because a student's grades drop. They should get a chance to redeem themselves. Also taking the activities right out from underneath them will leave them falling.",,,,,,,
164,104,"In the story the author gives us reasonable decisions on why we should go to Venus. It forms like earth and its clled the Earth? twin sister. The author provides a lot of information. One of them states ¨ may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered laregley with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life¨ this cold very well be a lot like earth. There are sea level just like earth and there ¨ familiar features such as valleys ,mountains,and craters.¨These areall the same thing that Earth has,It also says that this Venus could have very well had ocean covering all of it. The atricle states that they are going on missions and gettin machines to go and figure out why Venus is so much more life-like Earth. The nNAtional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is trying to do visits with humans to see if they can live there Becuase it states that ¨ iNot easy conditions, but it is survivable for humans¨which very well means that we can live there for a long period of time. They are doing so ich reasearch on this planet becuase they are worried of Earth very well not being here one day. This could go both wasy this could very well be a successful mission or it could be a very dangerous and unsure mission. That are traking research and countinuing finding more ways to make sure that humans will not have any problems while living in Venus. When they have everything solved they will send humans and see how their bodies will react to the way Venus makes them. Never know this ight be the next great discovery that NASA wil make happen and save all of us.    ","With summer break comes the joy of sleeping in and spending the day with friends, allowing students to be free from the stress that school may cause them. However, as students enjoy their freedom, they end up losing the knowledge they have carefully built up over the course of the school year. To combat this issue, some schools have implemented summer projects that students must complete over the course of their summer break. The issue with the mandatory summer projects is whether or not they should be designed by the students or by the teachers. Some may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial, but teacher-designed projects ensures that the project's purpose is fulfilled and that student can receive the help they need. While it can be said that creating the project would allow the students to retain the information better, there is no guarantee that the information itself would be accurate. Any student can make a worksheet or an assignment based on what they have learned, but few can do it correctly. If student-designed projects are done incorrectly, then the purpose of the project is completely disregarded; the entire point of the summer projects is to make sure students do not forget valuable information. Having teacher-designed projects is a safer and more reliable option. Teachers have studied the subject for years and have experience, meanwhile students are only just beginning to understand the concepts of the subject. Teachers must be able to determine whether or not what they are doing with their students is not superficial, but actually necessary and needed for the students. The projects designed by teachers provide a safety net for their students, while the projects designed by students would be a gamble. Though it is important that students are able to successfully work on their own, their ability to collaborate with peers and help one another is extremely beneficial for them. Making students design their own project is not only extremely stressful, it also isolates them from other students and from help. Teacher-designed projects would be uniform, meaning every students receives the same project. It would allow them to look to classmates for help if needed, or to even work together as a unit to get the project done. The collaboration would lessen the burden on the students and would also let them enjoy their summer break. Creating their own projects would quickly become overwhelming for students, especially if they have no one to turn to for support. Instead of focusing on the information like they are supposed to, the panicked students would focus only on finishing their assignment before it is due, thus defeating the purpose of the project. The main goal of summer projects is to provide students with a way to retain everything they have learned and to be prepared for their next school year, regardless of who creates the projects. To best achieve this goal, teachers should be the ones who design the projects. Teacher-designed projects would provide everything that students will need, as well as allow them breathing room during their well deserved break from school. Overall, teachers designing the projects would be a win-win for everyone involved. The students would feel confident and prepared, while the teachers would not have to worry about going over concepts from the year prior. At the end of the day, as long as the students feel comfortable and prideful of their work that was created by a teacher, then that is all that matters.","Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that requiring students to perform community service is not the right decision to make. We may have things that we have to do after school. Some kids would not have time to perform community service because we may have a lot of homework to do, have basketball practice and need to assist our parents with grocery shopping or babysitting. The students who actually have time to perform community service, should join. Those are the people who should be told to perform community service hours. The people who actually have nothing to do after school and are looking for things to do should be joiniingg the . Since they have free time and aren't participating in some school club or sport, then they should be apart of the community service. The others, like myself, are already participating in things, and it puts more of a burden on us having community service to do on top of sports, homework, and assisting your parents. My final decision is No, that you, our Principal, should not require students to perform community service because not all of us can do it, since we already involved in after school activities. If we did have to perform community service, then the we would be stressed and be lacking in all of our things because of all the things we have to do and I am sure that is not what you had in mind when you thought of this plan. After listening to my point of view, do you really think this idea is the best thing for the students of SCHOOL_NAME? Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle. To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself. Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't. Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call. That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own. In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   ","Do you want to do something you like? If so, then you should join the School's extracurricular activity.

We can't can't wait for you to join our activity! Once you have choosen an activity of your choice, you will never want to leave. There are so many things you can do, you may even make a new friend and get closer with that person. You can tell all your friends and people you know to join any activity they enjoy, give them a hand and help them choose an activity they like or you can tell them to join your activity. Make a person feel welcome, show them around, and show them what you like and tell them about it and ask them what they like, let them tell you about too. Have a great time, do want you wanna do, be kind to others, make a new friend. Overall we just want you to have a good time. Have fun, we all want the students to have fun and enjoy the activity they have choosen. Do something you like, and not because, someone tells you to do an activity you don't like. Make your own decsions and don't let anyone to force you to take something you don't like, yes you may tell that person to take this, but you can't force them. we really think that doing an activity a student likes will make them enjoy it and let them have a great time. we really want students to be more involed, that's why we think the school should have activity for students. We want students to just have fun and enjoy. Should students join an activity? Yes, because it will entertain them, and they learn a lot of new things, they will also make new firends. Doing something they will like and enjoy, will make them want to do the activity. Students should be able to do any activity they want and like. We just want to them to be entertained and learn more. ","The face on Mars, some people think it's an object created by aliens, others believe the face is just a natural landform. Many people think it was made by aliens because it looks similiar to a real person's face. Many other people think it's just a natural landform because aliens don't exist. The face on mars, is it an object made my aliens or just a natural landform? First of all, as myself being a NASA scientist, I believe it's a natural landform. I think it's a natural landform because there has been no evidence of life on Mars. NASA took a picture of the landform with a camera that can make the image three times bigger. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small rocks, you could see what they were""(11)! Also it could be a natural landform because in Idaho there is a natural landform that looks similair to the one on Mars. If it was an object made by aliens us scientist's at NASA would be able to know. On the other hand, many people think it's an object that was created by aliens. Many people think that because its so similair to a person's face. The face on Mars is located at a place where it is usualy cloudy, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze""(8). Skeptics think that NASA didn't see the aliens in the pictures because they were hidden in the fog or haze. They also think ""the FACE is bona fide evidence of life on Mars""(5). Also the face on Mars is a pop icon. When NASA released the pictures many people whent crazy about the face. ""It has starred in a Hollywold film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years""(5)! This shows us that people are excited and what to know about the face on Mars. In conclusion, we will never know if the face on Mars was created by aliens, or just a natural landform. There are many facts on why its not a landform made by aliens, but many peopole still believe it was made by aliens. Whatever the face is, it will always be something everyone will remember.","Mrs. Principal, I strongly disagree with the notion you are putting forth to change school policy and make it conform with your idea of limiting sports and other activities to students who have at least a B average. As you well know, many students have a C average. I am writing to you to propose three reasons why you should not put into practice this effect. For many students, P.E. and elective classes provide the only break they have through the entire eight-hour school day. If you do this, Mrs. Principal, you will be ridding the one thing that many of us look forward to. These classes give us a break from the monotony of doing nothing but class work. Thus, we become more tired, and score worse on our tests and quizzes. If you put this proposition into effect, you will be harming your school's appearance. So, actually, you will be harming yourself, Mrs. Principal. Physical education classes offer students the opportunity to show that they have something special. When students engage in team sports, they show character and good sportsmanship. Being in P.E. also can let a child explore their options in being fit. I also think that students do better when they can decide what kind of sports to play. Sports can give a child a better future, especially because they can receive a college scholarship for their ability to prove themselves in this field. Giving students their elective classes takes them beyond the realm of droll school work, and opens up a world of possibilities. Students can take Band, Guitar, and Piano, just to learn how to play instruments! And, also, isn't being technologically savvy an important thing in today's society? Having the choice to take keyboard and computer classes can enhance a students likeliness to succeed. As I mentioned before, these classes can take a burden off of students, and can make a day of quizzes seem like a day of fun! Having a good physical education class and elective can prove a student's worth. So, I implore you, Mrs. Principal, please don't make the change between our current policy and change it to the one in which you think is better. I believe that I speak for all the students when I say that we want to keep our P.E. class and electives. Please think about what you would be doing. Your student, STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,

In passge seven it also states that ""nasa has been working on studying venuse for such a long time that some of there electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber and have latsed for three weeks in such conditions"". scientiste have once said that venus was probably cover largely with oceans and could have suppoted human life now scientist have discover that the temperture around venus is more than 800 degrees which means sending humans to venus we wouldn't be able to survive it and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greter than what we experince on earth. venus also has simlail things comparing to earth it has rocky sediment, mountains and craters. ","Schools assigning summer projects is a smart idea, considering most high school kids spend summer eating junk food, staying out late with friends, and then sleeping most of the day. During the summer most students have fun and dont do any school work which leaves them feeling behind and dumb when they return the next school year. Giving students the opportunity for student-designed projects does teach responsibility and freedom, however teacher-designed projects presents students with the content they need to know, its more unified, and more stuctured. Teachers know what content students are supposted to learn throughout the school year, so they should present that content through the summer projects. This would help students gain the knowledge that kids need to aquire. A A good example is how this year at Generic_School, administration has desided to try peronal learning, personal learning means teachers are not supposted to directly teach which requires students to do projects and independent work to teach themselves. This change is new at Generic_School, but so far the outcome is not benfical for students learning. Students cant just do random projects on topics they are interesterd in learning about, that doesnt lead to being successful in gaining knowledge. Teachers should give out projects in order for kids have some kind of guide lines to follow, helping them learn what they need to know. Not only would teachers presenting the correct content help kids learn, it would also make it more unified. All the students in a class should be presented with the same material, although everyone learns at different speeds, this would make it more fair. If everyone in the class got the same concept to learn and do a project on people could work togeather. Me and my friend Generic_Name do this a lot when we have the same assignment for a class we will hang out and get our work done, its very helpful working with her or other people and getting different perspectives or ideas. Rather than every student picking a different topic and learning about something unordinary like frog eggs, which isnt a necessity to know in life. If projects are given by teachers and everyone gets the same task its more unified and kids can learn while working with eachother, team work is a important life skill everyone has to learn. Being a unified class is as equally helpful with learning as being structured. At my school we use online resources such as google classroom which is structured assignments that teachers post, it also help students stay on task. Structure is connected to orginization, it is proven that lack of orginization can cause students to fall behind with school. Most kids are not organized, students lose supplies and stuff all the time like its a teenager thing. Teachers are unually more organized, which proves they should be responible for giving the summer projects. Without structure from teachers students will do whatever they want like pick the simplist topic to do a project on. During the school year most schools have teacher-designed projects and teachers actually teach what students are required to learn. Teachers create plans for their everyday classes, based off the content the state tells them students need to be taught. So why would teachers not continue doing what they have all year and just give out summer teacher-designed projects?","Dear Principal, I believe that students should be required to participate in some community service. I support my idea of having students participate in community service with evidence from my life. In my life i think that i have done over 100 hours of community service. First of all, I have been a helper and a actor in a play at my church for a week of the summer. This experience changed me and made me a better person. If we had students participate in community service we may be able to change how some people live. We may be able to get them to change there ways and stay out of trouble. If we required ever student to have a said amount of community service hours than they would have something to do with their time so they could stay out of predicaments that they should have not be in, in the first place Another example from my life is the time i spend being a teachers assistant at SCHOOL_NAME, a Japanese summer school program. I started this program when i was in the 2nd grade. Naturally when i was younger I had always wanted to be come a teachers assistant. This program takes 5 hours of my day, for three weeks, Monday through Friday. This has saved me from getting in a lot of trouble. From the example in my life i clearly stated why we should require a certain amount of community service hours for our students. First, it can make the teens better people. Second, it can change the way people live and treat others. And finally, the teens will have a better chance of not getting in trouble because most of the day will be filled with extra activities.","A large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. A lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone. In America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied. In 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash. A lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones. In conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone. There is just too much at risk to be driving distracted.   ","Students should have control over at least a few things in school. From maybe what club they want to be in, or what sport they want to play. That should all be the students choice, but what if they dont want to join something like that? They shouldn't need to if they don't want to. So why should we be forced to join a sport, club, or school activity that we dont feel comfortable in. We should work the hardest that we can in school, so if some students can handle another activity then they should pick it up, but if the student can't handle it, it might add stress to what is already a stressful place. Overall, I disagree that it should mandatory to have a extracurricular activity. Stress can be very hard on a student, with all the school work and pounding from teachers and parents to do well in school, it can be hard. Some students can handle it better than others, and some can hardly handle the stress they already have, so adding another stressful activity on them could hurt their grade. Not only can stress come from the activity its self, but having to pick on in a limited amount of time can be very stressful if not more. The majority of students try their best in school to get good grades and to get into a good college, so at the moment, its way better to focus on school right now. If the student can focus on school and the activity, then thats their choice to do both. While yes, the students do get to choose what activity they want to do, what if none of the activities interest them? What if they want to focus on school and not do that. They should be given the choice whether they want to or not. At school, we dont have much control over things, and this is an example of something that was need to be in control of, why should this be mandatory? If we dont want to do an activity and focus on school work instead, then we should have the choice if we want to or not. We as students need to take charge and focus on what is important in school, grades. With making these activities mandatory, you are taking away some of the students after school work time, or during school work time. Now once again, if it was a choice, then it would be relatively OK, if the student has the time, they should be able to do it. But focusing on school is very important for not only now, but for the future as well. For students, the grades the grades they get now can be very important. A students time is very valuable and should not be completely wasted on activities that serve no use to them. When grades are at play here, it could be what drags them down. The students of today can be and are very important, they are the future and what will lead us into what can be. Wasting time on things that could bring them down should not be something mandatory. ","In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the ""Face on Mars."" It is a natural landformation and is visible becuase of the pictures shown, the internet, and the area the landform is located. First, the pictures show the ""face."" In 1976, the pixels were 43m (meters) per pixel. In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels. In 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the ""face"" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side. Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform. In the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet. Finally, where the ""face"" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. In the article, it states that ""The sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Although the NASA researchers have concluded the ""face"" to be a natural landform, many are not satisfied with it. Many people claim that it was built by aliens, however, pictures do not lie. In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is really a mystery. Many think it is a natural landform while others think that it was built for a reason by aliens. The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landformation becuase of the pictures presented, the Internet, and the location on the landform.   ","Principal: Being a student at our school, I think that it is a wise decision that you have made to only allow students with a B average or above to participate in sports or other such activities. Here are the reasons: students will have to work harder in school, they will get rewarded for their efforts, be more conscientious students, and therefore be able to better contribute to your school. Students that have good grades are the ones that coaches want for their teams. I have learned this personally and think that if you are a student with good grades you are more likely to work harder in their sport or other activities as well. Getting a B average may not be easy for all of these students, but if they truly want to play the sport or do the activity they will want to put in the effort to get the grades needed to participate. If students get a B average it is more likely that they will excel in their extracurricular areas, because it will be rewarding after getting good grades. Playing on sports teams has shown me that the kids who are willing to work hard at school are also willing to work hard in their sport or other talent area that they may have. This is another reason that implementing this rule is a good idea. The school will also benefit from this change by having more conscientious students in its walls. If students have to be pushed mentally, they will be more willing to be pushed physically. I think that having better students will also translate into better athletes and kids in other activities. In closing, I would just like to say that I agree whole-heartedly with your decision to only let students with a B average or higher participate in sports or other activities. As shown throughout this letter, I think that our school will benefit greatly from this and will grow not only academically, but in our other areas. I hope that other schools will follow our lead and raise the standard for grades in schools nationwide. Your conscientious student: STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
164,728,"Venus, the second planet from the sun, and one of the most dangerous planets for exploration. The planet is strangly reffered to ""Earth's twin"", today it might not hold Earth's qualities, but long ago it was beilieved it did. Scientist's are set to beileve that at one point Venus had oceans and a possinble life sorce. A time before the extreme weather conditions, Venus is said to have flourished with oceans, supporting various forms of life, like Earth today. Now, that is long gone, taken over by a volcanic terrain. Exploring Venus will be dangerous and worth all the odds against it. We, as humans, have already tried to explore the dangerous planet before. Each mission has been unmanned as no spacecraft has even survived the landing for more than a few hours. Nasa is now working on other approaches to studying Venus. One project being conducted states ""having simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" That will allow us to have a better understanding of limiting the exteme factors. Looking back to mechanial computers, will be easiter as it is more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Exploration of Venus would contribute emensally to our knowlendge of our sister planet. The author states ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors."" Through our curiosity, it will allow us to aquire insight into a new vast world, far beyond our exploration on Earth. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Space exploration has no limit, bounderies will inspire those to explore the unexplored and will allow us to push oursleves to places we have never been before. Venus, an inhospitable planet, with extreme temperatures ranging up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, to the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater than on Earth. It may seem obsurd to even consider the possibility of even exploring the planet itself, but motivation and some inspiration it will take you to great places. Scientists today, are finding ways to get us their safely and effectivally. To building a possible hover craft to working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to require meaningful data. There are a lot of factors to be put into consideration when thought about, but with the right tools and knowledge one day exploring Venus might be a possiblity. ","At last it's summer time! I can sleep in everyday and do whatever I please. However, I still have to consider the unpleasant thought of finishing my summer assignments before the end of summer vacation. Although some may say otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students the opportunity to choose the material they want to learn and it will motivate students to complete the projects on time rather than wait until the end of the summer. First of all, school projects should be student-designed because it gives the students the opportunity to choose the material they want to learn which will make the projects more interesting since they will be geared towards their interests. For instance, when I was in 10th grade at Generic_School, I was assigned a project along with a group of students in my AP World History class where we were to research any period of history and make a PowerPoint presentation to present to the class. As a group, we agreed on choosing the Great Depression because we all had a decent amount of background knowledge about the specific topic. Therefore, each group member could contribute their views and researched information to the presentation, meaning there wasn't one member who didn't participate in the project. Furthermore, another instance would be when my sister, Generic_Name, was assigned a project in her orchestra class at Generic_School where she was given the project to find a song online and play it for the class. The thought of choosing her own song brought her so much joy since she could choose a song by some of her favorite artists: Owl City, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry. She decided on choosing the song Blank Space by Taylor Swift becuase it wouldn't be too challenging or to easy for her to play. Each day, leading up to the due date, she practiced for at least an hour so she could play for the class without any mistakes. Generic_Name forgot that she was doing a school project because of how much fun she was having playing the song. Projects don't have to be something to dread completing when they can be easily geared towards the students interests, leading to substantial success in the end. Additionally, school projects should be student-designed because it movivates students to complete their work on time rather than wait until the end of the summer to tackle the assignments, which will overall boost their performance. For example, In the summer of 2019, I was assiged to read at least one book and prepare to talk about it the next school year. Rather than having to read some random book picked by the school or county, I was able to choose a book that I would actually read for the purpose of entertainment, in contrast to just reading it because it was required. I chose to the novel, IT, by Stephen King because I enjoy the horror genre and he happens to be one of the most well known horrer fiction writers. I started out reading the book during the first week of summer with no major thoughts, that was until I realized I had been reading for two hours, wanting to read more and more. I became intrigued by the story and wanted to know what would come next. After only a week, I managed to finish the novel, the time flew by so fast because I was genuinly having a good time reading which rarely happens. Another example is when the Korean singer, Generic_Name, on the Korean surivial show known as Produce 101, was given the task during the first week of the competition to choose a dance for her assigned idol group. After congregating with her group, Generic_Name had her mind set on the dance to the song Into The New World by Girls Generation. The song fit perfectly with the group in a sense that the choreography was not too advanced for each of the members to learn, but it still looked smooth and well put together when done well. When the day of the dance battle came, Generic_Name and her group danced to the best of their ability, putting a lot of emotion and hard work into the dance. As a result, her group came in first place which meant that every member in the group was saved from elimination that was to take place that week. When people are given the the task that involves an interest of theirs, they will be likely to excell at that task. Some may say that when students are given the opportunity to choose what they want to learn, they will take advatage of that and pick something easy or irrelevant to learn. While understandable, that reasoning is flawwed due to the fact that teachers monitor students work in order to keep them on track. For instance, when I was in 7th grade at Generic_School, I chose a topic for my science project that went beyond the realm of 7th grade science. As a result, my teacher, Generic_Name, geared my in the correct direction by giving me a list of topics to choose from that correlated to the currect unit we were learing about. Some may also say that students get discouraged by the thought of summer projects in general, meaning they won't want to work on them at any cost. While understandable, that reasoning is flawed because when students are given the chance to choose something they feel strongly passionate about, they will be far more likely to work towards completing the project. For instance, when my friend, Generic_Name, was given the initiative to find statistics in his AP Statistics class at Generic_School, he chose to research statistics about his favorite game called League of Legends that included the number of people in each country When given the chance, students can surely succeed and learn a lot of information when the school projects are student-designed. In our society, school work and school activities are predominately controlled by the administration such as teachers and staff, but students have just as equal ideas as everyone else about school work and can possibly better the education system by making school more enjoyable for students all around the world.","Dear Principal, I do not think that community service should be mandatory because unless someone is jailed or imprisoned, even the law can't force them to do community service. I think it is unfair to force students to do community service because it is their decision to make. I am not saying that community service is bad. Actually, I think that I should do it more often. But you have to give the students a chance to make their own decisions as what to do for extracurricular activities. Imagine if every year, you were assigned an extracurricular activity. No fun in choosing it! Students should be able to choose what they want to do outside of school hours and off of the school grounds. Another problem with this idea of community service is that it could take away from valuable family time and other activities, such as sports, parties, and even just taking a day and doing nothing. Students have less free time than ever nowadays. Are you saying that you want them to have even less free time? Preposterous! I know that I sound a little vehement, but I think community service is a great idea. Maybe you could have a community service volunteer extracurricular activity. Speaking from a student's perspective, the best thing you could do to lower morale around SCHOOL_NAME Middle School is force the students to do something that they don't want to do. I agree that a volunteer-based community service extracurricular activity would be very good, and I might even take part in it. But you already send us to school for 7 hours a day. Do you have to take away our free time, too? I stand completely and vehemently opposed to a forced community service activity for many reasons. Most of the students wouldn't try at all with the community service. Imagine a bored eighth grader that has to read to a group of cute little kindergartners. The student puts no effort into it and comes across as unmotivated and stupid. Now that would be a great way to lower your school's reputation. Mandatory community service is just a bad idea all the way around the whole wheel. The kids wouldn't even have their heart in it. It would lower the morale around the school. Even some teachers are probably opposed to the idea of mandatory community service, and they would be unhappy. Your school's reputation would go down. You would take away the students' free time. You would take away their sports. Their activities. Their time with friends. Their time to do homework (don't you want them to do that?) . Their time to explore their passion and find things out about themselves. Their time to do anything. So, please, I beg you, I implore you to not make community service mandatory for all the students in the school.","People who drive while texting or on a call put themselves and others in danger while being distracted by the phones. It is very dangerous and irresponsible for people to be on their phones while driving. It always causes and accident which leads to death, laws being broken and innocent people having to suffer the consequences of others. Texting while driving will always be dangerous to everyone involved making it a hazard to anyone. When people start to text or call their focus starts to drift away from driving and keeping an eye on the road. When driving you must keep focus on the road and making sure you do not run into anything or anyone. But once you start to text someone else or talking on the phone you start to become more involved with the phone instead of the road. That is when accidents start to accrue and people begin to get hurt. Many people have been victims of people who are on the phone texting instead of watching where they were driving. There has been Multiple of people, families who have been hurt or even killed due to people texting while driving. Not only do the people who get hit get hurt most drives also die as well in the accident because it was so intense and horrible. This is such a huge cause of why it is so dangerous to use your phones while driving. It takes so much risk to do it because ne second you could just be sending one little text then in less than a second your about to drive into oncoming traffic. Many people who are just walking the streets or driving home suffer due to people on their phones while having one eye on the road. Because there have been so many incidents where people get hurt due to texting while driving that laws have and still being made to stop this. Many states one by one have all agreed that people on their phones while driving must come to an end. Laws are said that it is not allowed to use your phone while driving. The consequence or doing this can lead people to be pulled over and even arrested. There is still a good amount of states that still let you use your phones while driving but, the increase of the laws of being made for that is going up fast. There has just been so many problems and accidents that people and the states are starting to really make a change with those laws. It is taken very seriously due to so many people taking action and protesting this being put to creation. Not listing to the states that have up that law can cause major problems for people. It is a very serious issue that is trying to be controlled and stopped. Even though people do die every day due to problem there are some who do live but affected by it for the rest of their lives. When some people are hit by a car it may not kill them but it may permanently damage their bodies. Many people have been left to use a wheelchair the rest of their lives because of the car crash. There have been cases that some victims have been left in comas because of how hard the car hit them. These are all the causes of what could and what have happened to people who have been a victim of people driving while on the phone. Plus, the families and friends that have to deal with the loss of a loved one. Everyone gets hurt that is involved with this kind of accident. It affects everyone you do not have to dead for that. It kills people it leaves people broken, and it just leads to pain. All of this is due to people using their phones when they are supposed to be focused driving looking at what is in front of them. All of these reasons are why people support the laws saying people should not use their phones while driving. It is beyond dangerous for everyone, it should not be allowed and should be stopped. It affects everyone whether you are the driver or the victim or even the family. It hurts everyone involved and that is why there are many laws being made to stop any more accidents to happen. Using your phone while driving will never be safe no matter what someone does or says. It is always going to put yourself and other in harm ways.                                           ","Did you know that Generic_Name has decided that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity? Isn't that great? Well unfortunately most students don't think so. Believe it or not most kids would rather sit at home and watch TV or play Minecraft rather than take such a great opportunity to participate in something new. I agree with this new decision, that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular though, because students will have a chance to involve themselves in a community, they will get to expand they're horizons and learn new things, and transportation won't be inconvenient for parents. To start with, students will get to involve themselves in something other than social media and school. Most students don't spend their time doing much more than eating, sleeping, coming to school, doing homework, posting something, eating, and scrolling through they're feed again. Obviously this is an unhealthy routine to keep, especially for young growing minds who need to be more engaged. Therefore participating in something else in addition to your daily life will be highly beneficial. Students will then not only participate in something more healthy but they will also become part of a community. Being a part of a community can be healthy and fun. You gain support and encouragement in a safe environment and meet new people. Granted meeting new people and making new friends one should find no trouble doing. When you join something new you meet new people with similar interests, and having similar interests you have a common ground to start a new friendship easily! Joining a club or participating in an extra curricular activity is wonderful because you can detach from your phone and other work for a while and enjoy being part of a community and making new friends. Another great part of participating in something new is learning something new. Doing something different is a great way to learn new things. As you expand you area's of interest you also expand your skill set. One of the most important things you can learn while in a community is communication. Communication is extremely important in your daily life whether it's with your friends, family, teachers, employees, your boss, or the nice man who lives two houses down from you. Communication is needed and used everywhere. One can also learn many other important life skills. Let's say you decide to join a sport, you begin learning team building skills, or maybe you serve on the student council, you learn leadership and how to be a good role model. These are great life skills. It's good to learn new life skills such as these and expand your horizons at a young age to later assist you in life. However as great as this all is parents are still unsure about the new rule, as they have concerns about transportation. Most adults work late, with inflexible hours and have no way to arrange a ride for their child. Well rest assured parents, there is no reason to worry because the school provides your child safe transportation for when he or she is done. Schools have late buses to account for those who stay after school to participate in an extra curricular activity. Parents have no reason to fret as the school has them completely covered as they provide late buses so we can all get home safely and our hard working parents can relax. So although it may seem a problem, parents should absolutely not have to worry about transportation, for the school has made transportation easy thanks to late buses. Generic_Name's new decision is one i strongly agree with, because students will involve themselves in a community, while learning new things, and transportation is made easy for parents as well. Everyone should try something new and grab this opportunity to achieve all the great things I mentioned. After hearing my position I would hope more students will follow this new rule with an open mind and enjoy expanding they're horizons as much as I will! ","The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth. Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure. Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say. ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more. A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example. ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth. Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars. It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""","School sports have always been very important, to both the students and the school. They have been played for decades and are very entertaining to watch. It helps show pride in your school, but is that really what the purpose of school is about? Most students would argue against this policy but I think that it is the right thing to do. There are many reasons why students with below a B average should not participate in school sports. First, if they have below a B average that means that they are struggling so instead of playing sports they should be studying and by playing school sports that enables them to do that. Also the purpose of school is to learn. Kids can play sports outside of school but school should not be about sports. And lastly many kids play school sports because they believe that they will prosper to become something better. But realistically the chances of going pro or even playing in college sports are very slim. Almost everyone will make their living off of what they learned in school and many students need to understand that. Overall students should not participate in school sports with under a B average. Many people may argue that they have the right to do whatever they want and I condemn that. But not when it comes to school. School is a place to learn and students with under a B average should be out trying to raise that grade. I hope by reading this that you will realize that this is the right thing to do, no matter how many critics there may be.",,,,,,,

In this eassy I would give resonse and explancions as in why the another things we should keep exploroing Venus. One of the resons the author suggests that we keep studing Venus because its closer to Earth. Sence Venus is closer to Earth the scientists belive that there could be life on Venus. In paragrahp 4 the text states that "" long ago, Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth"". Now in days scientists say that the planet still has some familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. Another reson why the author things we should keep studing Venus is because, he belives that maybe someday Venus cand be our nearest option for planetary visit .The text states that "" Futhermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time farmes of space travel"". This shows that maybe someday the scientists will find a to be able to live in Venus. Many people are trying to make machines that can last on Venus to help find discover more about it. Acorrding to the artical""NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. For ezample some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surfawce and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions"". They are also looking back at old technology called mechanical computers. In conclusion this shows that ev even tho it maybe dagers sicentists are still trying to finger out ways to go and explor more abot Venus without so much danger.","As the school year approaches, students begin to turn their attention towards the daunting task of summer assignments. Teachers give assignments to their future students, whether it be books to read or projects to complete. These are designed to ensure that the students don't forget everything they learned in the previous year during summer. These summer projects should be student designed because students would be more motivated, students would know what they are doing more, and teachers could get an idea of what the student is like before the school year completely starts. It is not uncommon for students to not want to do a project that their teacher assigned them, and the fact that this project is during their precious summer break doesn't make it any better. A student might not try as hard on this assignment, or maybe even not do it, which defeats the purpose of a summer project. But if a student were to create their own assignment, that student would be much more motivated to complete the task. For example, if a teacher told their students to read a book and write a report on it, it likely wouldn't appeal to those who have to read the book. But if the student were to choose what project they wanted to do after reading the book, they could pick something they enjoy doing, and therefore the assignment would be much more productive. Before students meet their teacher at the beginning of the year, they are left with he inability to ask questions about the projects assigned to them over summer. This means that if the teachers give vague instructions, or the a student generally doesn't understand the assigned task, they best they can do is try to email their teacher and hope for a response. But, if a student picked their own project, they would definitely pick something that they know they understand and can do. For example, if a teacher tell their students to read a book and create a diorama, the students won't know what they need to create a diorama of. Now, a student given the same book but told to pick their own project would choose an activity based on the book that they know how to do, which would allow them to better complete the assignment. Summer projects are the first way a teacher gets to know what a student is like. If every one of the teacher's students is assigned the same exact project, they likely won't be able to tell much about the student. But, if a student is able to pick their own assignment, the teacher can begin to get an idea of how that student learns. For example, if the students are told to read a book but are allowed to choose their own projects, one student might choose to rewrite a scene of the book form a different perspective. This could tell the teacher that this student is a good reader and writer who understands the text they are given. Another student could choose to make a three dimensional model of something significant in the book, telling the teacher they are more creative and visual. This allows teachers to start to know their students. It goes without saying that the typical student wants to eliminate summer assignments altogether to have a responsibility-free summer, but a student-designed summer assignment is the next best thing. It allows the assignment to still get done, while letting students show thier teachers what they like to do, along with keeping them motivated and understanding the project.","Dear Principal, I think community service is very important and it helps us appreciate what we have and to be considerate of those who have less than us. It can be fun to do with friends and family I think we should consider this as a wonderful opportunity to bond with friends and family and to help the less fortunate/ community in the process. It helps bring a sense of unity amongst us young people and I think that it is just fun to make people smile and to make the world a better place in the process. And for the people that think community service is a waste of time or it takes time away from their studies, maybe you could add some extra study halls into their courses. Or, you find a way to make community service more appealing in some way. So that every one will want to do it, and not feel forced into it. If that doesn't work, you can tell them it always looks good on future applications. From tutors to trash cans, it always benefits the community in some way. So you really can't go wrong with service. Please take into consideration what i have said. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME","In today's day and age, as technology grows more and more sophisticated, the likelihood of someone owning both a car and a cellphone gets higher as the years progress, cell phones can be used for just about everything such as texting, talking, playing games, and such forth. Sadly, people are choosing to be on their phones while they are driving. Not only is this decision incredibly dull, for you could injure yourself but others as well, but there are many reasons why using a cell phone while driving is dangerous, One of the biggest reasons why using your cellphone while driving is dangerous is that texting and driving not only puts you in danger but will put all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. Did you know ""that an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council? The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year""(Center and Statistics, 2020) in Georgia alone. Texting and driving make you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident. Also, ""texting while driving will delay your reaction time more than when you are under the influence"" (Center and Statistics, 2020) If you simply cannot resist the urge to check your text messages (or to simply be on your phone) while driving, take the time to pull off of the roadway and park your vehicle before picking up your cell phone. Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Quality essays will consist of an introduction, thesis statement, distinct body paragraphs, smooth transitions, and a sound conclusion. Adhere to the standards of formal English - free of grammar and mechanical errors (proofread well). Finally, be certain that the writing is entirely your own words.         ","The principal just announced a new school rule. The rule says that every student has to participate in at least on after school activity. To some people, this is a great idea. To other, it might not sound too great. In this paper, I will tell you my side on this new rule. Afterwards, I will try to convince you why you should support my claims. First of all, I should let you know which side I'm on. Whether I support the new rule or not. To be brief , I do support this new rule. The principal took a risk with this. The risk he took is the reaction of the parents and the teachers. Even with all of that though, in the long run, this rule will pay off. In this paragraph, I will be stating different factors, pros, opinions, and more. Everything I state is to convince you to support my side of this new rule. First of all, the extracurricular activities can make students happier when they choose an activity they love. This can motivate them to work better and harder in and out of school. Secondly, it will push students to be well-rounded. Third of all, it can push kids to do their very best. The coaches, helpers, and other adults in the students' life will push them and have them strive to be great. Going off of my last paragraph, I will continue listing ways that the new rule is a good thing. The difference is that I will be talking about mostly the parent benefits. First of all, when kids are at their activities, the parents have more time to relax and not worry as much. Also, if every single student is at an activity, then more people can set up carpools. In addition to what I said before, about the student being happier and doing better in school, they can have better behavior and attitude at home. The kids will be happier all around, which can make the parent happier. Some parents may be concerned on how their child will juggle having the activity going on and also maintaining good grades. Eventually, the kid will learn to handle it. This teaches them responsibility. This skill can be used at school, home, and anywhere! In conclusion, that is my paper. I talked about how the principal introduced a new school rule that every student has to do an extracurricular activity. I talked about how I was all for that rule and the benefits that came with it. How the coaches and other adults can encourage the kids and help them strive for greatness. Also how the activities can teach them responsibility, and make them have better behavior and attitude. I hope by reading this I convinced you to accept and support the new rule. The reason is, in my opinion, the extracurricular activities make the students all around happier people. ","Being a scientist at NASA is very hard because you have to make sure that you are correct when talking about something important such as the Face. Many people like to make theories about subjects but nobody knows about the real information. Not unless we share it to the public, we will not share things we want to hide from everyone. The picture was not made by aliens and we explain why it is just a natural landform. If I were to be a scientist at NASA I would tell the person that the Face is just a natural landform. There are many conspiracy theorists that claim we are trying to hide something, such as saying aliens made the Face. In the article it says "" evidence that NASA would rather hide "" , that is correct. If the aliens did make it then we wouldn't have showed the public the photos. We would want to keep it out of newspapers, magazine, tv shows, and movies. NASA would also never want lots of people to see the picture of the Face if they were to hid something. We would make the picture an enigma to the citizens of the world. Scientist in NASA have studied these for years and they have all the information. Also in the third paragraph in the article it tells us that there are some shadows that make the the Face get the illusion of having eyes and a nose. The third paragraph says "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. "" which is telling us that they want people to know more about Mars so we obvisouly wouldn't be showing the pictures if the aliens made it. Although there were few scientist that believed the Face was an alien artifact, in paragraph seven it says "" ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. "" , NASA scientist take their jobs very serious. People continued to say the Face markings were made from aliens but the NASA scientist said it was just a natural landform and some of the pictures were made from the shadows. On April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer in Cydonia, Malin's team got an "" extraordinary "" picture of the Face because many people such as the theorists said maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze. In the second paragraph NASA was excited to see if the Face was something sensational and the article says "" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. "" the only thing that made this one stand out was it has shadows that give it facial features such as a nose, eyes and a mouth. NASA soon showed the picture for all the people to see with a caption telling them what it was. NASA would not show the picture and make up something if the Face was really created by aliens. In the very last paragraph the article tells us what the picture actually shows from what the scientist at NASA have gathered. Paragraph twelve says "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. "". The scientist are telling us that the Face is just a landform, as a NASA scientist there is a lot of information about the Face and it was not made by aliens. NASA has got many photos of the Face and have also commented about what made it look like this. ","Mrs. Principal, I strongly disagree with the notion you are putting forth to change school policy and make it conform with your idea of limiting sports and other activities to students who have at least a B average. As you well know, many students have a C average. I am writing to you to propose three reasons why you should not put into practice this effect. For many students, P.E. and elective classes provide the only break they have through the entire eight-hour school day. If you do this, Mrs. Principal, you will be ridding the one thing that many of us look forward to. These classes give us a break from the monotony of doing nothing but class work. Thus, we become more tired, and score worse on our tests and quizzes. If you put this proposition into effect, you will be harming your school's appearance. So, actually, you will be harming yourself, Mrs. Principal. Physical education classes offer students the opportunity to show that they have something special. When students engage in team sports, they show character and good sportsmanship. Being in P.E. also can let a child explore their options in being fit. I also think that students do better when they can decide what kind of sports to play. Sports can give a child a better future, especially because they can receive a college scholarship for their ability to prove themselves in this field. Giving students their elective classes takes them beyond the realm of droll school work, and opens up a world of possibilities. Students can take Band, Guitar, and Piano, just to learn how to play instruments! And, also, isn't being technologically savvy an important thing in today's society? Having the choice to take keyboard and computer classes can enhance a students likeliness to succeed. As I mentioned before, these classes can take a burden off of students, and can make a day of quizzes seem like a day of fun! Having a good physical education class and elective can prove a student's worth. So, I implore you, Mrs. Principal, please don't make the change between our current policy and change it to the one in which you think is better. I believe that I speak for all the students when I say that we want to keep our P.E. class and electives. Please think about what you would be doing. Your student, STUDENT_NAME",,,,,,,
