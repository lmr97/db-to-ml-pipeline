No, the principal's new rule that makes students participate in at least one extra curricular activity is ridiculous. First of all, for many students it is not in their budget to stay after school, they just can not afford it. Second is, a lot of students have responsibilities or struggles at home they have to take care of, and can not simply stay after school, even if it is just for an hour. The principle should rethink his decisions and not make this a rule at our school.¶¶Many students at our school aren't as fortunate as others, and struggle to make ends meet. Their only rides to and from school could be the school bus because their families don't have a good car, so they would have to go through finding someone else to drive them, which can be very difficult sometimes. For the kids whose families do have cars, that could mean that their parents have to take time of of work to pick up and drive home their kids. The more time their parents have to take off work to pick up them from clubs and sports, the less money they could have the opportunity to make for their family.¶¶Some students attending our school have things that are out of their control that they need to get done right after school, like homework. Other students have family struggles outside of school, such as their parents being split up and then having to rely on only one parent to take care of them at that specific time. When a student only has one parent taking care of them at a specific time, they may not have a choice but to go home after school on the bus because the parent taking care of them has be at work at that time. Some students may also have a lot of homework that they can not get done if they go to a club or sport after school. The principal did not make it clear about if club sports counted as an extracurricular activities. Many students participate in club sports, and if they are made to stay after school in a school club, they could miss a practice or game. Students might also have a long list of chores to do when they get home and a club could get in the way of that.¶¶So should students be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity? No, they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. If they get forced to participate in an extracurricular activity their normal, everyday lives could be disrupted, and some students just can not do a club or sport at all due to things happening at home. If we put this rule into place, the school would quickly turn into a disaster of confused and upset kids.","The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college.¶¶Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest.¶¶concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they don't put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers.¶¶according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes.¶¶concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ","Vehicles and Phones¶¶In 2018 there were 4,637 deaths caused by distracted drivers. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, it increases the risk of accidents, causes deaths, and overall the act is irresponsible.¶¶Well, Iets say you're going out of town and you need to use the gps? Most cars nowadays use modern technology, and there's a thing called Bluetooth. Having the option of Bluetooth in a vehicle allows a phone to connect to a car wirelessly. Which would ultimately allow distraction-free gps. Cell phones are helpful, but can be highly unsafe, while operating a vehicle.¶¶Is Bluetooth actually any safer? Setting up Bluetooth can be as easy as one, two, three. Look for your cars manual and it should have directions on how to set up bluetooth from your phone to your car. I believe bluetooth is safer because you would be allowed to have hands free control over your phone. This essentially removes the problem of operating your phone while driving. You will only have to set up bluetooth once, so once your phone is paired there is no undoing it unless you please.¶¶In conclusion, I don't think people should be allowed to use cell phones in their vehicle to any extent if it's unavoidable. People who do so not only are putting themselves at risk but other people's lives as well. Bluetooth is a great alternative to minimize the use of cell phones while operating vehicles. Most cars nowadays have this option. For people who don't have this option, i advise that you not only think about yourself, but as well as other people, when using your cell phone while driving.   ","Principle,¶¶I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school at lunch time but if you have them out during class you'll receive the normal punishment. What would be the point of not allowing students to have they're cell phones out during lunch? They are eating and/or talking to friends.¶¶Although, the only true downside to this is if your texting it does not always get to the other persons phone right away, depending on the amount of signal you or they have it could take 5 seconds or it could take 30 minutes. And because of that the students cell phone could ring in the middle of class and end up having them in detention with they're phone taken away.¶¶So as you can see in the first two paragraphs that there is a good thing and a bad thing about allowing students to have there cell phones out during school hours, or at least class room time, and with that being said why can't we also have our cell phones out during school dances, it would not be very different from lunch time and your after school. The only problem i can see by allowing this is if you drop your phone, leave it somewhere, or its been stolen.¶¶These things are not very big things to worry about but some of these things don't really have a complete point to, like the one for school dances in the last paragraph, it doesn't really have a reason why we can not have them out. Truly there has to be a really good explanation for not allowing this.¶¶Now for not allowing them in class I understand, the way I see it is because students will, most likely, most of their time texting or calling friends or family about what they are going to do after school. If this is allowed the this will probably happen, the students will not pay attention, they will not learn, won't get their homework finished, they might get held back a grade, not graduate, not go to college, won't get a very good job (that they actually like to do), from then on their are a few more problems and all because the school allowed cell phones in class, but that doesn't mean that this will happen to everyone some will actually want to pay attention, finish homework on time, and so on. But luckily schools don't allow phones out whenever the student wants to text his/her friend but maybe at lunch or at school dances.¶¶Now throughout this response i have said/typed what I think is, in a way, best for the school and that is to carry out with the no cell phones in school policy. Because the student might lose his/her cell phone or other electronic device.                  ","Dear principal,¶¶As you may know not many of us students like the idea of you wanting to change the schools policy were we can not play any sports unless we work harder to have at least a B average. I like your idea a lot and think its great that you want to do that. The reason why is because it will be a good way to get the students to want to do better in school. Most kids just play around and think that school is a joke when truly its not. The kids that really like to play the sports should want to try and get the good grades to play the sports. I truly think and believe in that. It is just that easy to keep the sport if you just do your best to keep in it. I would love for you to do the best you can to make that change. It will make our school a better environment. What would i do without the coolest principal here at this school. The students need to realize how important this opportunity is. They should learn to appreciate the fact that you are trying to do something good for our school. These students here don't understand how important it is. I just wish that the students will start agreeing with the change and start making better grades to make their parents happier. If they think about it, it will be better if we achieve that goal. Its really not that hard to do so.¶¶I achieved my goals by making myself move forward and participate in the game. Like they say on ""High School Musical.""¶¶""You have to think right and break left keep your head on with what we do to day cause help is on the way."" That capture helped me to remember that without my team I would not have made it , and won that game. I love your wonderful ideas and hope you think of some more great ones.¶¶sincerely yours,¶¶STUDENT_NAME      ","Studying Venus is a worthy pursuite all the dangers it presents.

","The Electoral College should get changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United State. Because the voter's vote are not for the presidents, instead they are actually for the slate electors. Which then go and vote for the president. Which isnt fair becuase for all we know, the state legislatures choose the electors that could go againts the will of people. Also because of the ""winner take all system in each state.""¶¶First of all the voter's votes aren't voting ofr the president, they are technally voteing for the slate electors. For example, you think you voted for the president. when actually you hav voted for 34 electors pledged to that president. You won't know who those electors are,  and sometimes ""the voters get confused about the electors and accidently vote for the wrong candidate"".¶¶Another thing that could happen is that the state legislatures can choose electors that can go againts with what the people choose. Like for example, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"". Also they can completely refuse to vote for their party's candidate and go and vote for who ever they want. Which wouldn't be fair to the people who thought they voted for the candidate. But in reality they voted for a party of electors that can go againts the party's candidate and vote for whomever they please.¶¶The ""winner take all system"" is aslo unfair. because some candidates go to certain states where they know they have a chance of winning. But completely ignore other states that they know they won't have a chance in winning. Like for example, "" During the 2000 campaign, atleast 17 states didnt get to see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad"".¶¶So in conclusion, The Electoral College shoud get changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because The voters vote aren't really voteing for the candidate. They are actually voteing for the party of electors for the candidate. But those electors can refuse to vote for the candidate and vote for anybody else. (Which woudn't be fair to the voter). And finally becuase the ""winner takes all system isnt' fair"".                  ",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,,,

Also they can completely refuse to vote for their party's candidate and go and vote for who ever they want. Which wouldn't be fair to the people who thought they voted for the candidate. But in reality they voted for a party of electors that can go againts the party's candidate and vote for whomever they please.¶¶The ""winner take all system"" is aslo unfair. because some candidates go to certain states where they know they have a chance of winning. But completely ignore other states that they know they won't have a chance in winning. Like for example, "" During the 2000 campaign, atleast 17 states didnt get to see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad"".¶¶So in conclusion, The Electoral College shoud get changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because The voters vote aren't really voteing for the candidate. They are actually voteing for the party of electors for the candidate. But those electors can refuse to vote for the candidate and vote for anybody else. (Which woudn't be fair to the voter). And finally becuase the ""winner takes all system isnt' fair"".                  ",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,,,

","No Texting On the Road: Eliminating Distractions on the Roads¶¶In today's society, everyone is forced to find ways to be the most productive they can possibly be in order to complete their daily tasks.¶¶Commutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.¶¶People spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).¶¶But texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.¶¶Just in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Cell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.¶¶Some states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.¶¶When one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.¶¶When it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.¶¶The first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.¶¶The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.¶¶During 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).¶¶Distracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.¶¶Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).¶¶The person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.¶¶If the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it's important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.¶¶Just in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).¶¶Over the total year, that's nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.¶¶If that's not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.¶¶With distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.¶¶When it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.¶¶New drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.¶¶For new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).¶¶All of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.¶¶42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Multitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies accumulated by organizations studying drivers and their habits while on the road, and for new drivers, attention to detail is imperative (It Still Works).¶¶If high school students admitted to driving and texting at the same time, many of them also admitted that they forgot to wear their seatbelt while driving, which further would increase their risk of injury, or in the worst case scenario, death (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Those under the age of 20 years old are more prone to distracted driving, so it is important to take matters into their own hands (It Still Works).¶¶Teens and all drivers alike are encouraged to not only put their phone away and take care of tasks before turning the key in the ignition, but to also put their phone on Do Not Disturb, a feature available from nearly every phone today (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Eliminating stress and being entirely present in the activity of driving is a must, and for new drivers and experienced drivers alike, if everyone can be mindful of their habits on the roads, stress will decrease, as well as optimal brain usage.¶¶In terms of health, using cell phones while driving is not a great decision for anyone.¶¶Cell phone use while driving has been said to reduce brain activity by about 36% while on the roads, which contributes to a greater risk of injury and/or death and accidents (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Over time, however, this habit could contribute to other areas of life.¶¶Using cell phones while driving could translate to other aspects of a person's life, leading to what could be perceived as an addiction to technology.¶¶Without constant connection to cellular devices, it could not only impact someone's attention on the roads, someone's brain health and optimization, but also what could become of someone's productivity.¶¶This is not just a matter of driving, but a matter of quality of life.¶¶Would it be productive or even healthy for someone to spend their entire lives glued to their phone, inattentive to the world around them?¶¶When it comes to driving on the roads, the answer is clear: using cell phones while driving leads to less productivity and alertness, and the consequences are immediately present.¶¶If society does not take accountability for one's deliberate attention to detail while on the road, there's more at risk than just one missed text or a late work assignment.¶¶People's lives and health are at stake, as well as the quality of their daily routine.¶¶Alas, cell phones are a great part of the world today, but they do not need to hold a great place of importance when behind the wheel.¶¶It's more than just health and brain related issues or even the amount of stress drivers of all experiences face, but it's about danger.¶¶Is it worth the risk to send that text to a friend while on the way to one's destination?¶¶There's advertisements, stories, news articles, and movies about the topic floating around, but some people don't take it as seriously as it needs to be.¶¶It's not about collective action, or rather many people doing the same thing at once, but about many people deciding to take action on their own accord.¶¶So, it is up the individual: take action and be safe, or increase the risk for not only one person, but the lives of the many people one might face on their daily commute.¶¶It's all a choice, but either way, the future will show the consequences of what society decides to make of this information.¶¶Works Cited¶¶Cornell, Scott.

","Everday, wether we are in a classroom, at our house, or out in public, we are constantly decoding the emotions around us. For example, when your friend walks up to you with a stern face and squinted eyes, you will most likley assume that he or she is angry with you. Recognizing facial expressions is something we as human beings have done for the past thousands of years, sometimes involuntary. With that being said, we do not need a computer software to tell us everything we already know, a frown means you are upset, a stern face means you are mad, a lopsided eyebrow means you are confused, and a smile means you are happy. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.¶¶Being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions, may sound like an awesome idea. However, this program is 100% useless. A system that can decode a humans emotion is udderly pointless, for no one needs to know the exact compostion of a human face and their emotions. As stated in the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation""every day."" I mean just think about it, what would you do if you knew the exact percent of happiness in someone, or maybe the percent of saddness? Exaclty, you would do nothing. That information is useless and a waste of time and money. We don't need a machine to exemplify the percise decimal of happiness, sadness, or confusin in any one person.¶¶Whenever you buy a new computer, a new software, or even basic technolgy needs, the prices are always far above then what you predicted. That same concept includes this new software called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This devloped and intelligent program will cost a pretty penny, without a doubt, for both the producer and the consumer. Not only will you need to forfit you money for this program, but most at home computers are uncapable to withold the magnitude of this program. The article states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Spending money, time, and effort on a skill humans have already learned is pointless and fruitless. The development of the technolgy industry has allowed for billions of dollars to be consempated, allowing for the goverment to go in debt, among other things as well. Introducing this program to the population will allow for money that has been worked hard for, be thrown down the drain.¶¶Incorporating this new software program into classrooms around the globe is unessary for the development of students minds. Being able to detect specific emotions in a school setting is useless and a waste of time and money. Teachers are going to college, getting a degree, and expandign their teaching limits in order to be able to correctly investigate and discover the emotions of their students. As a teacher, that is their job. Introducing this technolgy into classrooms will not be beneficial, for knowing exaclty the percent compostion of one persons emotion is pointless, useless, and a frutile attempt to expanding the technology industry.¶¶FACS is a new, intelligent, developed software system that allows for the emotions of any one person be decomposed into specific percent numerals. This evolving program incorporates new and imporoved technolgy functions into a redily avalible software. However, introducing this program to the world with cause nothing but useless and pointless results. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.                    ","How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.¶¶The first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.¶¶Also, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.¶¶Secondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a pain to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.¶¶Finally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.¶¶Forcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.         ","Dear Principle,¶¶I believe that a student with a C average should be able to participate in sports. If you have a C you are still passing and have a average grade. And I believe that is enough to play sports or other school activities.¶¶A B is a good grade but you should not need one to play sports. If someone has a D they should not play, but a C is a good passing grade. If you have anything lower than a C you should sit, but if you have a good passing grade like a C you should still be able to play. I myself have to work very hard to get an A or B, so I think it is just fair to be able to play with a passing C.¶¶If many students have a C average your schools teams will have not many people and many would not get to play. I think if I had an above par grade and I would be very upset if I had to sit. I feel that kids that at least pass should be aloud to play sports or other activities in school.¶¶If someone on the team was not very smart but he could pass I believe that he should still be aloud to play. I say this because he is not failing school he still has a low passing grade. It would just be unfair to the kids that have C' s. They are still passing in school but yet they cant play sports. To me that is just unfair!¶¶These are some of the reasons why i think you could have a C but still play sports. I can kind of see were the school is coming from to try to make there kids smarter but I believe a child with a C or above should still be able to play sports or other school activities.","Generic_Name¶¶Mr. Generic_Name 10/11/20¶¶Why People Should Always Get Multiple Opinions¶¶When making an important decision, or just asking for advice, people should always talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions will help them be more successful by giving you more views on a topic. If someone seek multiple opinions, they will make smarter, more knowledgeable and better choices because they will help give you a more accurate response as well as different opinions.¶¶One key reason why someone should ask multiple people for their opinion is because they will get more accurate data. For example, If someone asked one person a question and they answered yes, then they would be more likely to agree with the person that answered, but if they asked ten people and only the first person said yes, then it would be unlikely for them to agree with the person that said yes. This means that people will be more informed when asking multiple people instead of one.¶¶Another reason why someone should ask more than one person is because everyone has a different opinion. Their opinion could be based on their background, beliefs, ethnicity, wealth, gender and many other reasons. This means that it is important to ask multiple people because everyone thinks differently about certain topics. One example would be politics. People often have different political beliefs based on where they live, their race, their wealth, and other factors, because of this, it is important to ask people that are different from you in these categories. They could have a completely different opinion that you have never thought of, and could swing your view on a issue.¶¶Lastly, people that ask multiple other people for their opinions will often be more successful with whatever they are trying to do or achieve. If a someone asks multiple people, then the people asked will help them come to a decision. The decision that will be made will be informed by others that they ask, and will be better than the choice that they would have made if they had no help or advice.¶¶Some people say that if someone asks multiple people for advice, that would mean that they would no longer be come up with an opinion for themselves. This is incorrect because a persons opinion is based on what other people say or do. With out other people to give advice, people would not be able to create the same opinions.¶¶These are multiple reasons talking to more then one person will help you get better advice than if you were to just get one opinion. Asking multiple opinions will give you a more accurate overall view on how people feel about something as well as help someone become more successful. Getting more than one opinion can even help people think about things they had not previously thought about or considered.      ",I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.¶¶When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.¶¶Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high school college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.¶¶Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.¶¶In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as well due to the amount of time given. ,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,,,,,

","Everday, wether we are in a classroom, at our house, or out in public, we are constantly decoding the emotions around us. For example, when your friend walks up to you with a stern face and squinted eyes, you will most likley assume that he or she is angry with you. Recognizing facial expressions is something we as human beings have done for the past thousands of years, sometimes involuntary. With that being said, we do not need a computer software to tell us everything we already know, a frown means you are upset, a stern face means you are mad, a lopsided eyebrow means you are confused, and a smile means you are happy. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.¶¶Being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions, may sound like an awesome idea. However, this program is 100% useless. A system that can decode a humans emotion is udderly pointless, for no one needs to know the exact compostion of a human face and their emotions. As stated in the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation""every day."" I mean just think about it, what would you do if you knew the exact percent of happiness in someone, or maybe the percent of saddness? Exaclty, you would do nothing. That information is useless and a waste of time and money. We don't need a machine to exemplify the percise decimal of happiness, sadness, or confusin in any one person.¶¶Whenever you buy a new computer, a new software, or even basic technolgy needs, the prices are always far above then what you predicted. That same concept includes this new software called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This devloped and intelligent program will cost a pretty penny, without a doubt, for both the producer and the consumer. Not only will you need to forfit you money for this program, but most at home computers are uncapable to withold the magnitude of this program. The article states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Spending money, time, and effort on a skill humans have already learned is pointless and fruitless. The development of the technolgy industry has allowed for billions of dollars to be consempated, allowing for the goverment to go in debt, among other things as well. Introducing this program to the population will allow for money that has been worked hard for, be thrown down the drain.¶¶Incorporating this new software program into classrooms around the globe is unessary for the development of students minds. Being able to detect specific emotions in a school setting is useless and a waste of time and money. Teachers are going to college, getting a degree, and expandign their teaching limits in order to be able to correctly investigate and discover the emotions of their students. As a teacher, that is their job.

","How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.¶¶The first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.¶¶Also, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.¶¶Secondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a pain to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.¶¶Finally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.¶¶Forcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.         ","Dear Principle,¶¶I believe that a student with a C average should be able to participate in sports. If you have a C you are still passing and have a average grade. And I believe that is enough to play sports or other school activities.¶¶A B is a good grade but you should not need one to play sports. If someone has a D they should not play, but a C is a good passing grade. If you have anything lower than a C you should sit, but if you have a good passing grade like a C you should still be able to play. I myself have to work very hard to get an A or B, so I think it is just fair to be able to play with a passing C.¶¶If many students have a C average your schools teams will have not many people and many would not get to play. I think if I had an above par grade and I would be very upset if I had to sit. I feel that kids that at least pass should be aloud to play sports or other activities in school.¶¶If someone on the team was not very smart but he could pass I believe that he should still be aloud to play. I say this because he is not failing school he still has a low passing grade. It would just be unfair to the kids that have C' s. They are still passing in school but yet they cant play sports. To me that is just unfair!¶¶These are some of the reasons why i think you could have a C but still play sports. I can kind of see were the school is coming from to try to make there kids smarter but I believe a child with a C or above should still be able to play sports or other school activities.","Generic_Name¶¶Mr. Generic_Name 10/11/20¶¶Why People Should Always Get Multiple Opinions¶¶When making an important decision, or just asking for advice, people should always talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions will help them be more successful by giving you more views on a topic. If someone seek multiple opinions, they will make smarter, more knowledgeable and better choices because they will help give you a more accurate response as well as different opinions.¶¶One key reason why someone should ask multiple people for their opinion is because they will get more accurate data. For example, If someone asked one person a question and they answered yes, then they would be more likely to agree with the person that answered, but if they asked ten people and only the first person said yes, then it would be unlikely for them to agree with the person that said yes. This means that people will be more informed when asking multiple people instead of one.¶¶Another reason why someone should ask more than one person is because everyone has a different opinion. Their opinion could be based on their background, beliefs, ethnicity, wealth, gender and many other reasons. This means that it is important to ask multiple people because everyone thinks differently about certain topics. One example would be politics. People often have different political beliefs based on where they live, their race, their wealth, and other factors, because of this, it is important to ask people that are different from you in these categories. They could have a completely different opinion that you have never thought of, and could swing your view on a issue.¶¶Lastly, people that ask multiple other people for their opinions will often be more successful with whatever they are trying to do or achieve. If a someone asks multiple people, then the people asked will help them come to a decision. The decision that will be made will be informed by others that they ask, and will be better than the choice that they would have made if they had no help or advice.¶¶Some people say that if someone asks multiple people for advice, that would mean that they would no longer be come up with an opinion for themselves. This is incorrect because a persons opinion is based on what other people say or do. With out other people to give advice, people would not be able to create the same opinions.¶¶These are multiple reasons talking to more then one person will help you get better advice than if you were to just get one opinion. Asking multiple opinions will give you a more accurate overall view on how people feel about something as well as help someone become more successful. Getting more than one opinion can even help people think about things they had not previously thought about or considered.      ",I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.¶¶When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.¶¶Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high school college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.¶¶Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.¶¶In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as well due to the amount of time given. ,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,,,,,

They are not able to react to new or unforseen senarios, they would cause people to become comfortable and be unprepared in the case of a problem. People will overall become worse driverse and be more werried and more likely to panick in case of a siguation needing their atention manifesting it self. In adition a car is an item some people hold very closely and injoy driving, these people will likely resist driverless cars, making for an uncomfertable mix of the two. For these reasons it is my beleif that driverless cars are not the future and will in no way benifit society.¶¶The driverless cars produced so far require humans to take over in siduations such as backing in and out of driveways, the visinity around ancidents, and unforseen complications. Right now these cars are only able to handle low speeds around 25 mph, and relly heavely on human intervention. Perhaps the greatest problem is the expence, the equitment is heavy expencive and likely requires constant revisions to the design as knew flaws are revealed, as well as constant repair. To add to that any accidents that do accore will can not be blamed on human error, so any manufactorer would have many additional expenses in court, not to mension how many laws must be changed in order to make any of this posible. Any human driver would have to remain alert at all time to make sore that the car is making no error, but seeing the miles go by any driver would be luld into a fake sence of confort and reliability.¶¶In conclusion, through expences and through the impracticality of the entire concept this is an idea unlikely to make it to the market. People would blame any misshap on the unsentiant driver, and they would be very hard to rebuke which in adition to the manufactoring cost would make this undoable for most manufactering componies do to the cost alone. Laws woud need to change,people would become worse drivers, and would be unprepared for taking over. The most difficult parts of driving would be left for the humans. This idea is intreging but it is as many ideas are, impracticle, and very, very expensive.                  ","No Texting On the Road: Eliminating Distractions on the Roads¶¶In today's society, everyone is forced to find ways to be the most productive they can possibly be in order to complete their daily tasks.¶¶Commutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.¶¶People spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).¶¶But texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.¶¶Just in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Cell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.¶¶Some states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.¶¶When one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.¶¶When it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.¶¶The first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.¶¶The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.¶¶During 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).¶¶Distracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.¶¶Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).¶¶The person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.¶¶If the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it's important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.¶¶Just in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).¶¶Over the total year, that's nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.¶¶If that's not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.¶¶With distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.¶¶When it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.¶¶New drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.¶¶For new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).¶¶All of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.¶¶42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Multitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies

The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.¶¶Forcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.         ","Dear Principle,¶¶I believe that a student with a C average should be able to participate in sports. If you have a C you are still passing and have a average grade. And I believe that is enough to play sports or other school activities.¶¶A B is a good grade but you should not need one to play sports. If someone has a D they should not play, but a C is a good passing grade. If you have anything lower than a C you should sit, but if you have a good passing grade like a C you should still be able to play. I myself have to work very hard to get an A or B, so I think it is just fair to be able to play with a passing C.¶¶If many students have a C average your schools teams will have not many people and many would not get to play. I think if I had an above par grade and I would be very upset if I had to sit. I feel that kids that at least pass should be aloud to play sports or other activities in school.¶¶If someone on the team was not very smart but he could pass I believe that he should still be aloud to play. I say this because he is not failing school he still has a low passing grade. It would just be unfair to the kids that have C' s. They are still passing in school but yet they cant play sports. To me that is just unfair!¶¶These are some of the reasons why i think you could have a C but still play sports. I can kind of see were the school is coming from to try to make there kids smarter but I believe a child with a C or above should still be able to play sports or other school activities.","Generic_Name¶¶Mr. Generic_Name 10/11/20¶¶Why People Should Always Get Multiple Opinions¶¶When making an important decision, or just asking for advice, people should always talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions will help them be more successful by giving you more views on a topic. If someone seek multiple opinions, they will make smarter, more knowledgeable and better choices because they will help give you a more accurate response as well as different opinions.¶¶One key reason why someone should ask multiple people for their opinion is because they will get more accurate data. For example, If someone asked one person a question and they answered yes, then they would be more likely to agree with the person that answered, but if they asked ten people and only the first person said yes, then it would be unlikely for them to agree with the person that said yes. This means that people will be more informed when asking multiple people instead of one.¶¶Another reason why someone should ask more than one person is because everyone has a different opinion. Their opinion could be based on their background, beliefs, ethnicity, wealth, gender and many other reasons. This means that it is important to ask multiple people because everyone thinks differently about certain topics. One example would be politics. People often have different political beliefs based on where they live, their race, their wealth, and other factors, because of this, it is important to ask people that are different from you in these categories. They could have a completely different opinion that you have never thought of, and could swing your view on a issue.¶¶Lastly, people that ask multiple other people for their opinions will often be more successful with whatever they are trying to do or achieve. If a someone asks multiple people, then the people asked will help them come to a decision. The decision that will be made will be informed by others that they ask, and will be better than the choice that they would have made if they had no help or advice.¶¶Some people say that if someone asks multiple people for advice, that would mean that they would no longer be come up with an opinion for themselves. This is incorrect because a persons opinion is based on what other people say or do. With out other people to give advice, people would not be able to create the same opinions.¶¶These are multiple reasons talking to more then one person will help you get better advice than if you were to just get one opinion. Asking multiple opinions will give you a more accurate overall view on how people feel about something as well as help someone become more successful. Getting more than one opinion can even help people think about things they had not previously thought about or considered.      ",I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.¶¶When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.¶¶Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high school college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.¶¶Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.¶¶In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as well due to the amount of time given. ,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,,,,,,

They are not able to react to new or unforseen senarios, they would cause people to become comfortable and be unprepared in the case of a problem. People will overall become worse driverse and be more werried and more likely to panick in case of a siguation needing their atention manifesting it self. In adition a car is an item some people hold very closely and injoy driving, these people will likely resist driverless cars, making for an uncomfertable mix of the two. For these reasons it is my beleif that driverless cars are not the future and will in no way benifit society.¶¶The driverless cars produced so far require humans to take over in siduations such as backing in and out of driveways, the visinity around ancidents, and unforseen complications. Right now these cars are only able to handle low speeds around 25 mph, and relly heavely on human intervention. Perhaps the greatest problem is the expence, the equitment is heavy expencive and likely requires constant revisions to the design as knew flaws are revealed, as well as constant repair. To add to that any accidents that do accore will can not be blamed on human error, so any manufactorer would have many additional expenses in court, not to mension how many laws must be changed in order to make any of this posible. Any human driver would have to remain alert at all time to make sore that the car is making no error, but seeing the miles go by any driver would be luld into a fake sence of confort and reliability.¶¶In conclusion, through expences and through the impracticality of the entire concept this is an idea unlikely to make it to the market. People would blame any misshap on the unsentiant driver, and they would be very hard to rebuke which in adition to the manufactoring cost would make this undoable for most manufactering componies do to the cost alone. Laws woud need to change,people would become worse drivers, and would be unprepared for taking over. The most difficult parts of driving would be left for the humans. This idea is intreging but it is as many ideas are, impracticle, and very, very expensive.                  ","No Texting On the Road: Eliminating Distractions on the Roads¶¶In today's society, everyone is forced to find ways to be the most productive they can possibly be in order to complete their daily tasks.¶¶Commutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.¶¶People spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).¶¶But texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.¶¶Just in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Cell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.¶¶Some states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.¶¶When one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.¶¶When it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.¶¶The first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.¶¶The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.¶¶During 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).¶¶Distracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.¶¶Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).¶¶The person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.¶¶If the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it's important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.¶¶Just in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).¶¶Over the total year, that's nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.¶¶If that's not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.¶¶With distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.¶¶When it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.¶¶New drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.¶¶For new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).¶¶All of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.¶¶42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Multitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies accumulated by organizations studying drivers and their habits while on the road, and for new drivers, attention to detail is imperative (It Still Works).¶¶If high school students admitted to driving and texting at the same time, many of them also admitted that they forgot to wear their seatbelt while driving, which further would increase their risk of injury, or in the worst case scenario, death (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Those under the age of 20 years old are more prone to distracted driving, so it is important to take matters into their own hands (It Still Works).¶¶Teens and all drivers alike are encouraged to not only put their phone away and take care of tasks before turning the key in the ignition, but to also put their phone on Do Not Disturb, a feature available from nearly every phone today (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Eliminating stress and being entirely present in the activity of driving is a must, and for new drivers and experienced drivers alike, if everyone can be mindful of their habits on the roads, stress will decrease, as well as optimal brain usage.¶¶In terms of health, using cell phones while driving is not a great decision for anyone.¶¶Cell phone use while driving has been said to reduce brain activity by about 36% while on the roads, which contributes to a greater risk of injury and/or death and accidents (Teen Driver Source).¶¶Over time, however, this habit could contribute to other areas of life.¶¶Using cell phones while driving could translate to other aspects of a person's life, leading to what could be perceived as an addiction to technology.¶¶Without constant connection to cellular devices, it could not only impact someone's attention on the roads, someone's brain health and optimization, but also what could become of someone's productivity.¶¶This is not just a matter of driving, but a matter of quality of life.¶¶Would it be productive or even healthy for someone to spend their entire lives glued to their phone, inattentive to the world around them?¶¶When it comes to driving on the roads, the answer is clear: using cell phones while driving leads to less productivity and alertness, and the consequences are immediately present.¶¶If society does not take accountability for one's deliberate attention to detail while on the road, there's more at risk than just one missed text or a late work assignment.¶¶People's lives and health are at stake, as well as the quality of their daily routine.¶¶Alas, cell phones are a great part of the world today, but they do not need to hold a great place of importance when behind the wheel.¶¶It's more than just health and brain related issues or even the amount of stress drivers of all experiences face, but it's about danger.¶¶Is it worth the risk to send that text to a friend while on the way to one's destination?¶¶There's advertisements, stories, news articles, and movies about the topic floating around, but some people don't take it as seriously as it needs to be.¶¶It's not about collective action, or rather many people doing the same thing at once, but about many people deciding to take action on their own accord.¶¶So, it is up the individual: take action and be safe, or increase the risk for not only one person, but the lives of the many people one might face on their daily commute.¶¶It's all a choice, but either way, the future will show the consequences of what society decides to make of this information.¶¶Works Cited¶¶Cornell, Scott.

","Everday, wether we are in a classroom, at our house, or out in public, we are constantly decoding the emotions around us. For example, when your friend walks up to you with a stern face and squinted eyes, you will most likley assume that he or she is angry with you. Recognizing facial expressions is something we as human beings have done for the past thousands of years, sometimes involuntary. With that being said, we do not need a computer software to tell us everything we already know, a frown means you are upset, a stern face means you are mad, a lopsided eyebrow means you are confused, and a smile means you are happy. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.¶¶Being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions, may sound like an awesome idea. However, this program is 100% useless. A system that can decode a humans emotion is udderly pointless, for no one needs to know the exact compostion of a human face and their emotions. As stated in the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation""every day."" I mean just think about it, what would you do if you knew the exact percent of happiness in someone, or maybe the percent of saddness? Exaclty, you would do nothing. That information is useless and a waste of time and money. We don't need a machine to exemplify the percise decimal of happiness, sadness, or confusin in any one person.¶¶Whenever you buy a new computer, a new software, or even basic technolgy needs, the prices are always far above then what you predicted. That same concept includes this new software called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This devloped and intelligent program will cost a pretty penny, without a doubt, for both the producer and the consumer. Not only will you need to forfit you money for this program, but most at home computers are uncapable to withold the magnitude of this program. The article states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Spending money, time, and effort on a skill humans have already learned is pointless and fruitless. The development of the technolgy industry has allowed for billions of dollars to be consempated, allowing for the goverment to go in debt, among other things as well. Introducing this program to the population will allow for money that has been worked hard for, be thrown down the drain.¶¶Incorporating this new software program into classrooms around the globe is unessary for the development of students minds. Being able to detect specific emotions in a school setting is useless and a waste of time and money. Teachers are going to college, getting a degree, and expandign their teaching limits in order to be able to correctly investigate and discover the emotions of their students. As a teacher, that is their job. Introducing this technolgy into classrooms will not be beneficial, for knowing exaclty the percent compostion of one persons emotion is pointless, useless, and a frutile attempt to expanding the technology industry.¶¶FACS is a new, intelligent, developed software system that allows for the emotions of any one person be decomposed into specific percent numerals. This evolving program incorporates new and imporoved technolgy functions into a redily avalible software. However, introducing this program to the world with cause nothing but useless and pointless results. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.                    ","How would you feel if your principle told you how to spend your time outside of school? When and why you should do something? Before you decide, read the essay on why students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities.¶¶The first topic is that making students participate could make the activity less fun. It would be unfair to the people who want to participate. People who want to do the activity should not have to deal with someone who does not have a passion for the activity, and frankly, does not want to be there.¶¶Also, the person who is being forced may not have an interest in the topic and will not benefit the team. Forcing students to do something they do not want to do could slow the entire group down. The student could be rushing to do their share of the work so the can get to do other things. Therefore, they might not do the job to the best of their abilities. This could result in the entire group having to do more work and preventing them from doing other projects.¶¶Secondly, time management. As we all know students lives can be difficult and a pain to manage. Making time for your family is something every kid should do. However, by making kids participate in a club, they might have to start cutting out family time from their hectic schedule. In health class the teachers tell us to always make time for your family. How would we make time for our family if we have to participate in a club that takes up our free time? Next, the hardest thing to manage is school. Adding this requirement could make it harder for some students to have time to do their homework, projects, and study for their tests. Taking away the students right to choose could result in their grades and SOL scores going down. The next example is friends. Making kids participate could lead to them canceling plans with friends, and result in them losing their friends, because now their free time has been taken up doing these clubs they have no passion for.¶¶Finally, this could make it harder to socialize. Forcing students to participate could lead to other members of the club resenting them for not doing their share of the work. Which, sadly, could end friendships before they even have a chance. Some people will say that by making them do this they will make more friends. However, friendships cannot be forced, and they have to start with something two people have in common. Next, by forcing kids to join clubs, they will not make friends because they could be the only person in the group who does not want to be there. This means they might not pursue a friendship because it started off with something they do not have in common. The last example is that this could lead to bullying. The student who does not want to be in the club could feel singled out because no one wants to talk to them because they do not have anything in common. Therefore, the student will feel bullied and singled out of the entire class.¶¶Forcing kids to participate in these activities, is not in their best interests because it will make the activities less fun, harder to fit in their schedule, and will make it difficult to socialize. Forcing kids to participate in activities can only serve to hurt them inside and outside of school.         ","Dear Principle,¶¶I believe that a student with a C average should be able to participate in sports.

You get to travel the world to places you have only dreamed about visiting. You will be working with animals throughout the day, growing a tight bond with them. And you will have the chance to meet new people with different cultures and up-bringings. Become a Seagoing Cowboy today! You will not be disappointed.","Dear Principal,¶¶With respect, I think it would be unfair to force teens into community service. I think if you encouraged us a little more, some would find the time for it. Others cannot find the time for it. Some students are taking after school classes such as dance, music, art and other things. Other students have family matters or are piled on with tons of homework that is mandatory to get done.¶¶In all honesty forcing students into community service would only make them angry. They would find ways to get out of it or would pull parents into it. Which would only cause way more problems than the school needs or already has. And that is only a small portion of students.¶¶As for those taking extra curricular classes, they would be just as disappointed. They would most likely have to drop out of those classes to find time for community service. Those students would be upset for having to stop dong something they enjoy for something they are pushed into. Which again would bring parents into the picture.¶¶Those with family matters such as sick relatives or far away relatives would probably be more sad than anything. Being pulled away from the extra time they have to go visit family is now being put in to community service.¶¶This would put more unwilling students into community service.¶¶Plus, those with tons of homework who are struggling to get it all finished are struggling more. Having to work harder because they don't have as much time as they used to. This leads to grades dropping and suddenly A and B students failing.¶¶In my opinion, students should have the right to decide for themselves to participate or not. That means less drama for the school and more happy teens. Which is fantastic news for you. I hope this helps you in your decision.¶¶Sincerely, Anonymous Student","Some people choose to say that the Face was created by aliens, but I am here to tell you that it definetly is not an alien structure, simply a natural landform. In 1976 I must say, it certainley did resemble a man made face. Though now that we have a clearer picture from 2001 it is very obviously just a natural landform. It resembles landforms similiar to the ones around the Amercian West. It is really just the Martian equivilent to those particular landfoms. The two are so similar in formation and shape.¶¶The most recent picture is so clear and high definition that even if it werre some kind of shack or Egyptian pyramid, you would know it for a fact. The picture taken in 1998 was on a slightly cloudy day, so I understand the doubt from some of you. Though we did take another picture, and it was on a very clear summer day, and it is mothing but a simple lava dome, that has taken the form of an isolated mesa about the same height os the Face on Mars.¶¶It was very hard work just to try and get that picture, and I would like to assure you that it is definetly no ""Martian Made"" structure. We got very close on a very clear day, and you can definelty see that those were just shadows, and nothing short of a dissapointment. What you don't understand is, that it would benifit us if it was a Martian's craft. It would give the tax payers evidence and reason to support us and give us their money to support the cause. SO therefore I rest my case tht clearly we are not lying because it would benifit us if there were Aliens crafting these thing, but the simple fact is, there isn't.","In ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus,"" the author uses many details to suggest how venus is important to explore even though the risks are extremely high.¶¶The first example of how the author proves that venus is worth exploring is in paragraph 4 the author states, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The author uses this quote from NASA in the article to show how even though they know its extremly risky, people are still trying to find solutions rather than leaving the problem.¶¶The second example is in paragraph 7, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions."" This example shows how the scientists are so curious in Venus that they simulating the harsh conditions to make strong technology to survive on Venus.¶¶The third example is in paragraph 8, the author states ""Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author uses this example to summaraize that if we take the time and make the technology to explore Venus, then good things could come out of the solutions.¶¶In conclusion, the author uses all these examples and more to greatly explain why exploring Venus even though scientists are very aware of the many dangers, is such a good idea to invest time into.","Imagine you are attending classes at home you wouldn' t take it seriously as you do at school. Kids who are home schooled don't usually focus as much as they would at school. Some kids parents or tutor would give them more advantages that aren't given at school. Such as more breaks, better food options for lunch,linear schedule, and starting and ending time being optional. If students are learning a specific lesson by a video conference they wouldnt benefit the lesson as well as being offline. Students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would take advantage, start on their own time, and they wouldn't understand the lesson.¶¶Schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conferencing. I used to baby sit this little girl named Generic_Name she went to school for two years now shes in the third grade and her parents are homeschooling her. Sometimes Generic_Name goes out to eat for lunch and she wakes up later than normal elementary kids do. Learning a lesson through a video isn't very beneficial for some students because they probably need more help understanding. The teacher can explain the lesson in a different way if the student doesn't understand but if they keep watching the video it isn't going to help them.¶¶Although,some may believe schools should offer distance learning as an option for students because they need a numerous amount of breaks, they should be able to work on their own time, and it's the same as an online class. Distance learning is the same thing as taking online classes or taking a college class online.¶¶Distance learning shouldn't be an option this is important because it can affect the way kids learn and how they understand it. Students can be thinking of the lesson in a different format than how the lesson is expressed in the video conference. It was important in the past being it wasn't and option because they didn't have the technology resources that we have today. It helps in the future because instead of going to college you can take an online college class and you would already have experience from it. If you are attending classes from home then you switch your routine and go to school you are going to be more experienced with online conferencing and you are going to be wanting to do everything on your own.         ","Phones & Driving¶¶Do you use your phone while you're driving? Or do you be in the car with people who use their phone while they're driving? I believe we should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.¶¶Emergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you're on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.¶¶Most people don't know there way round the whole entire world. It's not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don't want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say ""Why not just use a map""? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?¶¶Weather is important while you're driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you're going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?¶¶Seeing all should of changed your mind. If not changed your mind it made you rethink things. Just remember using phones while driving is okay. We should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.                         ",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,,,,,

If someone was to have an issue, they could ask a group of people they trust like their family and hear their opinions to help them out. Getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can compare and see which one you like best, if you hear something more than once, you are more likely to start agreeing with what the person says, and maybe the people you ask have gone through the same thing and you can predict the outcome of the situation before it happens.¶¶For example, you can compare and see which one you like best. Someone could give you some advice that seems kind of sketchy but if you don't ask anybody else so then you might do what they told you to and the situation can end up even worse than what it was when you started. A better choice would be to not just ask one person but instead asking many different people to see which one you are most comfortable with and that suits you and your personality. Say you were a shy person and you ask someone that's almost the exact opposite of you and the advice they give you is kind of bold and out there which isn't who you are so you would ask another person who might have a more conservative piece of advice and choose to listen to them and everything works out because you were more comfortable with the conservative idea which you may not have gotten unless you asked more than one person.¶¶Another example is, if you hear something more than once, you are more likely to to start agreeing with what the person said. Say you were asking your friends opinion on something you want to get and they all start saying that is was pretty and that it looked good, you would be more reassured to buy that item because more than one person said that they like it. Studies show that people will agree with or do something if more than one person says it. When you hear the same piece of advice more than once, your brain encourages that piece of advice because hearing it over and over is a sign that maybe it will work and that you should listen.¶¶The last reason is, maybe the people you ask have gone through exactly what you are going through because then you will be able to predict what's going to happen if you do take their advice and see what the outcome might be. If you were to ask your mom to help you with getting a boy to like you and then you ask your aunt or your grandmother but after you ask them what the outcome was and your aunt was the only one who ended up being with that person, you would do what your aunt said instead of your mom and grandmother because their advice didn't work out in the long run and your aunts did.¶¶In conclusion, asking many different people that you trust for their opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can decide on which piece of advice fits you and your personality best, you might hear it twice so then you might start agreeing with what that person said to do, and asking many different people can help you predict what might happen if you were to do the same thing that person did. ","To the Principal:¶¶I am for policy 1, because of many reasons. Policy 1 does state that cell phones can be used during free-time and lunch periods, cell phones are a handy when you need to communicate with someone, and cell phones are really handy incase of an emergency.¶¶This policy does state that cell phones are only to be used during lunch times and free periods.¶¶Our lunch time is not during class time, meaning this policy does not interrupt teachers or distract us from our education. After all, cell phones are supposed to be turned off in class; so we can't use them to cheat, or be distracted by them.¶¶Cell phones are really handy when you need them to contact someone.¶¶Like if you leave something at home(like a project or a homework assignment), you can call a parent during free-time and tell them to bring it.¶¶You can also like call someone if you need tutoring, or if you just need something from a friend, like notes or the homework from a certain class.¶¶Cell phones are also handy during an emergency.¶¶Like if something were to go down at the school(like a fire, a lockdown, or an earthquake), you'd be able to tell your parents that you're okay and nothing happened to you.¶¶Also, like if you're feeling sick, you can call your parents during free time and tell your parents that you need them to pick you up.¶¶Again, I am for policy 1, because of many reasons. Policy 1 does state that cell phones can be used during free-time and lunch periods, cell phones are a handy when you need to communicate with someone, and cell phones are really handy incase of an emergency.","Did you know that there is a progarm called the Seagoing Cowboys?¶¶The Seagoing Cowboys is a program for cowboys that ride the waves caring for animals.¶¶They care for animals that live on a land that just got destroyed.¶¶There are a bunch of stories about their history.¶¶They have been on the most dangerous assignments.¶¶First of all, there is a reason that you should join.¶¶That reason is to save a lot of animals.¶¶Another reason that you should join this program is that this is right after World War 2, so animals need foof and water.¶¶There is an organization called the¶¶UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and there is only so much that group can do.¶¶On the other hand, about this Seagoing Cowboys program, you can go anywhere in the world like Europe or China.¶¶You have to make sure that you have enough supplies on the boat to care for the animals.¶¶LIke if u have horses, then you would have hay and oats.¶¶You can also take as many animals as your ship can hold.¶¶One of the boats had 335 horse and still had enough hay and oats to feed them.¶¶For the record, one more reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to go site seeing when ever you want.¶¶You could go see a national landmark while you are on the job.¶¶I remember this one person that was a Seagoing Cowboy, he went to Greece.¶¶The toughest part of this job was going over a bunch of water and getting the animals back to where they belonged.¶¶It would be so cool to be a Seagoing Cowboy.¶¶To sum up my findings, I thought that this passage was a great example o fa job to do if you love animals.¶¶I hope people consider this job.¶¶For th future, do whta you think is right and never give up if you wnat to go sme where.¶¶You should always follow your dreams even if you don't want to, cause one day that dream might come true.   ","If my principal were to instate mandatory extracurricular activities then I would probably agree with their decision. There are a verity of extracurricular activities to participate in, so there is definitely something for everybody. Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet people and make life-long friends. Furthermore, having extracurricular activities at a school can benefit the school in many ways. all in all, extracurricular activities are an important thing to have in schools.¶¶There are many kinds of extracurricular activities. If one were interested in athletics, then they have the opportunity to try out for their school's sports teams. If they were interested in academics or needed help with their studies then homework club, science club, and other clubs of similar nature are all good options. If the student so chose they could participate in the musical, an art club, a coding club, a computer making club, a jewelry making club or any number of different activities all geared toward a different kind of student. This variety makes it so an extracurricular so suit anybody is easy to find.¶¶Another benefit to extracurricular activities is their ability to help friendships. Going to a new activity allows you to meet new people with interests similar to your own. There is also the option of going to a club with somebody you are already friends with, drawing your friendship closer. I know that from a personal perspective I have made many friends, and even a few best friends, with the help of extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are a good way to make friends.¶¶On top of all that there is the simple, abject benefits that extracurricular activities have upon your school. Yearbook is a program that helps the school, and is also an extracurricular activity. The school newspaper, student council, Eco club and many similar activities also have benefits for the school. Clubs and activities also boost moral and help students associate school with excitement and fun. The benefits of these activities affect everyone and so rules that help participation in these activities should be encouraged.¶¶If my principal were to instate a rule regaurding a mandatory participation in extracurricular activities I would support it. Due to the fact that extracurriculars benefit everyone, their school, and their friendships, this rule would be a good plan. Extracurricular activities are an important thing to have in schools.","Face to face schooling is more beneficial to students then online schooling. having an electronic tell you how to do your work is not the same as a teacher, Online schooling is much easy to cheat on, they may also only have to take classes every few days.¶¶Learning through a screen is so bland with no emphasis. That is why building a bond with your teacher becomes very important throughout a year. Teachers work very hard to supply us with the correct information to succeed. Teachers take lots of well thought out time to plan throughout the year. Each day to them has a purpose, that purpose being teach the students what needs to be known and make sure they are succeeding. Teachers are responsible for the future of our nation.¶¶Cheating in school is punished by bad test scores or even detention. However, online schooling has no way in tracking cheating or punishing cheaters. While sitting at home and taking a test, each student can freely search the web and use other electronic devices to cheat off of. While testing in school you have adult supervision, and everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed. People at home have the unfair advantage of no supervision and online resources.¶¶Some may say that online schools can help kids be stress free, but all in all they are really only stress free because no pressure is being put on them to complete tasking and test by a certain time. Online schools are not beneficial to students in any grade. Without a face to face interaction things will end up being forgotten in days maybe even hours, and there will be no consequences or way of telling if there is cheating online.","STUDENT_NAME¶¶March 2, 2011¶¶Dear Principal,¶¶I have just discovered this new policy you have decided that us as students can't participate in school sports unless we have a grade B average. I do not think this is a very good policy because if you are really good in sports, but your not the best at science, or math or any subject that wouldn't fair to them. I personally have one subject I am not doing very well in, but I try and do my work and maintain the average of low B and high C. So that would consider me unable of not doing any sports. I love sports, my life revolves around sports. But just because I'm not doing good in one subject that doesn't mean I can't be part of something that makes me happy, makes me health.¶¶I also think that if you make this policy happen, kids may turn bad. if you make this happen you will just help the population of kids turning to bad influences. I know from experiences that the kids that have been on my team in the past were good at the sports they did and instead of going to a party or going in the woods to do bad things, we were at practice working as hard as we can just to win divisions, or even states. There were girls in the past who couldn't do math or didn't understand some subjects but they tried hard and maintain an A, B or C average. It wouldn't be fair to the girls who try in school, but just aren't good at the subject.¶¶My last reason is that if you change this policy, you could ruin the chances of some kids who are amazing at sports chances of getting a scholarships in sports. I know for one thing me personally I want a scholarship so badly, and I work for it too. But if I get a C in one subject that could ruin my chances of practicing and competing. Which is really hurtfully because I've worked my whole life for a scholarship. So instead of me or anyone being a pro or being an Olympic winner, we'll be working at Subway for the rest of our life's earning practically nothing. And I don't want my future to come to this quote, "" Welcome to Subway, what can I get you?""¶¶In the end, I hope that you don't change the policy, because if you do a lot of kids will have there whole life changed and maybe even ruined. And its not like a C isn't passing because it is and you should have a passing grade to play sports. Most people in school have a C or B average because its most common. And as a Principal you should be the one supporting us to be in sports and after school actives, you should know that most parents say to their kids is to get involved. In conclusion I hope you make the choice that benefits us all as students and a school.¶¶Sincerely,¶¶STUDENT_NAME","Most students wouldn't want a project over a break out of school. Over break students will wanna juust chill and be a kid but also you have to keep your grades on point. Some students are not gonna do the project over break cause I mean it's a break out of school, but if the project is required and some students need to bring up their grade then they should do it to get that grade up because projects are a big factor in classes for students. Its an oppertunity to get your grade back up or it could just be practice for you. Students should be able to choose what kind of project they want to do, the projects teachers give students are boring sometimes, some students want to get creative and do their own project and teachers can ee how creative some of their student can get when they have that oppertunity to do it. Teachers normally give out projects for when the class is doing a certain unit like in science they have units like; Volcanoes, Atmosphere, Genes, and migration. Teachers would give students projets like that and would make students stress over the project, if teachers let students take control of what kind of project their doing the class probably would be allot better and enthusiastic when it gets presented or when they get another project. Some students hate doing projects thats why some students grades be so low from when the project is due they would not turn the project in and their grade would drop serverly an dthe teacher will not let that student make up the project, yea some teachers are like that. Teachers give students projects for a reason to make sure they know the material and the concept of the lesson, some students might find the project hard so the teacher would put students in either groups of 2 or 4 at the most. Other subjects would guve students projects to like; History, Goverment, Tech Ed, Language arts, i've never seen a math teacher give students a project for math. If students have the right to choose their own kind of project that wuld make projects on students so much easier and it proably won't take as much time as normal projects do. Depending on the subject depends on how students react to the project teachers don't understand how much stress they put on students when they give students projects, students stress because they have allot of other work to do besides that project and that will push students behind and make their grade drop because of how far behind they got because that project. The projects teachers give students seem way more difficult because if students had their way with the project students would get it out the way and it wouln't even stress the out that much and it would put them in a better place to their other work snd keep their head focused. Student athletes go through it when they get a bunch of homework and then the teacher gives a project right after, then student athletes don't get home until about 7 or 8 at night and they either would be to tired to do it or would be up all night doing the work and the project on top of that so student athletes get it the worse out of any other students, because they have so much to do and some of them won't have the time to cathc up on it some students will skip practice to catch up on school work because of the amounts of school work students get. Certain projects be easy for students like, Language arts projects are easy most History projects are easy to but teahcers find a way to make them difficult. Some teachers make students do projects over break ad some students say no im not doing the project and their grade reflects that so if you get a project over a break of school make sure you do it so your grade doesn't drop and it keeps you mentally ready for when you gotta go back to school and learn new stuff but the same stuff you heard before you left for break. When teachers give students projects over break I feel like somme teachers do it on purpose but some teachers do it to keep their students in track outside of school but their is a problem with all students when they get their project over break. Studets wouldn't start it untill like 2 days before they go back to school so students woul e rushing tring to get their project to look nice and in the mean while the stidents that already started the project are most likely finish with the project so when they get back to school is go to their teacher turn the project in and make sure they have everything the need for the project to e prepped and finished at school if needed thats why you shoudl do your project's when yoy get the at school.",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,,,,,

Car pollution can also can aslo cause smog which aslo took a toll on Paris , who had to ban driving do to smog .Due to the smog delivery companies lost revenue and public transit was free of charge for a couple of days. Smog can also travel easily to other cities throughout the air. Also car usage has taken a toll on previous bills in the united states as stted in source 1 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only the other 20 percent to other transport.¶¶Limitng car usage can greatly reduce the number of traffic jams throughout cities. As staed in souce 4. During Bogata car-free day parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. There has been 118 miles of bicycle paths , which means more exercise which is good for your health.    ","Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. First the projects should be student designed, it shows more responsibility, creativity and effort. Second it gives the students' a better experience and shows different aspects of learning. Student designed projects will help the students' when they get older and move on to college and will have to do all of their work on their own.¶¶First, the projects designed by the students show tremendous responsibility, creativity and effort. The student designed projects leave the students to do it on there own; they have to worry about they want to write, what they want to prove or what they need to show. This shows the student responsibility because it's a school project over the summer that they have to complete, which most students will not even attempt to try . They will have to do the project during their own free time. And do a little of it everyday until it's complete. They can't wait last minute to do the project because it will show when they turn the project in and get a bad grade. The project show's creativity, the students or making the project and didn't get a teacher designed project. They have to come up with the whole project by themselves with only a topic to start with. The students need a creative thought process to get the project done, and in a timely manner. The project shows effort by being able to complete it and doing it right the first time, by being able to sit down and do a school project that need's to be done and you're stuck doing it during the summer. It takes a lot of effort to do a project over the summer, which is your biggest break you have off school and the most busy break for some students with sports, traveling with your family and work.¶¶Second, it gives the students' a better experience doing the project themselves and it can show different aspects of learning. It's a better experience doing it themselves because the project has to be complete by them, which is what they will have to do when they go off to college. They are not going to be able to get help from their professors' and the professors' are not going to design projects' for them in college they are going to have to learn to do it on their own. Which is a great learning opportunity for students' because it's not easy doing a project yourself and it takes practice to be able to make a good project. Doing projects can also show you different aspects of learning, By having to look up information for your project, having to do research on your topics for you to be able to complete your project. There might be some things you can't find to finish your project so you have to find valid resources, witnesses or read because you can't find anything you need on the internet, which shows a different aspect of learning because everything is on the internet nowadays.¶¶I believe student designed projects would be a better learning perspective than teacher designed projects. Students have always got assignments by teachers and have to complete them how the teachers want them completed, the projects do over the summer is a different experience there is no teacher there to tell you what to do it's all on the student, his or her views on the subject. The student can use all of the sources they find and put it into one project that wouldn't be like other class mates because they get to write about what they would like too. The teacher assigned project is not a good idea, the students will just copy and paste and can't do anything on their own. The students will have the same information because they all got the same project from the teacher. Therefore student assigned projects or better for both teachers' and students'.¶¶Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. The student designed projects are a better way for students to learn responsibility, creativity, effort and also help learn different aspects of learning for when they go off too college. Therefore projects over the summer should be student designed and not teacher designed.        ","Like the principal stated, it should be mandatory for students, at any every age, to take at least one, if not more, extracurricular activity and here's why.¶¶Students are growing, no matter if you're in kindergarten or a senior in high school, you are always growing both physically and mentally. As you grow, a lot begins to change in the world around you and extracurricular activities can help you adapt to these new changes. Your health is very important as you grow and maintaining and getting into good shape is vital to a students well being. Extracurricular activities such as conditioning, basketball, football, track, lacrosse, and other sports get you into good shape and keep you healthy. Other activities such as Shop and Home EC. teach you the necessities to life that you might not learn from anyone else. Learning to sew and cook, as well as build and repair objects, are incredibly important, especially when you buy a house, get a job, and have a family of your own.¶¶Some activities such as Chess Club and D&D Club creates a new mentality and way of thinking, allowing you to learn tactics and strategy in not only the game but also the ability to attack and solve problems in the real world at different angles. Journalism improves your writing skills as you create, edit, and re-edit your article. Journalism let's you traverse the schools grounds in search of a good story or the perfect interview to not only entertain your readers and fellow students, but also to keep them posted on current events and state of the all the things happening around them in school and it's community. Working on the yearbook immerses you into the schools community, lets you make new friendships, and create cherished memories for students and teachers to look back on for the rest of time. Such things as Homework Club let you get a jump start on homework so you can spend more time with friends and family as well as increasing the time you get to do the things you love. Math Counts and Science Olympiad keeps your brain in peak performance as you review and practice, but also learn and constantly improve your intellect and stretch your brain. Other activities, such as Debate, let you sharpen your wit, improve your ability to speak in front of an audience , advance one's argument skills, compromising skills, and working with your team to find good evidence and construct the best argument possible to defeat the opposing viewpoint.¶¶As much as these activities offer, one of the most important and crucial to students everywhere is the social experience and friends you gain. No matter what activity you participate in, you are always working with or against someone. These experiences can bring people close and let you make new friends with people you'd never met before. These people can become some of your best friends because the fact that they take that activity with you means that they probably share at least one interest with the you. I have experience with this effect myself. I live in a place where the district border of Generic_School and Generic_School, and Generic_School and Generic_School basically goes through my house. When the end of sixth grade rolled around and it was time to move on to Middle school I had a really hard time leaving. Because of this divide with the border, all the friends I had known for seven years (including kindergarten) went to Generic_School while I went to Generic_School. I had horrible anxiety and depression moving away from them, knowing I may never see some of them again and going to school that I was criminally under prepared for. Well as it turns out, my parents were much more prepared for this than I was. Years before they had signed me up for Generic_School sports instead of Generic_City sports (what all my friends did). Because I played on Generic_School lacrosse teams, basketball teams, and swim teams, I got to make a whole lot of friends from my teammates and even Generic_School athletes I had competed against. This made the transition from a place where I had spent seven years of my life with friends I had known more than half my life, to a place that I knew nothing about and barely anyone to talk to, a breeze. It was still hard to say good bye to my friends and I still didn't know many people, but the friends I had made from those sports and the new friends I made from things like D&D Club and Homework Club made middle school a fun and welcoming place.¶¶Extracurricular activities offer a lot of learning, reviewing, improvement, health benefits, social skills, organization, feelings of pride and accomplishment, helping other students, and jump start on homework, but also so much more. These activities create cherished memories and life long friends. They help you find parts of you and interests you never even knew you had. They help you find yourself and find others to help you strive along the journey of life and overcome it's most challenging obsticals.¶¶In retrospect, these activities offer so much more then what meets the eye and that's why it should be mandatory for every student at every age, to take at least one or more extracurricular activity.","Phone & Driving¶¶It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.¶¶Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.¶¶Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.¶¶Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.¶¶To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                  ","Dear Principal,¶¶Allowing students to have cell phones at school could provide an unproductive learning environment. If students are allowed to have cell phones, they could take advantage of it and use them as distractions. Also, they could get stolen or broken and then provide a lot of trouble for the school. Therefore, I believe that the school should adopt a no cell phone policy.¶¶If students were given the ability to have cell phones at school, they would then take them and use them during class as well. For instance, they might use it to text their friends or cheat on a test. This would provide a distraction from their learning that could cause them to suffer in the future. Also, many new cell phones have calculators on them which could in turn be used on a math test or quiz as an act of academic dishonesty. As a result the ability to carry cell phones at school would prove to be an unwise decision.¶¶In a case in which a cell phone were stolen or broken, it could provide a problem for the student as well as the school. If you brought a cell phone to school and it was stolen for some reason, it would cause a huge disruption. For example, the student's parents would probably be unhappy and then go and talk to the school about it. This would then cause a problem for the school and the person who stole the cell phone. Therefore, in the case of this event it would be easier just to leave the cell phone at home.¶¶Lastly, a cell phone could be used to discompose others. For example, if a person did not have a cell phone, someone else might then have reason to aggravate them or put them down. This could then cause a drop in their self esteem and prove to be very hurtful. In a similar scenario, a student might use a cell phone to upset someone else by texting or spreading rumors about others. As a result, not being able to have cell phones at school could prevent events such as this, and provide a more supportive and encouraging environment.¶¶Although some may argue that they need cell phones to contact their parents in the event of an emergency, the school would be able to provide a phone in the office that would be open to all students. Therefore, there is no case in which a cell phone would be crucial to have. Because of the distraction and complications that cell phones could cause, they should not be allowed on the school campus.¶¶Sincerely,¶¶STUDENT_NAME","In the article the author tells that even though there is alot of dangerous challenges in exploring venus and that he is willing to face them challenges. In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.¶¶In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,¶¶NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.¶¶I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. ","Dear Principal,¶¶I think you should require all students to perform community service. I think this because community service is helpful to the community, rewarding to the student, and helpful to the world as a whole.¶¶Community service is helpful to the community because it allows all members of the community to congregate and socialize while doing something beneficial for their selves. It is also helpful because the people would be making their society a better place. The people of that certain community will have an outstanding opportunity to make the place that they are living, what they would like it to be. Such things as volunteering, picking up trash, and donating can also help a community become a safer place and bring the people of that society closer together.¶¶Requiring all students to do community service is very rewarding to us students because we will know that we have done something very special. Picking up a piece of trash may seem like a simple task, but it will actually feel rewarding to us because we would know that that one piece of trash has been eliminated from our community which has eliminated a small part of the nasty dirt and grime.¶¶Community service is helpful to the world as a whole because it will make this earth a safer and cleaner place to be. Picking up trash is beneficial to us people, animals, and plants. Donating things such as clothes or food are very beneficial to those people who cannot afford those items and who are homeless. Community service can also sometimes fun; when people are having fun, they're a little bit more jolly and kind to people.¶¶Everyone should do community service at some point because it doesn't take much time, and it is very rewarding. So please require all students to do community service if you want your world to be a better place.      ",2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,,,

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.¶¶I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. ","Dear Principal,¶¶I think you should require all students to perform community service. I think this because community service is helpful to the community, rewarding to the student, and helpful to the world as a whole.¶¶Community service is helpful to the community because it allows all members of the community to congregate and socialize while doing something beneficial for their selves. It is also helpful because the people would be making their society a better place. The people of that certain community will have an outstanding opportunity to make the place that they are living, what they would like it to be. Such things as volunteering, picking up trash, and donating can also help a community become a safer place and bring the people of that society closer together.¶¶Requiring all students to do community service is very rewarding to us students because we will know that we have done something very special. Picking up a piece of trash may seem like a simple task, but it will actually feel rewarding to us because we would know that that one piece of trash has been eliminated from our community which has eliminated a small part of the nasty dirt and grime.¶¶Community service is helpful to the world as a whole because it will make this earth a safer and cleaner place to be. Picking up trash is beneficial to us people, animals, and plants. Donating things such as clothes or food are very beneficial to those people who cannot afford those items and who are homeless. Community service can also sometimes fun; when people are having fun, they're a little bit more jolly and kind to people.¶¶Everyone should do community service at some point because it doesn't take much time, and it is very rewarding. So please require all students to do community service if you want your world to be a better place.      ",2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,,,

One big advantage is a reduce in global warming. Auto-moblie causes a large percent of greenhouse gas emissions as stated in source 1, paragraph 5. Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than half. Car pollution can also can aslo cause smog which aslo took a toll on Paris , who had to ban driving do to smog .Due to the smog delivery companies lost revenue and public transit was free of charge for a couple of days. Smog can also travel easily to other cities throughout the air. Also car usage has taken a toll on previous bills in the united states as stted in source 1 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only the other 20 percent to other transport.¶¶Limitng car usage can greatly reduce the number of traffic jams throughout cities. As staed in souce 4. During Bogata car-free day parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. There has been 118 miles of bicycle paths , which means more exercise which is good for your health.    ","Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. First the projects should be student designed, it shows more responsibility, creativity and effort. Second it gives the students' a better experience and shows different aspects of learning. Student designed projects will help the students' when they get older and move on to college and will have to do all of their work on their own.¶¶First, the projects designed by the students show tremendous responsibility, creativity and effort. The student designed projects leave the students to do it on there own; they have to worry about they want to write, what they want to prove or what they need to show. This shows the student responsibility because it's a school project over the summer that they have to complete, which most students will not even attempt to try . They will have to do the project during their own free time. And do a little of it everyday until it's complete. They can't wait last minute to do the project because it will show when they turn the project in and get a bad grade. The project show's creativity, the students or making the project and didn't get a teacher designed project. They have to come up with the whole project by themselves with only a topic to start with. The students need a creative thought process to get the project done, and in a timely manner. The project shows effort by being able to complete it and doing it right the first time, by being able to sit down and do a school project that need's to be done and you're stuck doing it during the summer. It takes a lot of effort to do a project over the summer, which is your biggest break you have off school and the most busy break for some students with sports, traveling with your family and work.¶¶Second, it gives the students' a better experience doing the project themselves and it can show different aspects of learning. It's a better experience doing it themselves because the project has to be complete by them, which is what they will have to do when they go off to college. They are not going to be able to get help from their professors' and the professors' are not going to design projects' for them in college they are going to have to learn to do it on their own. Which is a great learning opportunity for students' because it's not easy doing a project yourself and it takes practice to be able to make a good project. Doing projects can also show you different aspects of learning, By having to look up information for your project, having to do research on your topics for you to be able to complete your project. There might be some things you can't find to finish your project so you have to find valid resources, witnesses or read because you can't find anything you need on the internet, which shows a different aspect of learning because everything is on the internet nowadays.¶¶I believe student designed projects would be a better learning perspective than teacher designed projects. Students have always got assignments by teachers and have to complete them how the teachers want them completed, the projects do over the summer is a different experience there is no teacher there to tell you what to do it's all on the student, his or her views on the subject. The student can use all of the sources they find and put it into one project that wouldn't be like other class mates because they get to write about what they would like too. The teacher assigned project is not a good idea, the students will just copy and paste and can't do anything on their own. The students will have the same information because they all got the same project from the teacher. Therefore student assigned projects or better for both teachers' and students'.¶¶Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. The student designed projects are a better way for students to learn responsibility, creativity, effort and also help learn different aspects of learning for when they go off too college. Therefore projects over the summer should be student designed and not teacher designed.        ","Like the principal stated, it should be mandatory for students, at any every age, to take at least one, if not more, extracurricular activity and here's why.¶¶Students are growing, no matter if you're in kindergarten or a senior in high school, you are always growing both physically and mentally. As you grow, a lot begins to change in the world around you and extracurricular activities can help you adapt to these new changes. Your health is very important as you grow and maintaining and getting into good shape is vital to a students well being. Extracurricular activities such as conditioning, basketball, football, track, lacrosse, and other sports get you into good shape and keep you healthy. Other activities such as Shop and Home EC. teach you the necessities to life that you might not learn from anyone else. Learning to sew and cook, as well as build and repair objects, are incredibly important, especially when you buy a house, get a job, and have a family of your own.¶¶Some activities such as Chess Club and D&D Club creates a new mentality and way of thinking, allowing you to learn tactics and strategy in not only the game but also the ability to attack and solve problems in the real world at different angles. Journalism improves your writing skills as you create, edit, and re-edit your article. Journalism let's you traverse the schools grounds in search of a good story or the perfect interview to not only entertain your readers and fellow students, but also to keep them posted on current events and state of the all the things happening around them in school and it's community. Working on the yearbook immerses you into the schools community, lets you make new friendships, and create cherished memories for students and teachers to look back on for the rest of time. Such things as Homework Club let you get a jump start on homework so you can spend more time with friends and family as well as increasing the time you get to do the things you love. Math Counts and Science Olympiad keeps your brain in peak performance as you review and practice, but also learn and constantly improve your intellect and stretch your brain. Other activities, such as Debate, let you sharpen your wit, improve your ability to speak in front of an audience , advance one's argument skills, compromising skills, and working with your team to find good evidence and construct the best argument possible to defeat the opposing viewpoint.¶¶As much as these activities offer, one of the most important and crucial to students everywhere is the social experience and friends you gain. No matter what activity you participate in, you are always working with or against someone. These experiences can bring people close and let you make new friends with people you'd never met before. These people can become some of your best friends because the fact that they take that activity with you means that they probably share at least one interest with the you. I have experience with this effect myself. I live in a place where the district border of Generic_School and Generic_School, and Generic_School and Generic_School basically goes through my house. When the end of sixth grade rolled around and it was time to move on to Middle school I had a really hard time leaving. Because of this divide with the border, all the friends I had known for seven years (including kindergarten) went to Generic_School while I went to Generic_School. I had horrible anxiety and depression moving away from them, knowing I may never see some of them again and going to school that I was criminally under prepared for. Well as it turns out, my parents were much more prepared for this than I was. Years before they had signed me up for Generic_School sports instead of Generic_City sports (what all my friends did). Because I played on Generic_School lacrosse teams, basketball teams, and swim teams, I got to make a whole lot of friends from my teammates and even Generic_School athletes I had competed against. This made the transition from a place where I had spent seven years of my life with friends I had known more than half my life, to a place that I knew nothing about and barely anyone to talk to, a breeze. It was still hard to say good bye to my friends and I still didn't know many people, but the friends I had made from those sports and the new friends I made from things like D&D Club and Homework Club made middle school a fun and welcoming place.¶¶Extracurricular activities offer a lot of learning, reviewing, improvement, health benefits, social skills, organization, feelings of pride and accomplishment, helping other students, and jump start on homework, but also so much more. These activities create cherished memories and life long friends. They help you find parts of you and interests you never even knew you had. They help you find yourself and find others to help you strive along the journey of life and overcome it's most challenging obsticals.¶¶In retrospect, these activities offer so much more then what meets the eye and that's why it should be mandatory for every student at every age, to take at least one or more extracurricular activity.","Phone & Driving¶¶It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.¶¶Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.¶¶Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.¶¶Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.¶¶To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                  ","Dear Principal,¶¶Allowing students to have cell phones at school could provide an unproductive learning environment. If students are allowed to have cell phones, they could take advantage of it and use them as distractions. Also, they could get stolen or broken and then provide a lot of trouble for the school. Therefore, I believe that the school should adopt a no cell phone policy.¶¶If students were given the ability to have cell phones at school, they would then take them and use them during class as well. For instance, they might use it to text their friends or cheat on a test. This would provide a distraction from their learning that could cause them to suffer in the future. Also, many new cell phones have calculators on them which could in turn be used on a math test or quiz as an act of academic dishonesty. As a result the ability to carry cell phones at school would prove to be an unwise decision.¶¶In a case in which a cell phone were stolen or broken, it could provide a problem for the student as well as the school. If you brought a cell phone to school and it was stolen for some reason, it would cause a huge disruption. For example, the student's parents would probably be unhappy and then go and talk to the school about it. This would then cause a problem for the school and the person who stole the cell phone. Therefore, in the case of this event it would be easier just to leave the cell phone at home.¶¶Lastly, a cell phone could be used to discompose others. For example, if a person did not have a cell phone, someone else might then have reason to aggravate them or put them down. This could then cause a drop in their self esteem and prove to be very hurtful. In a similar scenario, a student might use a cell phone to upset someone else by texting or spreading rumors about others. As a result, not being able to have cell phones at school could prevent events such as this, and provide a more supportive and encouraging environment.¶¶Although some may argue that they need cell phones to contact their parents in the event of an emergency, the school would be able to provide a phone in the office that would be open to all students. Therefore, there is no case in which a cell phone would be crucial to have. Because of the distraction and complications that cell phones could cause, they should not be allowed on the school campus.¶¶Sincerely,¶¶STUDENT_NAME","In the article the author tells that even though there is alot of dangerous challenges in exploring venus and that he is willing to face them challenges. In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.¶¶In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,¶¶NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface.

There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.¶¶To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                  ","Dear Principal,¶¶Allowing students to have cell phones at school could provide an unproductive learning environment. If students are allowed to have cell phones, they could take advantage of it and use them as distractions. Also, they could get stolen or broken and then provide a lot of trouble for the school. Therefore, I believe that the school should adopt a no cell phone policy.¶¶If students were given the ability to have cell phones at school, they would then take them and use them during class as well. For instance, they might use it to text their friends or cheat on a test. This would provide a distraction from their learning that could cause them to suffer in the future. Also, many new cell phones have calculators on them which could in turn be used on a math test or quiz as an act of academic dishonesty. As a result the ability to carry cell phones at school would prove to be an unwise decision.¶¶In a case in which a cell phone were stolen or broken, it could provide a problem for the student as well as the school. If you brought a cell phone to school and it was stolen for some reason, it would cause a huge disruption. For example, the student's parents would probably be unhappy and then go and talk to the school about it. This would then cause a problem for the school and the person who stole the cell phone. Therefore, in the case of this event it would be easier just to leave the cell phone at home.¶¶Lastly, a cell phone could be used to discompose others. For example, if a person did not have a cell phone, someone else might then have reason to aggravate them or put them down. This could then cause a drop in their self esteem and prove to be very hurtful. In a similar scenario, a student might use a cell phone to upset someone else by texting or spreading rumors about others. As a result, not being able to have cell phones at school could prevent events such as this, and provide a more supportive and encouraging environment.¶¶Although some may argue that they need cell phones to contact their parents in the event of an emergency, the school would be able to provide a phone in the office that would be open to all students. Therefore, there is no case in which a cell phone would be crucial to have. Because of the distraction and complications that cell phones could cause, they should not be allowed on the school campus.¶¶Sincerely,¶¶STUDENT_NAME","In the article the author tells that even though there is alot of dangerous challenges in exploring venus and that he is willing to face them challenges. In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.¶¶In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,¶¶NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.¶¶I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. ","Dear Principal,¶¶I think you should require all students to perform community service. I think this because community service is helpful to the community, rewarding to the student, and helpful to the world as a whole.¶¶Community service is helpful to the community because it allows all members of the community to congregate and socialize while doing something beneficial for their selves. It is also helpful because the people would be making their society a better place. The people of that certain community will have an outstanding opportunity to make the place that they are living, what they would like it to be. Such things as volunteering, picking up trash, and donating can also help a community become a safer place and bring the people of that society closer together.¶¶Requiring all students to do community service is very rewarding to us students because we will know that we have done something very special. Picking up a piece of trash may seem like a simple task, but it will actually feel rewarding to us because we would know that that one piece of trash has been eliminated from our community which has eliminated a small part of the nasty dirt and grime.¶¶Community service is helpful to the world as a whole because it will make this earth a safer and cleaner place to be. Picking up trash is beneficial to us people, animals, and plants. Donating things such as clothes or food are very beneficial to those people who cannot afford those items and who are homeless. Community service can also sometimes fun; when people are having fun, they're a little bit more jolly and kind to people.¶¶Everyone should do community service at some point because it doesn't take much time, and it is very rewarding. So please require all students to do community service if you want your world to be a better place.      ",2.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,,,,,
