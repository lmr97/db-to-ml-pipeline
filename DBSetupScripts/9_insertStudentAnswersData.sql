It''s a place where people make long lasting friends and find out who they are as a person. It''s where they find out what they like, what they don''t like, what they''re good at, and what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It''s where students can find their place in the world. Thus, traditional school is much more beneficial than online school as virtual students miss out on necessary social interaction, hands on learning experiences, and extracurricular activities. By having a virtual schooling experience, students miss out on essential social exposure and interaction as well as etiquette and communication- all of which are very crucial in the world today. They miss out on their chance to make friends and important relationships that they cannot do from the comfort of their house. I used to think that soci';

He once told us that if there were two people in a room, one brilliant person with revolutionary ideas but no social speaking skills and one average person who''s sole talent is talking with others and communicating efficiently, there''s no doubt that the second person would go farther in life. Because it wouldn''t matter if someone was the smartest person in the world. That person wouldn''t go very far if they didn''t know how to communicate and exchange their ideas and interact with others. That might be a challenge that a virtual schooling experience can give it''s students. When in school, students are forced to interact among themselves, may it be during a group project or a class discussion. Both those activities help them form efficient communication and as well as leadership skills that they can''t get anywhere else';

There are many types of learners such as auditory, visual, and hands on learners. Because of this, teachers try to incorporate all these types of teaching into their lesson, the most popular type being the hands on/project based learning. If a student takes online classes, they will miss out on crucial lessons like these, especially in STEM based subjects. My favorite part in any science class is the labs. They allow me to practically apply the concepts that we learn in class to real life. I learn so much more from that experience rather than reading off a PowerPoint and taking notes. It allows me to experiment and make mistakes and become more knowledgeable by learning from those mistakes.

For many students, the best part of school is all the extracurricular activities and clubs their school has to offer. This includes a broad range of activities from sports to theater and etc. In fact, many colleges look for extracurricular and clubs and service activities rather than strictly academics. They want to see students find their passion and see what they can bring to their schools. And this is where most students shine the brightest. This where an average student can excel on a sports field or the quiet, conservative students can find their niches on stage and sing their hearts out in theater or where anyone can experience national competitions in clubs such as Model UN or Debate.

Online school would eliminate me finding my place in these clubs and the experiences and advantages I''ve gotten through it. Many people would consider online schooling as the easier option as they don''t have to commute to school everyday and they can learn all the material from the luxury of their own home.

Students who take up distance learning miss out on so many experiences, friendships, and activities that normal school has.

	clob4_pt1 CLOB := 'America''s government was inspired by the Athenian republic, therefore giving the United States  their way of governing today. In a republic government, it is said that the people of the country hold the power of electing their leaders to make decisions for their nation. In the United States of America, the presidential election is held every four years. The eligible citizens in every fifty states are granted the right to vote for their desired president. The process of which these votes are counted is called the Electoral College. The way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual''s desired candidate. Initially, the process of which the president of the United States is elected should be changed from the Electoral College to the most popular vote because it will produce a more accurate percentage of votes. In the article, ''The Indef';
	clob4_pt2 CLOB := 'ensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,'' Bradford Plumer states, ''And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.'' Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, ''What is the Electoral College?'' the Office of the Federal Register wrote, ''The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.'' This statement shows that the Electoral College ';
	clob4_pt3 CLOB := 'requires more than just the majority of citizen''s opinions. If  at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote sysytem would significantly benefit the American Society. Aditionally, the process in which the President is elected should be changed to the most popular vote because it will provide the opportunity to directly select and individual''s desired candidate. In the article, ''The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,'' Bradford Plumer quotes, ''Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.'' This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president';

The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen''s opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, ''In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,'' Richard A. Posner states, ''The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.'' This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished';

In summation, the way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual''s desired candidate.

	clob6_pt1 CLOB := 'Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn''t exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for. It states in paragraph two,'' Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas.'' This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn''t surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind. It also states in paragraph three,'' On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit';
	clob6_pt2 CLOB := ', and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.'' This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus. It states in paragraph four,''Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.'' This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth. The author then goes on to say,'' imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher al';
	clob6_pt3 CLOB := 'titude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.'' This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,'' Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.'' This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface. In conclusion the author did not convinve me that trave';

Seeking multiple opinions is a good idea because you get more input, you can combine ideas to make one super plan, and if someone knows something you don''t, then you can correct your idea and make it better. One reason getting different opinions is a good idea is because you can get multiple second opinions. The best that could happen is that you and whoever you are talking with can add so many good opinions to your ideas that you could do something great with it, like design a great video game, or develop a new medicine, or maybe make a way to keep our soldiers safe in combat. If nobody gives any good opinions, you might just get laughed at. Not a lot of bad could come out of it.

Then, you combine all the plans into one massive one- use the Trebuchets to both destroy the arrow towers and destroy the walls, taking out chunks of the wall so your troops can breach into the fortress, knocking the Pole arms off the wall (effectively killing them), and taking out the arrow towers. Now that''s good teamwork. The final reason second opinions are better than only your own is if somebody knows information that you don''t, they can provide it and you can revise whatever your idea or plan is.

Here is a reason why. All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens. Throughout the years how many have we found, none! Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms. There is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none. Look down on earth.

These activities teach you valuable things. I have come to see that most people will say that we should not be required to take extra circulars because they take too much energy away from us that could be used in school. Mostly student who are in the more active sports clubs have said this. I disagree with their claim because there are so many different types of clubs and activities you can choose from. If you find yourself having no energy to do homework because you are in the basketball club, maybe you could join the homework club and then play basketball at home with the energy you saved.

University of South Carolina of computer math conducted a survey on how many of their 4 year graduates participated in more than 3 extra circulars throughout their high school career. Over 93 percent said yes and the other 7 percent claimed they were part of a home school group. As you can see, that 93 percent definitely got the benefits from those extra circulars.

However, now we have reached a point where that reliance is harming us and our planet, and it will continue to do so if we don''t adjust our lifestyles. Seeing as that we''ve recently reached that point of realization, we are starting to limit ourselves to the things that do harm our planet, including limiting the usage of cars. Living in the twentieth century almost inevitably means relying on cars for transportation. Although it may seem impossible to convince so many to pursue this act of limiting the usage of cars, it is surely not impossible, as we''ve seen from the recent efforts made around the world. It will take time to adjust to the drastic change, but the benefits are worth the while. A few of the many advantages include, the conservation of our valuable space, improving the quality of our environment, and allowing for the opportunity of new ideas, developments, and';
	clob1_pt2 CLOB := ' change. The first of the advantages may not be the first you would think of, yet it is certainly an important one. By limiting our use of cars it would save and replenish our amount of space that we currently have available. It''s not only the cars themselves that take up space, but it is also the space left for street parking in the big cities, the massive parking garages used at shopping malls, and the driveways and garages at the houses in large suburban neighborhoods. This method of limiting the use of cars as been successfully applied to a town in Germany, known as Vauban. In Vauban, '''' [r]esidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars '''' ( '''' In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'''' ). The town of Vauban, has given up their areas of street parking, driveways, and home garages to limit--almost entirely--their use of cars. With the removal of all traces ';

Although some may be concerned with the potential limit on their car usage, they must be reminded that the space originally used for cars will certainly not go to waste, and will be used for bigger and better purposes that will not harm our planet. This second advantage is the one most associated with the limit put on our use of cars--the improved quality of the environment. The environment can be improved with the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn improves the quality of the air that surrounds us. Our President, Barack Obama, has '''' ambitious goals to curb the United States'' greenhouse gas emissions '''' ( '''' The End of Car ';

Fortunately, that cooperation has been seen with the '''' fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior '''', in which '''' recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by '''' ( '''' The End of Car Culture '''' ). It is understood by professionals, that if the pattern continues, '''' it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America''s emissions '''' ( '''' The End of Car Culture '''' ). Although some may be reluctant to pursue the path of limiting their use of cars, they should be well informed that by doing so, they are improvong their overall state of living by not producing these harmful properties that are being released into the air that we breathe.

The idea of a car-free dat has sprouted from Colombia, in which the citizens of Colombia are encouraged tohike, bike, skate, or take the bus to work rather than using cars for transportation ( '''' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '''' ). The public has responded positively to these recent changes, saying, '''' '' It''s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution '' '''', which was spoken by '''' Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife '''' ( '''' Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota '''' ).

If you''re like any regular car user, the thought ''What?! I could never survive without my car!'' may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like Vuban, Paris, and Bogota; each one has in some way restricted their people''s usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can inturn result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.

Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you''re stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in ''Paris bans driving due to smog,'' traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren''t driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skatin';

Taking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn''t cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn''t smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a ''dirty'' vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal''s article, ''In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,'' she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that ''Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, sm';

Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting ''car reduced'' communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to ''no-car driving.'' In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual ''car-free'' day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the ''smog.''

Everyone makes mistakes but in presidental elections you can''t, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely.

This isn''t fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don''t have a say.

The final reason that you shouldn''t approve or support the Electorial System is because of the ''Winners take all'' system.

''During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.'' This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote. However even in the midst of all that wrong with Electorial System people have found right in it.

We don''t know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn''t being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President.

Often times this can be due to bullying, mental disorders, or the desire to be at home with people they can trust. Children might also benefit from having one on one conversations with their teachers. In a public school, children might be nervous or scared to ask questions, give answers, or put themselves out there when they need help. An environment that makes sure a student is comfortable, will ensure that all questions are being answered. Finally, the education provided to a student at home is no different from the material public school students are learning in a classroom. Personally, distance learning seems like the perfect choice for students who have a hard time learning in a public school environment.

Children can be diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and anger issues. These problems can all stem from being in a public school. When a child is at home, they do not need to worry about the bullying as much and can focus on their school work. Being around people that make you anxious will hinder your ability to retain knowledge. All a child will think about are these people who are making them feel sad, anxious, or angry.

Being in a one on one setting can give a child a better chance at asking essential questions. Another upside to learning from a private teacher is the personal relationship that is gained. When a teacher better understands you, they have the chance to teach the way that a child needs. In a large class room, the teacher does not get the chance to teach every student individually.

This also gives the student the chance to better understand the expectations of them. The children who are taught from home are also recieving the same education, if not better. The cirriculum and subject matter is the same as what they would be learning in a public school. These children also get the opportunity to take the subject at their own pace. If they need more time digging a subject into their brains, they can get extra time.

However, this is not true as someone''s interest in something does not determine whether they will do it or not, but their work ethic is the true determining factor.

Because of the advancement of technology these days, it''s easier for educators to reach out to students and aid them in their studies online if they are not available during the operating school day. All though the internet has made education easily accessible to the privileged, it still does not equate to it being the best option for all students. In all seriousness, online school has many downsides and is not very beneficial to students, because; it eliminates the very same social settings that encourages creativity and teamwork, it tarnishes the work ethic of students, and it is not a functional learning tool for all. The at-school social setting enables creativity and builds cooperation and teamwork skills. The face-to-face aspect of in-class instruction is taken away by online school. The diff';

When students think they have been given the opportunity to ''take advantage'' of the system, they take it. Little do they know, they are harming and depriving themselves of a valuable education by being coy and timid in the class. In a real school setting, they would be easily seen and helped by their teacher without having to be shy or scared. Secondly, online school destroys students'' work ethic. The flexibility of online school will cause students to become too comfortable. Although some may argue it creates time to take care of family and at-home matters, only a small percentage of teenagers are in those desperate predicaments. Most students use this small leeway as freedom to interact with each other or find something to occupy their time with. As a result of students becoming comfortable, they push the envelope and start procrastinating. In th';

Although online school might be a perfectly acceptable way to learn and retain information for some people, for others it is simply not the case. Students with learning disabilities such as, ADD or ADHD, will find it difficult to thrive by learning at a screen for extensive hours at a time. It will also be more challenging for teachers to notice learning disabilities in students who have not been diagnosed or introduced to them. In addition, some students need hands-on experience; such learners will also struggle with learning in an online class. Face-to-face educational institutions cater to most, if not all, learning styles. Whether a student needs visuals, hands on interaction, or prefers self-written notes, obtaining and retaining information is increasingly more successful in in-school classrooms.

The students could also help their classmates through the message board and FaceTime, if one of the students has a question and the teacher can''t be contacted. The main advange to long distance learning is having the student going at thier own pace because everyone is different, everyone learns differently, some are fast learners, while others are slow learners. ';

This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

That is why they want to find out about Venus even if it dangerous. Although, Venus is a planet that we can not land on without burning. Scientist have reason on trying to find out about this planet.

For example if a small animal runs in front of your car you may hit it due to you driving so fast, and the sudden relization that an animal just ran out in front of your car. Another plus of driverless cars are you are less likely to get injured due to the computer inside your car. For example, say you are driving and you are extremely tired from a long days work. If you fall aslepp at the wheel, the car will stop due to your hands no longer on the wheel of the car, resulting in a safe stop. This is my opinion on why driverless cars would be safer.

In addition, your mind need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Thus, concentration is important while driving and breaking that concentration causes a risk for an accident. Secondly, texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well. Texting while driving can limit your response time to something like a car pulling out in front of you, a child or adult walking in front of you, and other things.

For example, the fact that the Face looked like a rock formation, the use of a different camera to show every little detail, and the point that the picture actually shows the landform which is a butte or a mesa. First off, when NASA first found the picture they unveiled the image to the public to catch their attention. The caption of the picture read ''huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'' This example shows that it looked like a human head but it was a rock formation. Second, in paragraph eleven, the author says ''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,'' he added.

Lastly, paragraph twelve states what the ''image'' was. ''What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms commond around the American West.'' This example says that what it was in reality was landform. To end this arguemnt, right now in your head you might be thinking ''Pheraps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.'' Well, that is why the NASA used a three times better camera to reassure the public of the landform.

Since we are so used to sending hundreds of texts a day, we don''t really see how it can be dangerous. However, doing so while driving could result in your life. Not only do we put ourselves and anyone in the car at risk while we text, we also endanger the other drivers on the road as well. Almost 400,000 crashes each year involve texting and driving. Many people fail to realize just how impactful texting and driving can be. ''More than 1,000 people are injured every day due to a distracted driver,'' (Texting \& Driving).

According to the article ''Driverless cars are coming'', ideas involving driverless cars have been thought of since the 1950s, but the cars have not been fully completed. For that reason, driverless cars should not continue to be developed. Having a car that does the same things you could kind of defeats the purpose of you being in the car at all, there is no point. The cars can be extremely dangerous. If you want to be safe, that means giving up things you might think you want.

They might allow the driver to take a break from driving, let the driver relax and see things without just driving for a long period of time, but they will not guarantee ones safety. If safety is wanted by everyone then driverless cars should be given up on.

The one thing holding us back from being able to discover what driverless vehicles are like is the laws that we have set in place so that a vehicle is only safe when their is a human in it driving. What they don''t consider when they makes these laws is that if everyone had a driverless car then they would all be programed to drive correctly and in sync without ever needing to worry about trusting another driver or knowing when your turn is at a intersection. The vehicles would be able to sense if the other vehicles are there and be able to decided exactly what they are spose to do without the emotions like trust and doubt cl';

Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes. Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore).

School should be a positive, motivational space, but forcing people to stay after can ruin the environment. After school activities should not be mandatory because of homework, others time, and because students may revolt. My first reason that after school activities should not be required, is because of homework. Students could struggle to find balance with school work and an extracurricular activity. They might need extra support from a teacher, but may not be able to receive it because of a conflict with their activity.

My next reason is that after school activities should not be required is because of peoples time. Some students already struggle to find time to have some fun when all they have to do is homework. Adding an activity could make it so they have no time to relax. Students don''t have to worry about getting a job or paying the bills. Students should enjoy the freedom they have while they can.

Students will be mad if they are required to do the activity, and teachers will be upset if they have to work overtime, but having to stay after school isn''t the only reason people would this way. Some people might not enjoy any of the possible after school activities, or the activities they want to do might be full. This will make them not feel obligated to the club or sport they chose.

This also means you are risking your life and someone else''s life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason. Cell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you''re going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen.

Through advancements in computer technology and communication in general, the world has become more connected than ever. One area in which improved communication has been seen is in education. Some schools have begun offering distance options for students to attend, ranging from online courses to video conferencing. Although some may disagree, these long distance options are not only a positive, but, must be expanded further. The first major benefit of distance learning is more inclusively. There are many reasons different groups of students may not be able to get the education they need face to face. For instance, students with certain disabilities may not be able to attend school. There may also be an absence of schools within reach that can properly help with their disabilities; Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to allow these students a means by which they may get their education, even if ';
	clob1_pt2 CLOB := 'they can not physically attend class. In a similar vein, there are many students who may not have physical access to schools that work for them. These students may be unable to truly get the education they need; However, with a more interconnected world students who are physically unable to may finally gain access to courses and learning styles that truly allow them to gain the education they need, and pursue their career. A group of students that is in a less dire situation, but would still benefit are people who may be absent for one reason or another. A sick day at the wrong time may severely impact a student''s grades, but may be necessary for the well being of themselves and others. By allowing temporary in-home access to school for absent students the penalty for taking the rest they need is far less. Another way in which offering long distance means of education would help is by expanding education as a field. For the most part, in terms of public education, what can be done is ';
	clob1_pt3 CLOB := 'mostly limited and far too similar; However, with the advent of long distance education far more ways of learning could be introduced for students and teachers alike. One way this could be seen is expanding the reach of schools and educational facilities as a whole. Through improved communication more schools could reach a greater number of students, helping each student find a style of learning uniquely suited for them and their needs. This could also allow teachers a greater reach, helping them find the best students and teach to the best of their abilities. Through this process both teachers and students will optimize their abilities to teach and learn respectively. Most importantly, distance learning would provide new opportunities for the field of education to expand. Having to engage with distance learning would create new obstacles; However, this adversity would provide situations in which the means of education occurs, and would force them to expand. Just as diamonds are create';

In Conclusion, recent major improvements to communication provided by the digital age would have a massive positive impact on the way in which learning is done, especially for those who can not attend school physically. Distance learning provides both a means by which the less fortunate can still receive the luxury of education and allows schools, teachers, and students to see improvements to the ways in which education as a process occurs. Some may argue that increased use of distance learning would promote absentees and hinder students abilities to learn, but innovation and inclusion are always goals to be pursued. Distance learning provides an opportunity for all students and teachers to connect and better themselves, which is a goal that must be pursued.';

Assigning projects that are teacher-designed will probably make it easier on some students because then they do not have to think about what their project could be about. They can just follow the teacher''s instructions and the rubric, if given one, and then complete the project based off the teacher''s design for it.

Some people think that it was created by aliens and others think it is just a natural landform. I think that it is just a natural landform for many reasons. I believe that the Face is a natural landform because in the 12th paragraph of the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars,'' Jim Garvin says, ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. That''s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'' The Face on Mars is actually very similar to many landforms in the American West. Now, you might say that the Face on Mars was built by aliens. But, like I said before, it is similar to many landforms we have to the west of us here in Indiana.

The truth is, they could not know what they looked like because they were not there. If we were to go back to the 1976 image and compare it to the 2001 image, what would be the difference? If you were to look at the article to the left, you could tell that the image taken in 2001 has better quality and you can see the Face more clearly. Looking back at the images side-by-side, it looks as if the 1976 has shadows cast on it and the 2001 image does not have the same shadows as the first image taken of the Face. In the last picture taken of the face, it looks less like a face because of the big role the shadows play on the first image.

As distance learning allows the student with a larger selections of classes, no social distractions in the classroom, and a learning environment where you can work at your own pace, not being compared and worried about the students around you. The first reason why distance learning is superior to physical classrooms is the fact that distance learning has a much broader selection of classes.

What else is on your bucket list? In addition, I''ve toured an excavated castle in Crete and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China! Any sea lover or animal lover should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Games are a jolly part of any off day with the team. Also, the experience is even more exciting when you bring a friend. Sure, all of the Seagoing Cowboys are your family, but a friend makes the family even closer. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is one of the most rewarding things that has ever happened to me. I believe anyone should be a Seagoing Cowboy if they want. This experience made me get a better grasp on what other countries (and not to metion the animals) need.

That year SCHOOL_NAME couldn''t participate in any games. Just like him there is other going through the same thing in school. That''s why I think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports. My first reason why I think that principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is that even if kids have a C they are trying.

Some argue that these smart cars would increase traffic efficiency and could facilitate a new age of safe motor vehicles. Others argue that we cannot place our trust regarding safety solely in a machine. The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future. Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles.

Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development, however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ''driverless car'' being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars. Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road. As of right n';

This means that someone must always be in the driver seat to ensure safety when the situation requires them to take over. This, however, contradicts the purpose of the ''driverless car.'' In addition, because the point of these cars is to drive safely without human control, people could have this in mind while in a driverless car. As a result they may give little regard to the road, and rely on the car to keep them safe and get them to their destination. Then, if they are not prepared for an alert or a need for human assistance, because they expected the car to handle it, their dependency on the car put their safety at risk. The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, '' who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?''

Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry. If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don''t need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits.

If every single student will do an extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to the school day, which I know would not go over well with many.

Even if that isn''t the case, if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher''s already limited teaching time. If we only have 45 minutes per class right now, imagine how little it would be adding another period. Educators would be in a constant struggle to cram enough information in such a short class time.

Allowing and giving the students a place where they can spark new interests and express themselves can have a tremendous boost to their mental health along with their self-esteem because of the environment they placed themselves in, and the fact that they can express themselves. A recent study done in Harvard, said, ''93% of students that participate in extracurricular activities are 86% happier with themselves and others because the students are given a chance to express themselves, and feel safe from expressing themselves''.

According to a professor from Yale, ''Students with a good mental health do better in school because the students worry less and have a more positive mindset''. Both of these studies prove how beneficial it can be to assign the responsibility to every student of having to maintain an extracurricular activity because in the long run the students will be happier both with themselves and others, and have a better education, along with a stronger mindset. Students having to preform extracurricular activities can create new friendships, and bonds with people. An example of this would be if a student named Generic_Name was really into football and equally talented to the amount of love he has for the sport.

Another reason that supports the thesis of extracurricular activities creating friendships is from a study recently done in Northern Virginia, from the University of Marymount. According to a professor named Albert Finkilstein, ''more then two thirds of people with similar interests become friends because of the mutual interests both parties share''. Albert Finkilsteins research proves that the extracurricular activities can sprout new friendships among the student population of Generic_School. However, a very important effect that pieces together why is is so important for friendships to be made is that students with more friends have a stronger education. According to a study done in Callasbases Florida, ''nearly 80% of students that have friends and are able to ask questions, share emotions with, and lastly feel comfortable with have a stronger education because students can rely on their friends for help with homework because students ';

Overall, with creating friendships from the extracurricular activities comes a stronger education, more people to rely on, and overall a better high school experience because of the friendships made and the comfortability made from creating those friendships. Forcing students to have to be able to balance school work along with an extracurricular activity can be very helpful in the idea of making students have to learn how to maintain efficient time management skills along with being more productive.

From how strict the school is with their grades it seems that they are very productive and efficient since they only expect 110% all the time. However, it is easy to slip up or possibly fall behind and the best way to keep the productiveness flowing and for the students to do their homework every night is to never stop being productive which is why having an extracurricular activity is very beneficial because it helps teach all of the students how to maintain productiveness and how to have good time management skills.

Overall, having extracurricular activities can help students expand on being more productive, being able to have good time management skills, and space things along with being able to maintain such things. The strengths and effects that can be created with the idea of students having to maintain and participate in extracurricular activities are improving students mental health, students creating friendships with one-another, and lastly, the idea of students having to learn to balance extracurricular school activities with school work along with learning how to create more efficient time management skills and being more productive. ';

In fact cleaner air is so desired and necessary that some countries, including the U.S., are now turning it into law. Over in Vauban, Germany, most residents do not own cars, and alternatively ride their bicycles wherever they may need to go. The way that they made this possible was making sure that there were only two places to park - large garages at the end of the development.

Over in Paris, with a near-record pollutuion rate, people are fined for using cars by license plates, meaning on Monday a motorist with an even-numbered license plate would be fined 22 euro, whereas on the following day this would apply to odd-numbered license plates.

Another case where distant learning may come in use is for students very involved in sports. Doing a sport can be a big responsibility. Sports are very time consuming, although some athletes make it look easy, there is a lot that goes into playing. Many levels of sports may require leaving the state or country for days, sometimes even weeks. While playing a sport it is easy to be injured or become sick. Furthermore, students are loosing class time and unable to make up for missed days in little time. Distant learning would be beneficial for those who travel so they can take their school work along and manage their free time.';

Today in society people do not realize how much cellphones have affected the way people drive. It is and it has been a danger for a while now. There are many dangers due to the use of cell phones most people do not realize that they really are. To begin with, the majority of car accidents that happen everyday are usually caused by people who are using their cell phones while driving. They tend to use their cell phone while being on the road thinking they can multitask when in reality they can''t. People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else''s life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it''s not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.

Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life. To tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license.

The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth.

The first person people should ask should be a trusted adult because you know they can trust them, and finally everyone should always ask more than one person because they might get a better outcome from someone elses advice.

In a way that story was kinda related to my next claim about always ask a trusted adult first cause if i had asked my mom in the first place none of this would of happend. Another reason everyone should always ask a trusted adult first is it could be personal.

Actually, there is an option like that. Some schools offer the option of allowing students to attend school online by video conferencing or by being in an online class. This has sparked a debate with people wondering whether this option of taking online classes is beneficial to students or not. One side of the argument says that taking online classes is beneficial because it''s convenient and there will be less negative social interactions between students. The other side of the argument states that students taking online classes is not beneficial because students will have less social interaction all together and because technology shouldn''t be relied on so much when it comes to an education.

Meeting people and making friends is one the key aspects of going to school, besides getting an education, and students and kids need to be meeting people and learning how to interact with others. Humans are social creatures, we need to be talking, seeing, and meeting with people. If kids are built on rarely communicating with others, then there will be a higher chance of them being more socially anxious as young adults. Another reason why a student that goes to school online will not have their social needs met is because they won''t experience arguments as much.

Lastly, people going to an online school will not get the same social interaction from teachers. While students that go to school have a teacher that is physically there to help, online students do not.

Accidents happen, but while the laptop is getting fixed the student will most likely start to fall behind on work. An accident shouldn''t be a reason for someone beginning to fail a class. Another reason why technology is limited is because of internet and wifi. Some students may not have access to good internet and wifi because of their home and living situation, this will just make video conferencing more of a hassle than a helpful.

Some people may argue that online classes are good for students because of lack of negative interaction and its convenience. Bullying and fights can really harm students, I agree with that statement. But learning behind a computer screen shouldn''t be the solution we choose. We can try to improve the school system or promote telling teachers and trusted ones if someone is getting bullied. Just because there is negative interaction doesn''t mean we should limit interaction entirely. Also, the convenience not going on the school bus everyday and walking through loud hallways is compelling.

This is a major issue since drivers are usually on their phones all the time.

Throughout the country, some schools have worked to make this a reality, offering students the option of ''distance learning'', which is a means by which students can take classes from home through online or video conferencing. In the 21st century, technological development is playing an increasingly larger role in several aspects of society, including educational institutions. The question of how and to what extent these innovations should be integrated serves as a subject for debate. Distance learning should not be an option for all students as it does not induce the same motivation as does a classroom setting, it creates the possibility for students to take advantage of the freedom, and students would not be given the chance to develop certain social skills necessary for their success in the real world.

However, at school, academic competition among peers allows for students to push themselves outside of their comfort zone, achieving their highest potentials. Additionally, the motivation of a student who takes classes from home is less than that of a student in a classroom as students at school are more exposed to the opportunities that other students have taken advantage of, such as sports and extracurriculars.

Beyond this, distance learning allows for students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which undeniably serve as a distraction to their academics. For example, at home, a student may be tempted to watch television, or take a nap as there is no teacher or administrator to effectively enforce certain rules and guidelines on the student. This situation makes a student''s ability to stay on task extremely difficult, hence negatively impacting that student''s success academically. However, if the student were taking classes at school, they are required, by the teacher, to focus on the lesson and complete tasks in a timely manner for their grade.

At school, students can also ask their peers for help or advice on assignments. These opportunities at school sculpt a student''s ability to develop imperative inter-personal skills, while promoting sociable behavior among students. Through distance learning, however, a student is not exposed to these situations; therefore, they are unable to make the same connections and develop these skills necessary for college or the real-life situations.

One of the most important reasons why students should be able to bring their phones to school is if they miss their bus and they have to contact a parent or guardian. Or if they are involved in any after school activities like sports or clubs they would have to contact someone to get them when what ever they are doing is over. They are also great to have if there was ever an emergency. A good reason for letting them use their phones during free periods is they could find where their friend is and sit together. Or they could ask each other homework questions and help each other. Those are just some of the many reasons why students should be aloud to have their cell phones with them. sincerely, a concerned student',EMPTY_CLOB(),EMPTY_CLOB(),EMPTY_CLOB(),EMPTY_CLOB(),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

	clob1_pt1 CLOB := 'Consequences for texting and driving. In recent years there have been many studies conducted on how texting while driving is dangerous and the negative outcomes that usually happen. I believe nobody should operate a cell phone in any capacity while driving. One reason that you shouldn''t use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you aren''t considering other motorists. If you''re too busy texting or talking you become distracted and you aren''t concentrated on the road anymore. So many car accidents are caused by texting and driving. According to Georgia''s driving statistics there are 3287 deaths each day from distracted driving. Texting and driving is illegal in the state of Georgia. On July 1st 2018 they made a law and it says ''all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state is prohibited from holding or supporting...'' you know it''s a pretty serious situation if the entire state of Georgia made a law about it. Texting and driving also set bad exampl';

You don''t want to text and drive in front of them because they may start to think that''s the right thing to do. Kids tend to mock behaviors that they see others doing and if the mock the texting and driving habit those type of accidents will never stop. Due to texting and driving teens are 400 percent more likely to get into an accident. Teen drivers being distracted by cell phones is the number one killer in teenage deaths. With teens being so inexperienced with driving they need a completely focused and structured driving zone so that their full attention is on the road and nothing else. Did you know that texting and driving slows your reaction time? Researchers at Texas A\&M transportation conducted a ''how your reaction time is affected'' project. The normal reaction time without any distractions was one to two seconds, when you''re texting and driving the';

You may think ''oh whatever four to five'' seconds isn''t enough time to cause any damage'' and in reality, if you''re not paying attention for one second a lot can go wrong especially behind the wheel. Finally, one accident and your insurance goes sky high. Why would you want to pay money for something this is preventable? Texting and driving is pretty easy not to do. If you feel like you absolutely can''t keep your hands off the phone there are tips to help with that. One thing you could do is put It inside of the glover department so that you can''t reach it. One last tip that you could so is have a passenger (if you have one) to hold your phone so you can''t get to it. Now think about it...is texting and driving worth it? All the things that could go bad if you are distracted and driving should encourage you to drive distraction free.

I think this is a great idea and a step into the technology of the future. One reason why this system is great is it can show you exactly what emotions someone has. The system constructs a 3-D model of the face on the computer. It then compares the face to a face that is showing no emotion. The system then looks at your 44 muscles in your face to see how you are feeling. The system can even detect mixed emotions. Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois is the creator of this system and he says this about the system, ''By weighting the different units, the software can even identif';

Gettng these results can now tell us what painters from a long time ago were thinking about in there art when they painted it. This can be very useful in figuring out more ideas from artists in the rennisance age. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a great tool that can help out the future of emotions greatly.

Another  reason why you should change the voting rules is that the Electoral College doesnt even work. In the article it explains how''''under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presedent ,but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.''''This quote explains that the electoral college has nothing to do with the people the vote is not decided by the people why have any people to begin with.

Here''s why i think people should not use a cellphone while driving. Using your phone is already a distraction and driving just makes it more worse than it is. While driving you have a lot responsibilities and using a phone just makes it harder to focus. Using a phone while driving is also probably illegal. In certain cases it is highly likely that you will receive a ticket. You can easily save yourself a ticket by just waiting till you are out of the vehicle reply to a text or call.

A main reason can be a emergency. Sometimes things happen at unfortunate times while you are driving, but that still is no excuse for you to use a phone while driving. Maybe waiting at the light to reply can sometimes be okay as long as you are paying attention. If you need to call or answer a call you can maybe put the phone on a mount so that your hands are still on the wheel and you still have your focus on the road. I personally know people who do this and in my opinion it''s the safest way to answer the phone hands free while all your attention is still on the road.

If the software can be used to detect the emotions on the faces of students, it can identify the emotions associated with success and frustration. If the facial scan sees that a student is struggling wi';

For students are exceeding the requirements for the assignment, emotions of happiness could allow for students to face a challenge with tougher problems than the ones given previously. As seen in the paragraph above, FACS can aid in online learning, but it can also help with emotional help provided by a school counselor. Though it is a profession that entails the analysis of emotion in teenagers, emotions can be tough to read for even the most experienced in the field. FACS could play a big role in identifying what emotions students might have in the name of betterin';

Talking through these problems can lead to a more positive outlook on life and could allow for more engagement academically regarding the student. As a whole FACS can improve school life and culture. Lastly, FACS can play a large role in the education of Anatomy, not only in high school, but in college as well. Paragraphs 7-9 provide simple examples of muscles involved in movements that indicate emotions from the zygomatic major and risorius to the orbicularis oculi pars plpabraeus.

FACS can help memorize those muscles and retain knowledge about their function from a simple facial analysis. An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, aid in school counseling, and aid in learning Anatomy. As explored in the paragraphs above, FACS provides a wide range of oppurtunities for schools to engage in different forms of learning and measuring progress with its aid.

It is important that you ask for other people''s opinions when you need help making a decision.

The choices we make each day affect our lives going forward and for our own sake, we need to make better choices. Getting advice from multiple people can help you to avoid personal bias, see from new perspectives, and get help from qualified people. When being tasked to make an important decision, it is important that you avoid personal bias and take other people''s ideas and thoughts into account. People with biased minds often already have a decision in mind before making a decision and usually will not change their mind.

Finally, allowing your mind to be clouded and biased will not help you make a better choice. Asking for advice or opinions from others can help you see from a new perspective. When viewing a decision from others opinions, you may learn new information and realize things that you had not before. When I make a decision, I ask my parents, siblings, and friends for advice because I want to see what type of lens they are viewing my decision from.

Getting advice from other people can help when making a decision because they may be more knowledgeable or experienced on a topic. It is important to listen to these people because they have a better understanding on the possible outcomes, pros, and cons. Conversely, you should take the advice of someone who is less knowledgeable or is less experienced on a topic into account less.

The advice of more qualified people should be searched for when trying to make the best choice. Each day you make hundreds of choices and each choice you make effects more than just yourself. They effect your parents, siblings, peers, etc. It is important that we all try to make the best choice possible each day.

These driverless cars have multiple, negative aspects that outweigh the positives, including a major precaution, saftey. They also take away from the driving experience, and add to the dependency on technology. First of all, the article enters with ''Google cars aren''t truly driverless.'' This shows how driverless cars are not even at the level of functioning alone without the driver being alert, defeating the purpose of the ''driverless'' car since a human would always have to be present in case something went wrong. Something that manufactures attempted to do was to have ''smart-road systems'', but they ''required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.'' This proves that the costs for the modified roads would be too much to fit the driverless car''s needs, s';

Later, it describes the multiple sensors and states ''the combination of all this input is necesary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.'' This proves that the costs would probably increase due to the new technology as well as the variables that could go wrong increases as the amount of new sensors increase. All of the senors could not mimic the skill of the humans because everything can be constantly changing, from the condition of the roads to the weather. Others might argue, ''Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own,'' however, manufacturers are not at that point of high level saftey and can never guarentee one hundred percent safety. Furthermore, driverless cars can ''steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all ar';

''The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' ''This necesitiates the car being ready to quickly get the driver''s attention whenever a problem occurs.'' This illustrates how unsafe the driverless cars would be. Any mishap to a sensor or system control could result in terrible consequences. Since the cars would be using new technology, it would be unreliable, because technology tends to fail often. This failure could result in injury or even death, a risk that people should not take. In addition, not only are the cars unsafe, but they also prevent drivers from having fun while driving or getting the full experience.

To account for these new cars, laws would have to change. ''If traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident,'' adding to the trouble of making these cars a possibility and possible conflicts that could arise. When asked in the articule, ''If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer,'' this question highlights the position that driverless cars should not be developed. When describing the production of these cars, manufacturers are all about technology. However, technology is bound to fail at times and can be flawed, especially in the beginning process.

Due to saftey factors, technology failure, costs, and possible liability issues, driverless cars should not be produced. There are too many risks that could go wrong due to a system malfunction. Humans should not need to be dependent on technology in order to drive. Driverless cars could not replace a human dealing with everyday, constantly changing driving conditions and unexpected events.

Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college.

Should they change their mind on who they want to vote, or should they be paid in someway, they could defy the will of the greater people who have voted for them.

By not providing evidence of some sort of pregression or steps closer to considering sending humans to Venus, the author weakens his arguments over the better outcomes of conducting research.

Lastly, modern day technology is known for its speed and cinvenience to access information. In paragraph 7, the author discussed how electronics we simplified to last at least three weeks in simulating conditions to Venus. He explained, ''modern computers...tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physicakl conditions.''

A common misconception is that limiting car use is solely beneficial to the environment. In paragraph three a resident of Vauban is quoted saying, ''When I had a car I was always tense.

In attempt to clear record breaking amounts of smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban and it worked. This shows that by limiting car use change can be made to our environment for the better. Without using a car, one would clearly need to find an alternative method of transportation. Common alternatives such as biking or walking spark a much more active lifestyle for those who do so.

A cell phone definitely comes in handy in some everyday situations, but is it necessary to use it in school when all of the tools that you need are handed to you? These are questions that most students don''t really ask themselves. They complain about not being able to use their phone in school, but why do they need to use it? So does a cell phone immediately turn into a distraction as soon as it hits a school campus? Now, I''m as much of a kid as the next guy, and I use my cell phone probably just as much, but I''ve never needed it in a school situation unless I was just plain lazy. People say that they wouldn''t use their cell phone to text in school, but to use it as a resource.

Another argument might be that they need to call/text their mom to inform her of something that''s extremely important.

Second, sports are good for you because they keep you in shape. But there is something else, if you want to go to college or have a decent job in your future, then grades are more important.

I know you were a kid once, so bring it to the kids realization that grades are more important. You need to put forth some effort, and they will too.

This doesn''t mean that there are downsides to this decision but exceptions could always be made if needed. I agree with the decision to make participation in at least one extracurricular mandatory because it is important to branch out and be apart of something, it gives students more to learn and more to do for themselves, but it does come at the price that some students are not able to do extracurricular activities for certain reasons.

A student may not have the money to buy all the personal equipment they need for a sport, or the transportation to and from the activity, or they simply have too much on their plate, like babysitting a younger sibling. A good solution to these issues is to have it discussed with a guidance counselor to find a way to fix these problems.

This new rule is intended to help students in the long run as this will make it easier to develop new and exciting skills for themselves to use. It helps them develop social skills and be apart of something big and they learn new things for themselves.

The first reason is because, as a kid we don''t like being forced to do things. Yes, it''s good to give a child a push at something so they can try a new thing and maybe it will be apart of their future; but if a principle or person forces it on them it may stop the child from doing it ever again.

By allowing students the option to choose their learning environment then it lets students decide whether they learn best from the comfort of their own home, a classroom, or anywhere else.

When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other car-users. According to source 1 on car-free cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ''Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States'' (Rosenthal, paragraph 5';

'' Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by''(paragraph 29). Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. '' Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France'' (Duffer, paragraph 14). Also in source 3 describing Bogota''s Car free day is spreading to other countries of Latin-America with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Although it is almost certain that this idea was proposed with good intention, the red flags that come with it are far too many to ignore. Students would not benefit from attending class at home because they would not have a concrete form of direct guidance, there wouldn''t be a rigid structure of routine in their learning experiences, and students would undergo a significant lack of human interaction in their everyday lives. Firstly, if distance learning was to take place, students would not have a concrete form of direct guidance to assist them throughout their school curriculum.

It is impossible to achieve the same dynamic of instruction and comprehension when learning virtually. When comparing distance learning students and in-school learning students, the in-school students are definitely reaping the most benefits. Secondly, if students were to attend classes at home, there wouldn''t be the same rigid structure in their learning experience.

The reasoning for this being that the lack of structure in their everyday learning becomes detrimental to the student''s chances of success in the class. Distance learning students would not benefit from attending class from home because the lack of structure and routine in their day is enough damage done.

Without interaction from their peers, distance learning students will end up conflicted in instances like work scenarios in the very near future. This is a problem that can be avoided with the simple elimination of all suggestions leaning towards virtual learning. In conclusion, the topic of distance learning is controversial.

This technology, created by Professor Thomas Huang, ''calculates'' the emotions displayed on the face of the user of the computer, and was said to encourage learning and help the boredom and other emotions often felt by humans when learning.

This quote describes to the reader the advancements of this technology, and just how unique the technology is in its intelligence.

This special software is very important to students because it could very well increase their chances of success in the classroom. ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'' (Paragraph 6). This quote gives the reader more information about how helpful this computer software could be in a learning environment, by being able to keep the learner''s attention on the knowledge they are consuming.

The technoloical devices at schools in this day and age just seem inferior to the kind of learning one can get via this advanced software created by Dr. Huang. ''Your home PC can''t handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa''s smile,'' (Paragraph 7).

Consulting multiple people for ideas and suggestions allows one to have an open mind when considering every different method. This can be evidenced by my own experience.

Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others.

From Washington to Obama we have always elected our leaders as such. The Constitution has given us our way to vote- the Electoral College. This process, of course, consists of our 538 electors, the place where they meet to vote, and the counting of said votes. But how effective is this process? Honestly, I believe the Electoral College should be diminished. Statistics show that direct voting is preferred by the majority of the citizens in the U.S.. According to a poll taken in 2000, 60% of voters would rather direct voting over the current system. With the current '' winner-take-all '' concept in most all states except Maine and Nebraska, many people find that even if 45% of all the votes in the state are for one party, all of the votes go to the opposition. Citizens may as well not even vote under this standard if they wont';

With that 1.4 million, mixed with tons of thousands of voters, one party may actually win the election rather then the canidate who would have won with the Electoral College process. For example, in 2000, George W. Bush won the election and most of the Electoral College votes. However , Al Gore got the most individual votes. How can that be fair at all? When ''we the people'' vote for the president, we are not actually doing what we have come to believe. In reality, we are actually voting for representatives called Electors to vote for the canidate. These electors cast their vote depending on the votes that we (you and I), cast. These electors that we choose are generally very trustworthy and reliable, being the reasons we ';

To wrap up, I vote that we abolish the Electoral College and allow the citizens of the United States to vote for ourselves. It would make the majorty of the U.S. happier, it will make us better represented, and we will be directly electing our own government officials.

The author presents details as to why Venus is a challenge to explore by giving descriptions on its envrionment. In paragraph 3, the article states ''...Venus has the hottest surface temperature on any planet in our solar system...'' and ''...planet''s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...''

This demonstrates the complication as to why spacecrafts have a hard time landing on Venus to explore, which is weather and environmental factors impose a threat to damaging the spacecraft. The author in the article helps support his idea by giving reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet Venus. In paragraph 4, it states ''Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.''

This exclaims that since Venus is not that far away to travel to compared to other planets, it cuts down space travel time which is beneficial to humans since they cannot live hundreds of years. The author continues to supports his ideas by proposing plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications. In paragraph 5, it says ''... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.'' This example provides information on how a hovering vehicle would help astronauts to avoid the environmental factors making it easier to explore Venus by aerial view.

They have spent years learning all about politics so the ''most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.''(paragraph 20) In paragraph 16 it says ''But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party''s nominee.'', also meaning that the people we select to represent us is trusted people that will have the same vote as you for the desicion of president.

I see all kinds of texting in my class that teachers don''t know about because kids know how to hide them.

But since we aren''t allowed to use our phones in school we have to wait until we get home or on the bus. Well by that time most of us have already forgotten the question. So we never know the answer. One final reason is suppose a kid gets sick. Most kids don''t like to go to the nurse''s office. I know I don''t. So if the kid can wait until lunch or his free time he can then call his parents to come get him so he doesn''t have to stay at school sick. At my school if you get sick and you don''t want to go to the nurse you are stuck at school. No matter how bad you feel. You can ask the teachers if you can call your mom but they always ask why.

The fun in the project spurs the student to learn more for the project and with luck, continue to research and look up facts own their own, without the need of a project to guide them forwards. Teachers are incapable of filling the need of unique projects for each student.

Summer projects should be student-designed because people work better with ideas they''re familiar with, this gives students more freedom with subjects for a project, and students are more willing to do something they want to do or research. When working on projects, its easier to work with something you''re familiar with than anything else. Making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. They''d also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn''t always give you ';

Familiarity with your work makes it come to you naturally and having the freedom to choose the subject of a project is important. Being able to choose what you''re working with will make a project more enjoyable. Most of the time, teacher-assigned projects would have all the students doing or researching the same thing. While this makes the assignment easier to grade and gives everyone a common goal, some people want to look somewhere else. Choosing your subject could bring about interesting results and give you a new interest rather than just being given the generic science project where you monitor and grow a small plant for x amount of time. Working on something you, personally, picked out could also inspire you to put more work into the assignment. Being willing to do your work helps greatly with work ethic ';

Students would be able to enjoy looking up information on subjects interesting to them and put them on paper. They''d be able to turn in a well-written paper and get a good grade just for researching a fun subject. In conclusion, having students create their own summer projects would be highly beneficial towards productivity on said project. The benefits outweight the negatives and more students would work harder on these projects. Being limited to certain ideas will make it so students don''t try as hard to think outside the box. This type of work also helps students find things they''re interested in for later.

These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals.''

This piece shows that some scientists want to explore Venus for its ancient possible ability to explore life, but the author needed to support his claim with other information, other than strictly in this paragraph. Ultimately, the author did have evidence in his article, but there needed to be more in order to make his claim well-supported and also more credible.

NASA has a ''particularly compelling idea'', for sending humans to study Venus, as the reader may notice from the text. We are told that Venus may have some interesting things being discovered that may lead to new studies. It''s dangerous and takes caution, but is it worth it? As the reader can tell from the text, the author states mutliple reasonings for why it would be worth it for humans to do such studies on Venus. One of those might be for the fact that Venus is often reffered to as Earth''s ''twin.'' This is because Venus is the closest planet to Earth within being of terms in density and size. Plus, it''s super close to Earth so it''s one of Earth''s closest ''neighbors.'' It''s found within the text also that Venus may have contained bodies of water such as Oceans and who knows, maybe lakes here and there. Due to the planets'' surface of rocky sediment, i';

It''s definitely a work in progress due to temperatures going to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Surviving human lives on Venus wouldn''t be easy due to these conditions but that is why NASA is digging deeper into what can be done to make it suitable for human lives. Though one other thing shared with the reader is that the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, which is a holdback but it''s of course possible for adaptation in the right conditions which need to be discovered. If it''s possible that other forms of life lived on Venus then why not humans too? The third reason for studying Venus being worthy is that human curiosity can lead to an endorsement ';

Which leads to the idea that if we can figure out how and why our bodies function in certain conditons on Earth, how could and would our bodies function on a planet that is closest to features alike the sun. These reasons explain to the reader why the author might believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers; because, who else is to make these discoveries and what if NASA were to find information that could help us learn a bit more about our own planet. Plus, more about the human life can be something that we learn more and more about. And lastly, who''s to say that curoisity killed the cat?

	clob3_pt1 CLOB := 'There are several different benefits of limiting car usage. Diesel fuel from cars tend to polute the air, so the less people use cars the less air pollution there will be. People will walk more than they did before with the limitations of car usage. The roads will also have less ''congestion'' or car traffic. These benefits are very helpful in many ways as to why car usage should be cut back for a while. Over the years, air pollution has become a big problem everywhere. It basically poisons us with the air we breathe. When you have restrictions or limitations on car usage, it will help a lot because the less toxis chemicals you have in the air, the healthier it is for everybody, and the more safer the environment is. Another benefit of limiting the car usage is people will walk more than they ever had before. For example, you usually don''t walk unless you really have to, like when you''re going shopping, walking a dog, or walking in school. But when you have a car and you''re trying t';

When you live in over-populated areas, congestion happens a lot. Congestion in this situation means car traffic. Congestion is very time consuming sometimes because the more traffic there is, the less time you have to complete a task you were planning on doing. Less cars on the road is a very good benefit to limitating car usage, a benefit to time, and a benefit to people on every level. These are some of the benefits of limiting car usage.

Getting good advice can sometimes be a challenge, so asking more people is probably a better choice then only asking one person. Looking for advice from multiple people apposed from one person is better because it shows multiple views of the topic, gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work, and includes different experiences of the topic. Getting multiple views on the topic clears up that there is not any bias coming from a persons advice. What is a bias? Bias is a positive or negative opinion that someone has to an object, place, or person. Bias is not good for giving advice because it sometimes can shows a wrongful or untrue statement about the topic. Multiple views also gives the person more then one way to handle the topic and use different approaches to the situation. An example of bias is views on a person. One person might t';

Another person might be their best friend and say they are amazing, but both of these opinions are biased because of the way they have interacted with the person. It would be best to find a third party opinion who does not have a biased thought towards the person. The next reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person is it gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work. Two people might give the same advice, but give different reasons on how it will work. This can show a variety of knowledge on the concept and give even more ways to approach the situation. In conclusion, asking more people for advice is more knowledgeable because of the different reasons people give for why their own advice will work. The last way getting multiple peoples advice is better is that different people have different experiences. This means that people have had a scramble of atmospheres of the topic. It mostly';

Both of the people went to the water park and had different experiences on how it went. It was really just their personal preference and the only way is to go to it yourself to see how it is. Receiving multiple people for advice is shown to be better then just asking one person because multiple views on the topic clears up any biased that a person has, a greater understanding of the topic because the different reasons on why they advice will work, and multiple experiences that people have had show a variety thoughts when going to a place.

All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. Summer assignments should be student-designed so those students can take interest in their study and make learning fun. Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book work from the class they don''t like. Projects like research papers, essays, and 20+ page packets can drown students for the months they have off.

Students designing their own summer projects will interest them more in the topic, as well as transform the summer project from a burden to something students want to complete. Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning. Those history packets would be much more involving to me if they had to do with the World Wars or Military history, and even more if they involved some sort of project component.

Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year. The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading and assessing their work. The more freedom students are given within a project, the further projects are going to be from what a rubric wants, which can be a pain for teachers.

For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.

Schools must enforce a level of complexity to the project to ensure that the projects are of equal effort. For example, a student can not call watching television their passion. It is important to acknowledge all types of interests but giving students free range on a summer assignment could result in laziness or incomplete work.

For example, a couple of people coul''ve said the same thing over whatever someone else might have said and that could help base your decission by knowing more people said the same thing than having different answers. Seeking advice from multiple people could help you because you could get different views on why or why not, it could help lead to a better decission by asking them, it could make you a more responisble person. Getting different views on a decissions could not only be helpful but reliable by knowing everyone elses opinion and if you can agree or dissagree with it. For example, say you want pizza, but you want either pepperoni or cheese. You ask your friends and three of them say peppe';

Asking different people can help lead to a better decission than what you were planning on doing. For example, have you ever wanted to do something but didn''t know if it was going to be the right choice to make. In that case what do you do? You ask your friends or other people and everyone is disagreeing with your choice and it help you to realize what the better choice could be. Prefferably it could''ve been the safer option or more responsible one so then after you say what a relief it is to know I made the better choice. Therefore, it helps you to realize the better or worse choices you could or could''ve made. Another good reason is';

By aksing multiple people about choices to make or which one to choose could also help you be a better person or become more responsible.

By this I mean, what if your parents asked you a question and you didn''t know if you should answer truethfuly or lie. You didn''t get anyone elses opinions on it which could possibly and most likely lead to a better choice but you choose to lie. This is where you could loose trust on your parents knowing your not responsible enough to tell the truth. This could possibly be the case and this is why asking for multiple opinions could lead to a better response and could make you a more responsible person.

It can make your decission more reliable by knowing you have different opinions on your choices and build trust by being honest in an example I put in the last paragraph. The more improtant thing that can help is it helps you realize that that choice was better instead of another choice. Although, just because a choice has more votes make sure you agree because it''s possible for the choices to not all be the best ones. That''s why it''s always important to always make sure you have your opinion invloved and not just someone elses opinion.

The Electoral College is a winner-takes-all system, meaning that candidates spend lots of time campaigning in the ''swing'' states rather than others. In 2000, seventeen states didn''t even get to see the candidates. This means that almost 34% of voters didn''t get a real feel for who they will be casting their votes for.

In 1960, Louisiana legislature segregationists almost replaced all of the Democratic electors electors with new Kennedy-opposing electors. The errors and problems in this system could be much greater, and goverment officials must be monitoring it at all times.

Phones today are mostly used with teenager behind the wheel and there has been many accidents of teenagers using their phones while driving. Phones theses days cause many distractions while driving but that is their choice to pull out their phone while driving. So in my opinion i think we should have our phones while driving,so now let me explain why. Phones,Now a days we use phones for many other things other than calling.

Conclusion,in my opinion everyone doesn''t need to have a phone while driving but no one is going to make a law saying we shouldn''t have a phone while driving. It''s just not gonna happen because it would not be a suitable law to create when everyone around the whole world has phones and use them while driving.

It can help them pick up their grades. It is also a good consequence to show that without good grades, you are not allowed to play. The policy of removing those with low grade average off their sports team is a good idea, because it helps your student stay on track and pick up their grades. Being excused from a sport event due to grades, can show the student that he or she needs to spend less time practicing with the team and more time getting better grades.

Many of you may agree with my opinion about this policy, but I know some of you may have some concerns. Maybe one of these concerns is that your student won''t proceed with getting good grades.

How is it fair to Americans, if you say we have a vote that counts when we are just voting for a slate of people that might vote for someone we do not want. The voting process needs to be handled by the people, and who we want to run this country that we live in. The voting process is just not fair to Americans. It''s in the constitution that we have a right to vote and that we have the right to choose our president, but you people in the electoral college take away that right when we only get to vote for a slate of people. If elections were done by popular vote things might have been different in many ways. First off, in the 2000 election if it was done by popular vote, Bush would not have won and we would have had, Al Gore as president. The electoral college is just uncompletely fair to voters.

There is not a reason to vote when the electoral college votes fore us. Yes, sometimes people do not know what they are voting for and why, but that is because we have no say, it is not up to the people who is going to the president of the country of we live, because the electoral college will not let us choose who we want. Many people, very important people, such as Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and the U.S Chamber of commerece have agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College and give the people the vote and see who wins president then.

I get it that there are more people in some states than others, but that does not mean we all get the same number of electoral votes as the huge states such as, California, Florida, and Texas. So if we are not going to have the same votes number of votes no matter what why does it matter if we give the people the option and have them vote for who they want, it is because the Electoral College does not care who we want they choose the president on who they want.

	clob5_pt1 CLOB := 'It is important for students to continue developing their minds and knowledge over summer break, but I think it is even more important for them to do so by doing something that intrigues them. During the school year, students are constantly pressured to do assignments that aren''t of their interest, which commonly leads them to procrastinate the assignments and their desire to do any work drops. Summer break is an escape for students nationwide; teachers should allow them to have that time to be stress-free, to have fun, and to enjoy everyday to the best of their ability. I believe that if students were to have to do a summer project it should be student-designed for these three reasons: (1) there is no reason for a student to learn about something that doesn''t interest them over their break, (2) a student should not be stressed or confused about school work over break, and (3) the student''s mind would develop more by giving them the freedom to use imagination and creativity to desig';

And while teachers assign that work in order to give the students the information they need for standardized testing, there is no reason for them to give the students work that fits that curriculum over summer break. As a student in high school, it is quite common to hear students, and even teachers, say that the topics we have to learn about will be useless in our everyday lives as adults. As I implied before, summer is supposed to be an escape from the constant memorization of information for the next big test. A student-designed project over the summer would continue the education of the students, but in a way that allows them to learn about and work on a topic that they find interest in. Although there are other things that could stress out a student over summer break, one of those stresses should never be schoolwork. Many don''t realize it, but the';

Situations like this leave students to worry; in my opinion, students shouldn''t have to go through that during their time off. By giving them the opportunity to create their own project and decide what they will be spending their time working on, the chances of the students becoming stressed over the assignment would be lower than if the teacher were to design the project and give them certain criteria to fill. When a teacher assigns a project that the students aren''t particularly interested in, odds are that they will just breeze through the whole thing and not retain any of the information because they ju';

I am almost certain that this would be especially true over the summer months when students have no desire to do school work, mostly because they aren''t in school and, in the case of a teacher-designed project, wouldn''t find the assignment interesting. If teachers were to give the students the freedom to design their own projects, the students would have to be creative in making an assignment in order to keep themselves entertained. The likelihood of a student making a project on something that doesn''t interest them is very much unlikely. I truly don''t think anyone would willingly do work that didn''t interest them. Overall, I believe that a summer project designed by a teacher would be miserable and useless. Because of the standardized testing situation, students being forced to learn material that isn''t particularly important. Students feel that their success i';

As you can imagine, that can cause someone a lot of stress and actually end up limiting their ability to develop into something/someone greater. I am sure that everyone knows what it feels like to lose a little bit of confidence and determination once you get a bad grade on an assignment. After weeks and months of students learning the curriculum that the state wants them to learn, I think it important to give them the time and encouragement to look into a topic that may actually be of interest to them. Which is where the student-designed project comes into play. All students deserve to have a break from the mental battle that comes along with constantly forcing themselves to learn information that doesn''t intrigue them. A summer project should be open ended so that the students don''t fall under the pressure of meeting the specific standards of the teacher, but to feel obligated to look into something they find interest';

Not only do the students need someone physically to be there, they also need someone to model for them. All students have different ways of learning. If the students who learn by the teacher modeling, they won''t be doing very good with the computer. Not only do the students need a teacher there as a figure to respect and trust, but they also need their own privacy.

When you use the electoral vote instead of the popular votes the electoral vote exeeds the popular vote. For example when president Obama ran his electoral votes equaled 61.7 percent, but his popular vote only equaled 51.3 percent. If your a fan of Obama then you should love the fact that we use electoral votes. Electoral votes make it so that a president can only win the election if the have the trans-regional vote. A trans-regional vote means that if a president was popular in, lets say the south, but not in the west and only the south voted for him then he/she could not be elected.

You may not think so, but in electoral voting the size and population of a state matters. The more people you have in a state the more senators and people you get in the house of representatives which means that the state gets more votes towards who gets elected. A state like Florida will have more votes then a place like Maine. In popular voting there is always a chance for there to be a tie but in electoral college they avoid ties by making it an uneven number so there will be no mix ups.

After school activities should not be mandatory because of homework, others time, and because students may revolt. My first reason that after school activities should not be required, is because of homework. Students could struggle to find balance with school work and an extracurricular activity. They might need extra support from a teacher, but may not be able to receive it because of a conflict with their activity.

My next reason is that after school activities should not be required is because of peoples time. Some students already struggle to find time to have some fun when all they have to do is homework. Adding an activity could make it so they have no time to relax. Students don''t have to worry about getting a job or paying the bills. Students should enjoy the freedom they have while they can.

Students will be mad if they are required to do the activity, and teachers will be upset if they have to work overtime, but having to stay after school isn''t the only reason people would this way. Some people might not enjoy any of the possible after school activities, or the activities they want to do might be full. This will make them not feel obligated to the club or sport they chose.

Requiring that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise, hindering, and futile. For example, many students are enrolled in challenging courses.

Reasons such as not being able to be one on one with the teacher, cheating, and not staying on task are why students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home. The first reason why students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home is not having the opportunity to be one on one with your teacher.

Cheating is already a major problem most schools face and distance learning won''t help stop cheating at all. Distance learning gives studnets the chance to cheat by using any other resources they have while, for example taking a test. The disadvantage to this is that teachers or administrators would not be able to do anything about it becausse they won''t be there to see it or stop it. There would be no way of stoping students from cheating while taking a test or a quiz because no one will be able to supervise them. Also distance learning will increase the a';

The final reason on why students will not benefit from being able to attend class from home is the distractions. At school there are almost zero distractions other than other students. But in distance learning it''s almost the complete opposite. In a classroom students are not able to use their phones and talk to other students when they are learing which tends to make the student focus more on the curriculam. At home studnets are not be watched over which tends to make the student get off task.

You can''t go anywhere without seeing people on their cell phone whether its calling, texting, or on the web. I go out to dinner with my family a lot and there is always people in the restaurant on there phones. In my opinion people are addicted to using technology. I know very few people that don''t have cell phones, it''s extremely rare for someone to not have a cell phone today. Cell phone use is excepted in many places, almost everywhere except school. A lot of kids use their cell phones in school whether its aloud or not. I saw cell phone use a lot when I was in 7th grade more than I do this year. There is so much kids can do on a cell phone these days it''s hard not to have them with you all the time. I personally think cell phones should be aloud in school.

If there was an early release at school we could easily contact our parents at home or work to let them know we are getting out with school early. With cell phones in school comes big responsibility''s for students, they would have to resist texting during class when it wasn''t aloud. A good plan would be in classes that texting isn''t aloud the phone would have to be silent on there desk where the teacher could see it.

	clob2_pt1 CLOB := 'The thought of taking classes from home doesn''t sound as pleasing one would think, here''s why. Taking classes from home can cause more problems than solutions. Learning from home puts more stress on the students by relying on them to stay focused with no help. In my opinion, I believe students can''t benefit as much from taking classes from home due to lack of focus, little peer help, and barely any teacher overview. People tend to get sidetracked easily when taking classes from their home. There are more variables at home that cause distractions to the students. For example, a student is trying to understand the lesson, but his little sibling won''t stop bothering him causing him to be off-topic. Furthermore, students are more likely to be focused in class due to being in a true learning environment rather than being in the comfort of their home. Being in class allows the students to put their thoughts solely on their work. These positives of being in class are gone when students de';

In some cases, listening to a peer has proved to be more helpful than constantly listening to a lecture from the teacher. The sound of a new voice explaining the matter can really be beneficial. At home, it''s just the teacher in the video explaining the lesson and the student trying its best to understand. If it comes to a student being completely lost, a classmate is usually there to get them on back on track. Also, group work with peers is another way that benefits learning; however, that ability is hindered when learning at home due to the work being placed on just one student. Teacher overview is missed when learning at home. The presence of the teacher teaching connects to the students more instead of hearing or seeing a lecture online. Moreover, being face to face with a teacher trying to teach a student is more beneficiary than just looking online. When the teacher asks students if they need any help, it cau';

It''s important for teenagers to understand how to help others, and not just think of ourselves. Teens are selfish and they need to see how those who are less fortunate have it. For example, the Thirty Hour Famine. We could give up food for thirty hours, as a fundraiser, and give the money to a homeless shelter. Homeless people don''t have the money for food. We take eating and shelter for granted. Why do we do this when there are people out there who are starving and thirsting to death? The Thirty Hour Famine would be a great way to help out. Also, we could do something simple, such as helping with the Miracle League, for a school project. The Miracle League is a baseball team for special needs children and adults.

In paragraph 5 of Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it is stated that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars, with an even greater percent in large cities. If these cities were to stop using cars, the smog surrounding the cities would be able to clear within about a week. If all of the major cities in Europe would limit the use of cars, then the air would be much cleaner.

The article also says that in 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked and has gradually lowered since. With less cars being bought, people are saving lots of money they would be spending on repairs, gas, tires, and other things that attribute to the price of a car. Not having to worry about whether or not their car will start when they have to go to work will be able to lower a person''s stress.

	clob1_pt1 CLOB := 'I was planning a project with a group of friends for our Spanish class it was dreadful. The teacher had given us another boring topic none of us were even close to interested about, we did the bare minimum yet still had achieved a solid high grade. And in little to no time we all had already completely forgotten about the topic. School summer assignments should be student, not teacher based because Freedom promotes curiosity, Students will work harder for something they care about and Freedom provides creativity. First of all Freedom promotes curiosity, for example my mother is a famous singer here in the United States, every year Genric_City invites her to sing the national anthem and at my house we have medals and awards on every wall, my dad is a very talented guitarist who has been playing since he was six. Although they have always loved music they never pushed or forced us to try music for me and my little brother. My little brother got completely sucked into music and started te';
	clob1_pt2 CLOB := 'aching himself how to play the guitar, his curiosity is what led him where he is today. My little brother has been playing for less than a year and a half and has already played with my mom in concerts with up to five thousand people. My parents had very little to no influence to my brother because they never forced us to play. Some may believe otherwise because they might say freedom is what makes kids or teens rebellious and that thinking is reasonable but flawed due to the fact that being a bit rebellious is what gives kids or teens life experience. Albert Einstein one of the smartest men there have ever stepped foot on our planet was rebellious and would rarely attend class because his curiosity and freedom are what drove him. Secondly, Students will work harder for the things they want and are interested in. If you have interest and motivation in something it will drive you not only to finish faster but to want to learn more. We always hear the phrase ''When you get a job pick som';
	clob1_pt3 CLOB := 'ething you will love to do the rest of your life'' otherwise your time is wasted and you are just stuck on a dead end job and doing tasks you have no interest in. My uncle Genric_Name always wanted to have his very own restaurant because he loved to cook and it was one of his hobbies but my grandpa has always forced and pushed him into taking law because in south America, which is where they live, he was very strict because he wanted to have his son have a well respected job title but soon enough the years passed and he realized he as stuck at an office when all he wanted to do was leave and open his restaurant. Not long after that he quit his office job and opened his very own restaurants where he is today. Some may disagree with this idea because they think you can adapt or get used to liking something but that reasoning is flawed to the fact that some people simply never adapt or get used to something they dont enjoy doing. For Example Gareth Bale a famous soccer player from Wales p';
	clob1_pt4 CLOB := 'lays for Real Madrid a muti-million euro Spanish soccer club where he gets paid thousands of euros and has a full career but when Bale is injured he goes to play professional golf he loves soccer but he never got used to playing only soccer he also considered quitting the Spanish club only to go play soccer but he untimely stayed in soccer, even though if he quit he would of not only lost alot of money but he would have sacrificed it to do something he enjoys and that is worth respecting. Another reason that school summer projects should be student based is because Freedom promotes creativity one example of this is when I was in tenth grade my teacher, Genric_Name assigned all of us a element from the table and we were all expecting a full layout and a rubric but we didnt get one. Instead he told us it was completely up to us on how we represented the element and he would want to see some sort of presentation at the end. At first everyone was confused and a bit shocked since this was t';

As I walked into the classroom I saw all sorts of visuals about elements I had never even imagined it was interesting to see so many people with different projects but there were none alike every one had brought something completely different. Some may disagree with this idea because of too much freedom being bad for a person, but that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that freedom is what lets people make their own mistakes and if they don''t have the ability to try something when they think about trying something they will be scared of messing up.

While some students might dislike the idea of doing projects over the summer they are necessray for academic improvement. One way to increase the learning done for these projects is to have them student designed. Having student designed projects will ensure that the student will enjoy the project, increase the chance that the student will complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work. By allowing students to design the project you ensure that they enjoy the area of study. Students who do not like history should not be forced to complete project on the history of their town. The same is true with a student who doesn''t like math. I personally have expierenced this through my work in the VASTS program. The program is an NASA run organization that has allowed me to study the areas of subject that I enjoy. When a student enjoys an area of subject they are more likely to study and';

If the student does not like what they are studying the work will not be done. Allowing the student to select his or her own project will lead to higher completion rates. Universtiy studies show that when a student enjoys an aera of study they are more likely to work hard and complete the assignment on time. This is important because over the summer there are no teachers to hold students accountable. Without pushing from teachers it is important to ensure that the students push themselves. While teachers can check on student progess during the school day, this is impossible over the summer. Teachers can send emails, but students can simply delete te emails as they come in.

However, a project that the student selected will motivate them. A motivated student is more likely to create a good project and work throughout the summer instead of just the week before the project is due. Although some teachers might argue that students will come to school with different levels of knowledge because they select their own topics, this problem can be quickly solved.

The fact that students will enjoy what they are working on, be more likely to complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work make it evident that if summer projects are assigned they must be student designed. Over the summer students do not want to work and a student designed proect will help motivate the students to complete the project.

They should know that if we put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Such as if a student goes to apply to Dartmouth with a GPA of 3.8 but he did not do anything to help his community or did many sports, but then theirs another student who has a GPA of 3.2 but has helped his community a lot and has participated in many sports. Who would you think the university will pick for a spot?

So in my case I think that community service should be required because it affects the way you look toward something and will help less teenagers become less violent because they are doing stuff that helps the community and they are having fun which is better that going to go take drugs on the streets. Another reason that i think that community service should be require because imagine if one person can make a difference by planting that plant, imagine what thousands of kids can do.

Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, and that is wrong because when you are helping people it is not wasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you.

As adolescents become more reliant on technology, so does their strong need to multitask as well. Many believe multitasking benefits one to become more efficient and accomplish more tasks. Although this sounds good in theory, the outcome can produce multiple errors. The constant shift of attention causes drivers to keep their eyes off the road, which leads to constant pullovers. In addition, the driver can exceed the speed limit and not be able to see stop signs or traffic lights. This will lead the driver into an unwanted accident and cause confusion and delay among drivers. In conclusion, one should not text while driving because it jeopardizes the';

However much they may hate it, a project is a smart idea to ensure their intellectual learning continues over the extended break. With the natural dislike of summer projects, a way to make sure that students complete this project is to allow the students to design it. A student-designed project would be better than a teacher-designed project because students know how much they can handle, and it would allow the students to further their own interests and work on it on their own time.

A teachers schedule is much different than their students; so if a teacher designed their project, they would not be able to accurately plan according to how much each student could bear. Summer break is also supposed to act as a break from school, thus students should not be put over the same stress during summer break as they are during the school year.

Students could first focus the project on a subject or area of intellectual learning that they prefer and then take it from there. If a student aspires to be a lawyer when they grow up, then maybe they should design their project around the most influential lawyers in history. If a student hopes to be a marine biologist, then maybe they can design their project so as to analyze marine life on a local scale.

Summer vacation is always the perfect time to travel to other countries or just new places within the United States. Although, some of these places often do not have internet, or are hard to complete work in. If the summer projects are teacher-designed, then the project deadlines might interfere with travel, or aspects of the project may be impossible to complete while traveling.

Summer projects can often be a pain, but allowing a student-designed project would take away this pain and maintain the values of fun and relaxation all summer long.

However, in this time of relaxation, many students abandon the idea of learning completely, which causes much of the knowledge that they have acquired throughout the school year to be forgotten, defeating the purpose of even learning in the first place. Summer projects counteract this phenomenon by forcing students to utilize their brain muscles in a productive way that is different than in the school environment, where teachers are in control of the assignments. Therefore, even though teacher-created projects are the norm, summer projects should be student-designed in order to allow students to better themselves to the fullest extent.

While a small child needs the structure a teacher provides in order to learn the basics of how to function in human society, adolescents need to be allowed to break some previously set boundaries to prepare them for their adult years, where everything they do will ultimately be up to them. So, giving students the opportunity to design their own assignments allows them to formulate behaviors and habits that they need now and will need in the future like time management, organization, and self sufficiency.

But giving students an assignment in which every single idea must come from their own minds allows them to expand their mental capacity and limits greatly, by forcing them to tap into the ideas floating around in their mind that were previously suppressed by rigid school assignments and organize them into cohesive thoughts.

This can foster cheating as students can share answers between each other without learning anything, since they are not in school, which defeats the whole purpose of the assignment. Very often during the school year, students do the bare minimum on school assignments because they are too one note and don''t allow them to express themselves.

There are a bunch of reasons/answers that could influence you to make a decision. So... Why should you seek the opinion of multiple people in order to make a better choice? Well getting the opinion or answer of multiple people is important because there could be someone with better knowledge about the topic, the people you ask might have different things to say, and/or one persons opinion could be invalid or favored to one thing or another.

Now friendless and depressed, Generic_Name wished the school day could be over as he trudged off to his first class. ''Alright class,'' Generic_Name''s teacher said while students entered the room, ''Can anyone answer this question?'' No one made a sound.

Some people think a teacher-designed project is the better because, its easier for the teachers to grade, but I believe that a student-designed project is better because, it leads to more impressive work from the students and gives them a summer to do something for school while fulfilling a passion they have. First, studies show that when tasked with something that peaks your interest you care more about the final product. If students are able to design their own summer projects they will put more effort into said project. The more effort the students put in, the better the projects end results will be. If they''re given a project they have no interest in they won''t want to waste their summer completing it. Some may not even do it at all.

These emotions are deeply personal, and if a child wanted to share them he would tell you. Stealing them away with technology is a clear invasion of privacy.

Then, if students don''t want to share their emotions, they may start using their facial muscles to trick the machine into thinking they are feeling a certain way. One of the number one things all psychologists will tell their patients in dealing with emotions is not to cover them up and hide them behind other emotions.

I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guarenteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes (a very convincing number) but only 51.3% of the popular vote (not as convincing). The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301-237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370-168.

If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won,  the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states. The president can''t win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a trans-regional appeal.

Getting more opinions from different people is helpful for making a good choice because it gives you more options by default. For example if you ask multiple people for their opinion, you''d most likely get more than one option to choose from. But say you got one opinion from one person.

In the sense that you are talking to good people that you trust. Lastly, searching for more assistance from multiple people could support you because it makes more people aware of your current situation.

All of which a human can do theirself. The question in the article asks, ''Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?''

Muscles are the first step to identifying visually how a person is feeling which doesn''t exactly need a technilogical discoverance. With all that i have said, I simply think the world using technology on something so silly is a waste, humans should practice identifying those things personally and it is a good skill to learn in the real world.

When my friend was talking an online class, he didn''t have papers or notes that explained concepts to him.

I say this because people who listen to bad advice will get themselves in trouble with many people. For example let''s say that you go ask a person for some advice how to make money.

This can actually happen to anyone who is always second guessing their selves.

Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven''t completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student?

Summer break is more of an excuse for students to have fun and not worry about anything, but if you put a project for them to do they understand that they have to get it done while having a pretty long time to do it right, others will leave it for last minute.

Having teachers know their students strengths and their weaknesses, can help the teacher determine what project the student can work on that they will enjoy doing and will challenge them, helping them learn all at the same time.

Although it is a pain to be thinking about school and grades over the summer, doing some summer projects to keep our minds in check is not the worst idea in the world. However, the question of whether a summer project should be teacher-designed verses student-designed, I believe, has an enormous impact on the effectiveness and quality of the project itself.

Revising the electoral college system may seem like a bad idea but the good that could come of it overlies the bad. If the election of a president was based directly by the voters , then candidates could promise money to the people who vote for him/her. There could also be other propblems with direct democracy such as what would happen in the chance of a tie? Who would break the tie? And how would it be decided fairly.

A possible solution to the ''hostile conditions'' would allow scientist to get close enough to observe Venus, however it would cause them to be unable to get any rock samples. Humans would have to stay at least 30 miles above the surface. The temperature would still be high at whopping 170 degrees Fahrenheit, however the air pressure would be close to that of Earth''s and even survivable for humans.

In order make the main idea clear the author should have listed a few negative things, and then contradicted them with facts and supporting details.

Every child has the right to be educated. There exists plenty of qualities and values that a student can develop in a classroom such as: honesty, friendship, respect, leadership, etc. These are just some of all the attributes a student can gain by attending to school, but one of the most important qualities that a human can learn is the interaction with others.

The article mentioned ''many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn''t so much smarter cars as smarter roads.'' What that piece is stating is in order to have smart cars or driverless cars the U.S will require ''massive upgrades,'' hence the mention of smart roads. The roads will need to have built in radio signals to send messages, in binary code, to the car, to alert the car of road conditions or any problems.

Everything about driving a car on the road is a human skill, not to mention technology is known to have loop holes and gaps hidden throughout it. Statistics most likely shows that there are many ways to hack into the technology and change how a company programs their product to work. If it is not being hacked into, technology and the internet is also known to malfunction often, which could lead to innumerable amounts of incidents.

My position of driverless cars is no technology could drive a car better than humans. Driving is a human activity, it started with humans and should end the same way. I do agree the world would use less gas, but I don''t believe it is quite as safe as it seems. There are countries and people who are already in debt, we should be trying to help them out before we try to spend billions on smart roads.

Other information statesthat theyb took photoes of ''The Face with digital images, which enhances the picture three times more than a pixel picture.

People can''t trust cars to drive themselves because the car itself can''t handle some human sitituations like pulling in and out the driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. The cars are going to be to expensive anyways because not everyone on Earth is making enough money to buy one of these cars. The cars might be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all rely on the driver to navigate through work zones and around accidents.

Studies have shown that if someone is forced into doing a selected activity, they wouldn''t enjoy it as much as they would compared to the person doing the activity willingly. Some student''s already are doing things outside of school such as, helping at their local food bank, volunteering at their church, or they could just be leading a small study group.

If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, thats why it would be best if the school system stayed the same with a few minor changes to the systems.

Not with this, the electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote as stated in Source one. I know that wasnt enough to convince you so let me explain my reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college. My reasons are certainty of outcome and it can avoid run-off elections. To begin I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us certainty of an outcome. One of the reasons why this is possible is because there is a total of five hundered and thirty eight votes and thats an even number so it can happen. Many people might say what are the chances of that happening. Well it actually happend a few years ago back in two-thousand. One of the reasons for this as stated in Source three paragraph eighteen i';

As an example from the article Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis. I hope that this information has been able to push you to my side a little more but were still not done. This is one of my reasons why I think that we should keep the Electoral Vote. Finally I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it can avoid any run off elections. This is good because it solves the problem of elections in which no canadite recevies a majority of the votes cast. Some people might try to convince you and ask you what are the chances of this happening and has it ever occured before? Well I can answer both yes it can happen and it has twice, ounce in nineteen sixty eight with Nixon and a second time in nineten nint';

Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters. But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ''this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College.

New technology has been helping people decode each others emotions. The use of this technology can help people understand each other just a bit better than before. People are becoming more aware of how to decribe our emotional expressions that are on our faces. Just like with the Mona Lisa painting scientists says ''she''s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry''. The Mona Lisa painting can help us understand that even though it was painted many years ago we can still tell how she was feeling by her facial expression. This shows that we can do more than just decribe what we are feeling at the moment. This shows how we can keep people entertained. If somebody is bored of a television show or a commercial then they will not pay as close of attention to the computer then when you like the show or commercial. How would the computer ke';

This issue can be solved by the Facial Action Coding System, because the computer could recognize that person is bored and then change the type of show or commercial to what they like. If the computer reads that the person is enjoying the show or commercial, then the computer will leave the type of show or commercial the way it is. This all can be showed by what facial expression a person uses at the computer. This way people are more entertained with what a person watches. The Facial Action Coding System would help show if a person is actually learning or not while teaching. The student''s face can be recognized as confused or bored. This will help a teacher recognize that they should try a different technique as they are teaching. When a person is having ''mixed feelings'' on a subject then that issue can be addressed, so the person is no longer feeling that way.

These muscle helps scientists see if a person is pretending to be happy or is a person is genuinely happy. These muscles can tell if an important celebrity or politician is perhaps lying about liking a certain idea. This is a valuable tool to use, because if a country is wanting to go at war with another country then we can analyze the people''s emotions on the idea to see if it is truely a good idea to do. Another way it is useful to know a leader''s emotions is to see if they are scared or bluffing about an event that may or may not happen based on their emotions. Our emotional expressions can help people understand their true feelings about each other. This is a valuable source to know at school, watching tv, and even during a war.

Making students do an extracurricular activity could cause less family time, or distraction to life and school, or even make them upset because they can''t find an activity that fits them. First, some kids already have limited family time. They wake up and go to school for about 7 hours, then they come home and do their home work, and that right there is a lot of hours taken away which means only a few hours is left for family.

It is a good idea to ask multiple people for advice in ways like it gives you more than one way on how to do something, someone might have a better opinion, and one person could have better experience on the topic you are talking about. One of the reasons that seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by having more than one right way on how to do something.

For instance, if your best friend has one idea but another peer has a better approach you would go with the idea that works the best. Sometimes in life the people you that think will have the best advice might not have advice for you at all, so you would have to make the choice yourself or find somebody that you normally wouldnt ask for advice.

It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school. To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...'' (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The au';

Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states '' most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication'' (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise. In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment.

In fact, ''according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them'' (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better. Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.                 ';

Asking advice is pretty important if you''re one of those people that depend on people to make your decisions. But why should we ask multiple people for advice? Well lets start off by how advice is important. Advice is a suggestion or recommendation that a person gives to you in order help in your decision-makings. It can affect your life greatly by which choices you make. So that''s why it''s important to get feedback from multiple people. Once you have gathered information from other people, you can compare other people''s responses with others to see what would be good or bad. One example was when I asked my friends which sports I should play. I came up to at least 10 or more of my friends for advice. Then I compared some answers with others. And it seems that a lot of people thought I was good a Basketball. So I tried it out, and it was the perfect sports for me. But still, why should we ask multiple people for ';

I was either deciding if I wanted to ski or snowboard when I got there. Wasn''t sure of my decisions, I asked my family members and friends. out of 8, 6 said skiing because it was easy and it was my first time. So I agreed. Opinions can vary when asking many different people. It''s good to ask for many different opinions. Otherwise you won''t come out with a good outcome. Another example could be during science class. Sometimes you have to try the experiment 50 times in order to make your final outcome or decision. Why should we ask multiple people for advice? How does it benefit you? As a result of asking many people for their opinion, many people have matured';

This three month break, summer, to most students, is a time where they can finally let go of all their responsibilities and worries and leave them right in the classroom. Most do not think twice about what they have learned over the past semester, but instead are already steps ahead on planning what events. attractions, and/or vacations they may embark on. Teachers still try to make an effort for learners to still store information they have learned and even try add on to it by assigning projects that are aimed directly for students to complete by the next school year.

Every student will be likely to design a different version of the project and there will be no barriers to how they can let their creative minds visualize the project and ultimately complete it. Having them let their brain-storming abilities to take over and conceptualize on how they will continue to tackle the task at hand, truly sets them up for active learning and teaches them very useful future skills that they will use.

To actually learn an individual needs to be able to understand the knowledge that is going through their mind as they work on assignments, and there is truly no better way to learn than to self-learn while working on a project. Unlike tests or any other sort of assignment, projects give students more of a chance to actually learn rather than just memorizing knowledge for a sort period of time and then forgetting it the second they turn in the assignment. Making sure that their mind is continuously being subjected to complete the assignment over a long period of time consequently burns the knowledge into their brain and helps them to better retain it.

Students often look at summer assignments as needless work that a teacher wants them to complete for a grade, but if they were to honestly enjoy the work they were creating and completing then their effort would truly be expressed through their work. Having that passion to finish and be proud with the work that they complete is the leading factor for high grades, and also causes high amounts of knowledge to be learned.

However, teacher-designed projects are helpful too, they teach exactly what the teacher would teach them in class which gives learners an understanding of the content from the teachers perspective and could possibly give them knowledge on material they do not know.

To start off, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because people are lowering air pollution. In source 2, the author explains ''Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog .. rivaled in Beijing, China, Which is known as one of the most polluted cites in the world.'' This means that cars are bad for the enviroment they had to decresse the number of cars so they could stop the smog becuase they didn''t wanted to end up like china.

Never the less, air pollution is the main problem like in source 3 in Bogota ''The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'' The reason they are doing this is for people to find another way to get to their destination and to reduce smog as it states. Furthermore, I like the idea that people are limiting their car usage because there''s no more rush-hour. Advoiding traffic is great like in source 3 '' Bogota, Colombia- In a program that''s spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or tok buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic.''

Anther use is when a kid is running late and can listen to the lesson on his way to school and know what going on when he gets there.

Statistically, bullying has reduced significantly in the past 30 years, yet these are the years when online school was introduced. No one can justify targeted and repetative bullying, however, light teasing can actually create thicker skin and teach students how to cope with people being rude to them and how to handle constructive or not so constructive critisism which are heavily prevailant in the real world. Consequently, the new technology that made online school an option also created a new type of bullying, cyberbullying.

Ultimately, there are benefits and disadvantages to both online and public school and all students are different so it is up to parents and students to communicate and find what is the right choice for them.

I personally believe that a ''B'' average is to high and believe that the current ''C'' average should stay in place. I know many students who have a ''C'' average because the did poorly on one or two tests over concepts they did not grasp or students who have hit a rough patch. I do not believe that the school should punish someone who simply did not grasp a concept or had a hard time with a lesson. Everyone faces that challenge, it just effects students differently. In addition to that on our grading scale a ''C'' is listed as ''average''. The ''average'' student is indeed involved in extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs, ''average'' students hit that rough patch mentioned above, ''average'' students still give class there all and work hard to try to no longer be ''average''.

I bring this point forward because in each of these situations it is unfair or time consuming for the man or women in question. If the team coach or club sponsor checks grades then its is time consuming for them, most school coaches and sponsors being teachers themselves would not want to take another hour out of their day to check grades of each member/player.

Operating a cell while driving has always been a problem nationwide .The amount of people who think its ok operate a cell phone is ridiculous.

Most of the reasons why there is so many crashes is people can''t wait to text their friends and end up getting distracted. Which leads them to hitting something or someone it''s just sad that people can''t wait to text their friends. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who''s calling you for example increases your risk of crashing.

If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

Despite this, I think students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home, rather than at school, as it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace and it would provide a more comfortable learning environment with less distractions.

In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test.

Not only does this distract the teacher, but it also distracts me and the other students who are trying to learn the material. To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning. Other students, and sometimes teachers, are simply just added distractions that make it even more difficult for students to focus on learning the information that the teacher is trying to teach to the class.

Furthermore, I constantly find myself being more focused doing my homework rather than trying to do my work in school because I am given an appropriate and quiet learning space that helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Allowing students to learn from the comfort of their home helps minimize the many potential distractions from other students and teachers that only cause problems with the student''s concentration.

Most people receive education in a classroom setting, whether that is in a school, university, etc. However many people around the world do not have the ability to travel to a school everyday in order to pursue an education. As a result, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from having the ability to take classes from their home because it allows them to pursue an education if they cannot find transportation to school, limits distraction, and provides students with a more flexible schedule. Many individuals who wish to pursue an education are unable to because of their lack of transportation, however, through the option of distance learning an education is within reach for most people.

In addition, students are not bothered with the stress of fitting in. By removing these pressures and distractions the productivity of a student will increase. The schedule of the average high school student is very hectic, but when distance learning is implemented the chaos that they experience can be avoided. For example, the average high school student spends about six hours in school, two hours participating in extracurricular activities, and two hours doing homework. All of this work must be crammed into an extremely tight window of time in order to allow time for a sufficient amount of sleep. However, when distance learning is utilized students can take classes and complete the';

All of these are very important to the development of an individual outside of an academic setting, and distance learning makes it possible for students to dedicate more time to these activities rather than strictly academics. Although the benefits of distance learning outweigh the negatives some still argue that distance learning isn''t effective. While some say that distance learning will lead to a decrease in productivity and effort in an academic setting they are not entirely correct. Distance learning may not confine students to an academic setting for ten hours a day, but it does ensure that the student learns the material and is able to apply it to real-life situations. Productivity should also increase because students have more time to focus on personal health and other activities which they enjoy. In conclusion, distance learning is a great opportun';

All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. Summer assignments should be student-designed so those students can take interest in their study and make learning fun. Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book work from the class they don''t like.

Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning.

Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year. The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading and assessing their work.

They will also be the ones to ask questions about what they are confused on. Kids have many emotions but I do not think that it will be able to be hard to tell if they are struggling or not. They said in the passage that it is a painting ''It''s the subject of Leonardo da Vinci''s Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.''

This is a painting and there is probably not a single person with the same face as Mona Lisa. The ''3-D'' computer model could possibly show all 44 musles in the face but that would be a lot of face scanning because like I said before in my last sentence there could not possibly be someone with the same face shape. How can they test multiple people when those people could have the muscles all over there face. There is simple ones like the ''frontalis pars lateralis muscle'' which is above your eyes and the ''orbicularis oris'' which is around the mouth. that is only 2 out of the 44 muscles that they have to scan on a persons face.

	clob1_pt1 CLOB := 'Dear Florida Senator, I can''t help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College premotes equality for the candidates and the people. By using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as ''checks-and-balances.'' In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in ''What Is the Electoral College?'': ''The founding fathers established [The Electoral College] as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,'' (Office of the Federal Register 1). This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes don''t even matter due to the fact that the p';
	clob1_pt2 CLOB := 'opular vote doesn''t directly determine our nation''s President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that ''most states have a ''winner-take-all'' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,'' (Office of the Federal Register 7). This means that the popular vote does determine - for most states anyway - whether or not the candidate recieves all of the electoral votes for that particular state. Not only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in ''The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,'' Bradford Plumer whines about how, ''At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,'' going on to say that, ''Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don''t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing';

Posner makes a fair point: ''The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president...[If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President] the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn''t their president,'' (Posner 19). Moreover, Posner also writes that ''Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competing candidates - knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election,'' (Posner 20). Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedo';

It helps set you up for your job and ''adult readiness'', but first, you have to get into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in getting into college, but I wouldn''t neccesarily call it your ''make or break''. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important.

Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Being required to move and exercise would do our health and body good. Even if we don''t do a sport and we chose a club.

These projects are considered by many to be an unavoidable slog which exists only to ruin their precious vacation; yet, some claim that allowing students to design their own projects would lessen this burden.

In addition to teaching them important skills, student-designed projects are intended to stretch the limits of these students'' mental abilities.

I thought about this for a while and I believe the electoral college is beneficial to the results of the election. We are Americans. We can be innovative and change the world but we can also be lazy and uneducated. While most Americans are informed about the election and who is running, Mickey Mouse is still the most popular write-in on the ballot. Why not have a group of citizens who represent our state and party have a say in who should be president? ''..each party slects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party''s nominee'' (Source 3). The electoral college is a group of sofisticated men and women who do this as their job.

I understand that you might be saying that voters don''t vote for the president and electors overrule the popular vote. Electors are just an easier and more equal way of distributing the votes and electing a president. Only in rare cases has the electoral vote overruled the popular vote. Have you ever thought there might be a reason behind that though? Assuming the government isn''t majorly corrupt and the elections are fixed, wouldnt you think that the slate you voted for should be trusted? Maybe they know something you don''t or have witnessed the candidates actions in the past that could''ve swayed their vote. Citizens are keen but they do not know everything that goes on behind the scenes. The Electoral College makes sure that there is a transregional appeal. Not one area can overrule the other votes.

This could even lead to a civil war and make these 50 states not-so united. The fact that we have a system to keep order doesn''t mean that we should get rid of it just because people want their write-in ballot of a cartoon character to mean more. Keeping the Electoral College is necessary for the unity of our country. We should trust our slate of electors to vote the way we want them to.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from the opportunity to attend classes from home because it would make it easier to abuse the school provided system in three major ways.

In source 1, they talk about what is the Electoral College \& how it works. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. It''s process consists of the selection of the electors, a meeting of the electors where they vote for President \& Vice President, \& the counting of the votes by Congress. The Electoral College ';

Presidential election is held every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for President you help choose your state''s electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate''s electors.

Students should be able to participate in any sport in which they please to be in. There are many reasons why students should be able to be in sports no matter what there age. One reason is that the United States of America is statically the fattest country in the world. This means that in order for us to change this we need the future generation to be fit. The next reason is that if you are overweight your chances of a health disease are higher than a person who doesn''t have health issues. My final reason is that exercise is a great way to expand your mind and relax after a stressful day. After what many people have seen it is all true, the United States is the fattest country in the world! In fact i myself am overweight and many of my other friends are to. In a nationwide statistic it showed that 83% of people in the United States are either overweight or obese. ';

After she finishes her daily workout she is as loose as a goose. Nothing can get her aggregated because the exercise has cleared her mind of all negativity. In the Jersey Journal it explained how 3 out of 5 people who do exercise after a long stressful day at work are healed of there frustration. Don''t you want to be at peace? Finally people who are overweight and obese have a better chance of getting a health disease. I am overweight and i was diagnosed with high cholesterol.

So now let''s get to it shall we you readers out there. A Renaissance painting by artist Leonardo da Vinci called Mona Lisa was studied by a scientist named Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who innovated some new computer software that can recognize human emtions, working alongside with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr Huang and his colleague were developing a better way for humans and humans to communicate with each other.I agree with this claim, you wanna why? Because technlogy in general has come a long way, and th';

Like it might be a chance that a computer software can determine how we feel and not just humans in genreal, but even old paintings so long ago isn''t that incredible. But in part of the story i feel like tihs software could actually work out was that it said that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one oe more muscles is an ''action unit.'' which means that they need to scan the face of a human like features in order to scan the face. When works on thigns like this he normally relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, he is the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Edwin has classified six emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the muscles. For instance when you raise your eyebrows you''re surprised, bu';
	clob6_pt3 CLOB := 't when you raise your eyebrows down by your mouth you''re angry. Another good reason why i think this technology is really good and it can help is.That when facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Use videp imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements- from a real face such as Mona Lisa. If u weigh the different units'' the software can even identify mixed emotions. So cool that just shows you how advanced technology can be. Also each expression is cmpared against a neutral face. My final defense to back this claim up is that computers got so advanced over the years it''s kinda like it knows who to set up your mood of what you wanna see. For instance, if you smile when a Web ad appears on oyur screen, a smilar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different.

Sometimes while teaching, it is difficult to focus on students emotions and the lesson all at the same time. However, the Facial Action Coding System would take over the task of recognizing emotion, thus allowing the teacher to focus on ';

Being able to see all of these nonverbal queues would help teachers to see the level of engagement that each of their lessons creates, as well as help students that aren''t engaged. The Facial Action Coding System would additionally allow for the computer to ''modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor''. This modification would allow for students who are bored and not engaged to better understand the lesson at hand. This would likely increase the learning that occurs within the classroom, as more students would have access to a lesson that made sense to them. Additionally, this eliminates the guess work of a teacher trying to come up with an effective lesson. The computer can do it for them. Thus, time can be used more efficiently when teaching students. The Facial Action Coding System would also give a practical application for anatomy and coding within';

The use of such an interesting implement as the scanning can help students to develop newfound interests within these fields. This can serve as an excellent teaching point for students looking into the fields of anatomy and coding. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would have significant benefits on both the faculty and students of a school. It would help to make the teacher''s job easier and more effective while enabling the student to learn better. This system would create a lasting impact on the learning done by students.         ';

Getting multiple views on the topic clears up that there is not any bias coming from a persons advice. What is a bias? Bias is a positive or negative opinion that someone has to an object, place, or person. Bias is not good for giving advice because it sometimes can shows a wrongful or untrue statement about the topic.

The next reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person is it gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work. Two people might give the same advice, but give different reasons on how it will work. This can show a variety of knowledge on the concept and give even more ways to approach the situation.

Both of the people went to the water park and had different experiences on how it went. It was really just their personal preference and the only way is to go to it yourself to see how it is. Receiving multiple people for advice is shown to be better then just asking one person because multiple views on the topic clears up any biased that a person has, a greater understanding of the topic because the different reasons on why they advice will work, and multiple experiences that people have had show a variety thoughts when going to a place.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has used improved technology to help establish a connection between computers and how they are able to detect human emotions. Another man, by the name of Prof. Thomas Huang, has developed a software, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Using computers to help read the emotional expressions of students could be very valuable for teaching and improving education all around the world. Before learning about the benifits of how computers can detect emotions, it''s significant to grasp how the system works. The process begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger';

On the other hand, Dr. Huang claims that computers can even detect emotional communication when it is nonverbal.

His claim seems appealing because it''s important for teachers to help their students succeed. However, students periodically become unfocused, confused, and tired throughout the school day. Thats where advanced computers come into play. Overall, it would be in the best interest of teachers and community schools to upgrage to advanced methods of teaching, involving computers that detect human emotions.

Studies show that when a person is in a school sport, that the person wants to be in it makes the person work their hardest and get the best grades they can get. If you keep a chart and mark the grade down that people have in sports you will notice that it is high. But if you keep track of that person when their not on sports you will see their grade might be low.

It''s important to ask for someones advice is because you want to see what that person would choose. You want to always see what he/she would want to choose instead of the other things to get a point of view of what they think would be best. For example, you ask a friend if they would rather choose American Eagle or Hollister to shop at. Your friend would go with what they think is the better option and could also explain why.

Doing school at home could be difficult for some students. They would have no one to help them so if they ever have question they would have to figure it out themselves. Sometimes you just need to ask a simple quick easy question but you wouldn''t be able to if you are at home.

During that time that I wasted doing nothing I could have done my other school work. Doing your classes online is a good way to keeping up with your class because you work at your own pace, this would help you maintain the best grades possible. Another reason is that they have more time to complete their assignments. It''s good because they don''t have to worry about that the ''bell is going to ring'' and they are going to be late to class.

When a student has to design their own project, that gives the student more work than necessary for a summer assignment. If a student is given too much freedom with the project they are more likely to procrastinate and forget about the project.

For example, a student on vacation wouldn''t have time to design and complete their own project, but if there are clear guidelines for the project, the student could complete the project around their vacation schedule.

Overall, I beleive that summer projects should be designed by the teachers, not by the students.

Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests.

This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer. Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop.

However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests.

Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning.

And with our community working together to help one another we can rapidly make the world a better place. There are many ways students can help their community. For example they can cook food and send it to a local soup kitchen, donate food or clothing to the poor, or even form a resistance group to help stop world hunger! I think its possible for students my age to change the world to make it a better place. Which by that we would also be following the ways of Jesus.

While it may be unfair to impose a project only decided by teachers, this unfairness is consistent with the method of which projects and tests are given out during the school year. A student who expects student autonomy in an advanced class with a lot of content may be fustrated and even resentful towards a teacher who tries to implement teacher-designed projects during the school year. Thus, students may not be disciplined enough to listen to their teachers and do what is expect of them if they have such a different mode of learning during the school year. Furthermore, it is especially important students understand and get used to the rigor of advanced classes such as Duel Enrollment and Advanced Placement classes, which put high demands on the students from the beginning to the end of a year. Difficult classes, like Advanced Placement, are often required to give out several tests and projects of a specific regulation or design, as per the ';

Failing to model the specific design expected in the advanaced class would do a diservice to the students who are taking end of year exams, and may even lead to lower scores. Most importantly, giving teachers control over summer project ensures that they know exactly how educated each student is on the subject matter and will not have to waste time repeating material that could have been taught during the summer. Student-designed summer projects will often veer towards a student studying a topic of their own choice; thus, their peformance on such a project will only give insight on their capabilities in that subject and leave the teacher clueless as to what else the student may or may not know. For example, a student-designed summer project in calculus may have the student practice and research taking a derivative. A teacher will be able to judge this student''s abiity in differentiation. However, the teacher will have no ';

By relying on the student to design his summer project and, by extension, his preparation for a class, the teacher will be ill informed on the actual strengths and weaknesses of his or her students. This will have adverse effects on the quality of education during the school year, because the teacher may waste time teaching concepts students need no help in and failing to spend more effort teaching concepts students overwhelmingly struggle in understanding. The quality of education may suffer in other areas as well if students were to design their summer projects. Since elementary school, I remember many teachers complaining about how summer is when students'' education goes down the drain. Without the presence of teacher instruction or even projects to complete, students often fail to retain information of the previous school year. Consequentially, teachers gripe, for';
	clob2_pt5 CLOB := ' good reason, that they spend the first quarter of the new year reteaching old information. With teacher control over summer projects, students will be forced to renegage witth all the material the teacher expects them to know before returning to school. Students will not have such a large gap of instruction during the summer and, thus, will be able to learn more information at a deeper level during the school year, improving the quality of their education as a whole. Others may argue that giving students autonomy over their summer projects will make them more engaged with the material for the school year, but too much freedom may lead to a lack of understanding and excerbate disinterest with the subject matter. A student required to make a project about introduction to world history will probably not know much about the subject during the summer; thus, he or she will be more likely to feel lost and anxious about having to create such project. The student may only research the topics h';

Thus, the student has not grown in interest for the class, but has remained stagnant in both understanding and engagement with the new material of the year. Also, he or she may feel overwhelmed and cheat or simply turn in a project of bad quality in response to such a demanding project. Instead of fostering engagement, throwing students into the deep end of a class with little teacher instruction may actually scare students from taking the class in the coming year. Teacher-designed summer projects will provide the school the opporutunity to prepare students for their best chance of success in advanced classes and to teach students more information at a deeper level. These projects are schools'' best hope in ensuring students do not sweat out all their knowledge in the summer heat. ';

	clob3_pt1 CLOB := 'Dear TEACHER_NAME, My out look on the dilemma is that all students should not be required to participate in community service. I say this because some students who have extra curricular activities, would not have time for such tasks. Also, unless the service was done during school hours, other students parents ,who work late, would not have any means of transportation. There for students should have a choice on whether or not to partake in community service, for conflicts in their lives would make participating in such activity a stressful scenario. So i disagree on that part. My other opinion on this subject would be for students with low grades or disruptive behavior in class, should be required to endure the community service. It would be a helpful alternative to ISS. They would learn not to be unseemly and to act appropriately during school in addition to a new view of appreciation for their community. This change in discipline would result in less students acting up, leaving our s';

Now, that sounds wonderful but these thing can also so be a huge distraction to many. Especially when they are being used while operating a motor vehicle. For one thing, using your cell phone causes many distractions for your eyes, your mind, and your actions. It is easily possible for your eyes tom slip off the road.

In addition, your mind need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Thus, concentration is important while driving and breaking that concentration causes a risk for an accident. Secondly, texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well. Texting while driving can limit your response time to something like a car pulling out in front of you, a child or adult walking in front of you, and other things. Texting someone means that you have to put all of your attention into what you are texting which, so if you are driving and texting at the same time you are bound to miss something that you should have been paying attention too or you can hit someth';

A pedestrian can walk onto the road at anytime but it is up to the driver to pay attention to road and avoid endangering his/her and the pedestrian life. Finally, the numbers speak for themselves, too many accidents have occurred as a result of people texting and driving. People''s lives will always be endangered if people feel like the best time to call their mom or girlfriend is when they are driving.

In 1976, the Face was not that clear at the time until 1998 when it started to take more shape.
